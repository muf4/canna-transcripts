[Music]

2
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,160
What's up everybody? This is Gabby

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,960
Staten Island and I'm here with my dog

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,480
Ray. Say hi,

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,240
Ray. Ray.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,920
Hey. Oh, she's super interested in the

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,199
smells here today.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,840
And um anyway, I wanted to do another

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,559
one of my dog walking videos. My dog

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,640
walking videos have been

11
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:43,320
wellreceived. Last one was when I

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,320
announced the Gabby Staten Island Sour

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Diesel and so here it

14
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,640
is. Anyway, like I was

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,878
saying, wanted to make another video for

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,600
you. And today, the video is not as

17
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,438
pleasant as before. I'm not announcing a

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,799
new

19
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:11,199
clone. Not uh talking about an upcoming

20
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,760
podcast. Um, basically want to talk to

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,879
you about a beef I have with somebody,

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:22,400
somebody pretty high-profile

23
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:24,280
that is well-loved in the industry. And

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,240
I think he's well- loved

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,960
because of the genetics that he has. But

26
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:36,319
people really don't know who this guy

27
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:38,559
is, who he is for real. And so today I

28
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,839
decided I'm going to I'm going to tell

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,840
you what my beef is with this

30
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:50,519
guy. So first of all, what I want to say

31
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:53,280
is when I made this podcast, I made it

32
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,759
originally to respond to videos that

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,680
other people made about me. Um they

34
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,359
weren't negative. It was stuff that

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,759
Notso Dog was saying and he was just he

36
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:08,478
wasn't saying things the way I feel it.

37
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,280
You know, he was kind of quoting me or

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,239
telling people how I feel, but he wasn't

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,878
actually telling it accurately. So, I

40
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,640
made a response video to Noto Dog, who I

41
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,280
love dearly, and you should check out

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:26,439
his podcast, the Notso Dog and Crybaby

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,439
podcast. I love what they do. Anyway,

44
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:35,439
um so I made this channel first to

45
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:40,439
document my weed story. Thought it was

46
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:43,598
really important to do because to

47
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:46,318
be to be honest, I've been forgetting

48
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,359
some details. Um, but I want to be

49
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:48,518
clear, there's a difference between

50
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,319
forgetting

51
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,800
something and remembering things

52
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,199
differently,

53
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,280
right? So

54
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,199
anyway, when I made this channel, I made

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,239
it

56
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:07,598
to respond to people's videos,

57
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,239
particularly Noto Dog, Crybaby. Like I

58
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,919
said, I really like those guys. Highly

59
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,959
recommend you check out their

60
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:20,318
podcast. And

61
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:24,959
um so I made my own channel. I made a

62
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:26,238
response to those guys and it caught on,

63
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,400
you know, like right away I was getting

64
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,599
a good response from people and I

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,439
decided to just keep doing

66
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,359
it and uh really appreciate the support

67
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,079
I've been getting from all you guys. So,

68
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
at the same time that I made this

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,280
podcast, I also did something else and

70
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,119
that was I contacted my

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,000
grandmother and I told her that I wanted

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,400
to document my family story because I

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,799
have an 8-year-old daughter that um

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,640
unfortunately my mom died so she never

75
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,879
got to meet her mom and or her grandma

76
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,919
and I never knew my great-grandparents

77
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,079
on my mom's side or either side but so I

78
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,878
was talking to my

79
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,680
grandma and Um, I told her that I wanted

80
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,158
to document my family story, make like a

81
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,480
podcast, but it would be

82
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:17,719
private. And the whole idea is to

83
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,159
document my story for future

84
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,160
generations cuz obviously my story goes

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,800
way beyond um, cannabis, right? And she

86
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,240
was, you know, pretty touched by it. And

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
you know, she said she wanted to do it,

88
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,000
but one of the things she said was she

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,319
didn't want to tell the whole story

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,800
because some of the stuff with her

91
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,319
parents, it was

92
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,879
sad. And I reminded her that on my dad's

93
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:44,439
side, everyone was wiped out in the

94
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,199
Holocaust. And we can't not tell the

95
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,360
stories just because they're not happy

96
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,759
stories,

97
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,800
right? So, you know, she agreed and

98
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,120
she's currently um writing down the

99
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,360
story every day. so that we can, you

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,720
know, record stuff. She wants to be

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,360
prepared. And by the way, she's 98 years

102
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,840
old. I'd appreciate it if you all send

103
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,360
her your best wishes. I'm pretty lucky

104
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,918
to still have her. I got this beef and

105
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,840
it's with VA

106
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:18,478
Skunk. And I want you guys to know

107
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:22,079
what's going on. I I think it's about

108
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,959
time that I let the world know that me

109
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,560
and VA Skunk were not cool. because

110
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,079
everybody seems to think like we're best

111
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,519
friends because we did this podcast

112
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:35,918
together and um we have a history,

113
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,478
but we don't like each other at all. You

114
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,198
know, honestly, I can

115
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:44,038
say I don't respect this guy at all, you

116
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,199
know. And I've been

117
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,599
trying. I've been trying, but he makes

118
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,879
it really [ __ ] hard. That's the

119
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,439
reality. He doesn't make it easy.

120
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,279
So, I'm going to tell you what's going

121
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,478
on. I'm going to tell you the story.

122
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:03,758
We're going to have uh it can be judged

123
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,758
in the court of public opinion. And um

124
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,240
the first thing I want to say is I

125
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,160
invited him to do the

126
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,360
podcast. I invited him to do it and we

127
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,400
could have heavy days moderate. Okay?

128
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,439
That way we could both tell our story

129
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:21,839
publicly. And to be honest with you, he

130
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,759
was a chicken [ __ ] That's the way I see

131
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,198
it. You know, he he'll say, "Oh, I just

132
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
don't want to do it. I got no time for

133
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
it. I don't want to do your podcast. I

134
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
actually I was going to do it on the

135
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,800
Heavy Days podcast and I put that in the

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,160
text message cuz it's not like I'm

137
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,560
looking for viral views. Like I just

138
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
think it's about time that people know

139
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,319
like this is what's going on and this is

140
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,038
what I think of this guy."

141
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,639
So he refused and so I'm going to tell

142
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,279
my story myself and you know if he wants

143
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,759
to clap back on another podcast or do

144
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,758
his own thing that's fine you know

145
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,479
because like I'm prepared like I don't

146
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,680
think he has any reason to act and treat

147
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,279
me the way he does and you know I can

148
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
tell my story if he wants to tell his

149
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,758
story he can do that and then like I

150
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,918
said it can be judged in the court of

151
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,439
public

152
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:17,439
opinion. So, you know, I'm going to

153
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,360
briefly talk about the beginning of our

154
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:24,478
story cuz it's been told before on the

155
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,639
podcast with Heavy Days. Um, I really

156
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,918
like that podcast. The reason why I

157
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,840
suggested that Heavy Days moderate was

158
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,399
because I didn't want it to be like one

159
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,198
of the team on my

160
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:40,560
podcasts. And um, Heavy Days is a friend

161
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,960
of VA Skunk. So I figured like he can't

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,160
say that we're biased when we have his

163
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:50,560
friend do the moderating, right? But of

164
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,680
course he refused. And so anyway, I'm

165
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,240
going to go back and the way the story

166
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:03,560
begins is met VA skunk in Golden Gate

167
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:06,000
Park. Um I sold him weed which he loved

168
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,800
and you know that's how it all began.

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,079
sold him weed in the panhandle and he

170
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,759
sold my weed when I was first living in

171
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:16,560
California and like I didn't know

172
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,479
anybody like to the point where I lived

173
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,120
in Sonoma County and I drove down to

174
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,639
Golden Gate Park to sell my weed you

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
know that shows like what desperate

176
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,400
times it was cuz like it's one thing

177
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,479
when Jerry was in town then it was super

178
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,079
easy to sell the weed but you know when

179
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,319
the dead were on the road wasn't so

180
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,958
easy. So, um, anyway, I met him in

181
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,360
Golden Gate Park and he sold my weed.

182
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,158
That's how we became friends. Um, we

183
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,240
used to go see Jerry at the Warfield

184
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,480
together and, you know, we had lots of

185
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,839
good times together, you know, like lots

186
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,278
of good memories.

187
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,640
And so, you know, I told him, you know,

188
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,439
cuz he was traveling with the dead

189
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:01,679
still. I wasn't. I was basically just

190
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,040
based in uh Northern California. And

191
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,958
when Jerry came to town, I would see

192
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,480
him, but I wasn't like traveling the

193
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,079
whole country to see him like Jason was

194
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,240
at that point. It was actually the

195
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,639
reason why I came to California was so I

196
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,639
didn't have to do that. And um and

197
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,799
besides, I had a garden, so I couldn't

198
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,519
just like go away. You know, when you

199
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,120
got plants, they kind of like they keep

200
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,240
you home.

201
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,679
So anyway,

202
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,039
um I told Jason that, you know, when the

203
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,039
time came that he wanted to settle down

204
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,399
and get a place that I would teach him

205
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:37,519
how to grow and I'd give him

206
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:40,639
plants. And you know, when Jerry died

207
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,399
sadly in 1995, that's what happened.

208
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:47,439
Jason

209
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,879
um Jason got a place and I gave him

210
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
plants and I helped them grow. I mean, I

211
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,559
can't disagree about it being the most

212
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,399
high quality indoor I've ever seen. I

213
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,000
mean, the guy puts us Gabby grows

214
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,360
incredible wheat. He always has. I mean,

215
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,879
this is the man who taught me everything

216
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,440
I need to know on day one, cuts and all.

217
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,480
And so, you know, I was so like elated.

218
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,000
I couldn't believe it. It was like my

219
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,600
lucky day. I should take a step back,

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
and I hope you guys will tolerate this

221
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,720
cuz it's off the cuff. I'm not too

222
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,839
scripted, although I have some notes

223
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,399
that I'm going to talk about later.

224
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,000
Um, so I think it was like 1992 or

225
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,159
1993, Jason introduced me to one of his

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
friends from Virginia. I won't mention

227
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,039
him out of name out of respect. Um, he

228
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,000
introduced me to this guy and I showed

229
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,480
him some weed that I had and you know,

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,559
he showed me some weed that he had and

231
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,320
we decided to make a trade. And you

232
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:42,039
know, Jason introduced us, but you know,

233
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,200
I had a clone that I eventually traded

234
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:48,078
him, and that's how I got the Super

235
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,839
Skunk, the not the Sensei Seed. You

236
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:56,559
know, this guy made an F2 or an

237
00:10:50,839 --> 00:11:00,320
F3. And so I what happened was I drove

238
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:03,159
in my car across country with a couple

239
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,839
of um cuts of my strain called the

240
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:08,639
Francine. I named all my strains girls

241
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,480
names at the time. So I drove Francine

242
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,439
across

243
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,320
country. I met this guy. I believe it

244
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,200
was in New York City and we made a

245
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,320
trade. He gave me the skunk. I gave him

246
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,640
Francine and he actually gave me a

247
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,879
couple of clones of the skunk. And then

248
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:32,240
I took those plants up to Massachusetts

249
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:34,039
and I traded Greg for the Chem Dog, the

250
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,759
one that we now call the

251
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,759
91. And

252
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,439
um Greg got this plant. I believe later

253
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,319
on that plant's been called the mass

254
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,160
super skunk, but you know, reality that

255
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,480
thing came from Virginia and through my

256
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:53,759
hands. And so I drove those clones

257
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,519
across country again. And you know, I

258
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,480
tell the story and I'll be brief that

259
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,679
when I drove it across country, I would

260
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,039
keep it in a Dixie like a Burger King

261
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,958
cup or something like that. And it was

262
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,360
like one of those big soda cups and it

263
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,838
had a lid on it and if somebody drove by

264
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,680
I could just, you know, quickly cover it

265
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,320
or if I had to go into a gas station or

266
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,638
something. Hey, what's up, Ray? I could

267
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,639
cover

268
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,879
it. And so, um, drove that across

269
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,480
country. Probably took me like 5 days

270
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,480
cuz I I was driving by

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,039
myself. Ray really wants to say

272
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,160
hello. Anyway, so I drove it across

273
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,239
country. This is 92 or 93. And Jason

274
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,319
wasn't even growing.

275
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,360
So, you know, I have these plants now

276
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,600
for years before Jason starts growing.

277
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,440
You know, Jerry died in August of 99

278
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,680
1995. And, you know, took a minute till

279
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,040
Jason came to California, got a place,

280
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,638
and started growing. So, I'm not sure

281
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:04,480
exactly when it was, but um you know, I

282
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:10,360
had those plants for years before

283
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:13,200
um he ever did. he got his place and

284
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,200
um we were partners and you know I think

285
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,639
I made a deal with Jason that you know

286
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,560
the only thing I asked was that he sell

287
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,759
me the weed you know which I don't think

288
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:27,119
he had a problem with. Um, so

289
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:29,958
anyway, my point is is that I gave Jason

290
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,639
the Skunk and the

291
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:37,759
Chem91, you know, in I think

292
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,680
1995, late '95, something like that. And

293
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,039
I taught him how to grow, taught him

294
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,039
everything that I knew. When I did

295
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,360
settle down, he brought the Super Skunk

296
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,919
back over to the house. Now, I lived in

297
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,000
Sonoma County, same spot he was in. And

298
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,439
he he stood up on his his offer and he

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,799
he showed me what he knew and he knew

300
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,959
quite a bit. You know, he'd been growing

301
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,958
wheat for a while. Uh, and also brought

302
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,559
the Kim 91 over. And of course, he was

303
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,838
like I was like, "What about the Kim

304
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,278
dog?" And he's like, "Oh, you don't want

305
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
to mess with that one." I'm like, "Yeah,

306
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,320
that's the best one. I want to mess with

307
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,000
that one." He goes, "Well, you know,

308
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,079
it's really hard to grow. It's going to

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
break your heart." He's got a thick New

310
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,439
York accent. And I'm like, "I I can deal

311
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,040
with a little heartbreak. You know, I

312
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
want the best weed." And it doesn't

313
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,919
rude. you know, you can't smoke in a

314
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,519
bubble before 11. I was like, you're not

315
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,759
going to convince me. Like, we're going

316
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,679
to let's get that one going. So, we did

317
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,198
and I got, you know, good success,

318
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,638
beginner's luck, rooting it out. You

319
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,799
know, as soon as someone says you don't

320
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,240
want this one, that's the one you want.

321
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,679
Yeah. Yeah. Why you holding out, man?

322
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
This one's the best, but she's hard to

323
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,919
deal with. You're like, bring her on.

324
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,919
Yeah. Yeah. So, he kept his word,

325
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,838
though. Yeah. And all those years later,

326
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,000
I mean, that's rare, too, in this

327
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,680
business. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know,

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,278
word was different back then. I'd say a

329
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,719
bit, you know, like, well, quite a bit

330
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,399
actually. You know, that was your bond

331
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,240
and it would have been odd not to. And

332
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,559
we all So anyway, getting back to the

333
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:58,240
story.

334
00:14:53,559 --> 00:15:02,838
Um, Jason grew those plants and, uh, you

335
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,519
know, he held the Chem91 at least for 30

336
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,360
years, you know, so far. I'm sure he's

337
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,360
going to keep it a lot longer. And I

338
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,039
think he should be praised for it, you

339
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,440
know, like for some reason I think he

340
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,078
doesn't think I give him credit for it,

341
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,839
which I do. I'll just explain later, you

342
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,479
know, what my issues are with it. But

343
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,639
yeah, I don't know anyone that's holding

344
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,120
on to strains. Maybe not so dog has held

345
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,360
on to some strains that long, but it's a

346
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,360
really [ __ ] long time to hold on to a

347
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,720
cannabis strain without using tissue

348
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,278
culture and definitely deserves props

349
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,800
for it.

350
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,639
Um

351
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:41,120
anyway, so I'm gonna jump forward in

352
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,759
time because, you know, most people know

353
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,078
that part of the story. Most people know

354
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,919
about I shouldn't say most people, but a

355
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,599
lot of people. There's other podcasts

356
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,759
where they talk about it. And um so I

357
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,680
don't need to to go in all that too

358
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,480
deeply, but what I want to talk to you

359
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,519
about

360
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,320
is how I lost the

361
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:07,839
skunk. And before that, I'm going to

362
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,120
start telling you about the beef that I

363
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:15,399
have with Jason. Let me tell you how the

364
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:19,639
story goes, like how Jason and I stopped

365
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:23,519
talking. And so this is about 15 years

366
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:26,720
ago. And we, you know, agreed to do a

367
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,759
breeding project together. And I gave

368
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,440
him a bunch of genetics. I gave him

369
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,320
seeds that I purchased in

370
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,079
Amsterdam and um then I also gave him

371
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,480
some clones that I had. I gave him the

372
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:43,599
cherry pie and I gave him the Master

373
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,320
Kush. Um both of those clones were

374
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,360
highly desired at the time and I believe

375
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,879
he still has both of those strains. Um

376
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,959
and he actually told me that he still

377
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,480
has these seed packs which really kind

378
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,239
of bummed me out. But anyway, I know my

379
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,680
story is rambling. I'm sorry. I'm a

380
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,039
little high on sour diesel and I'm a

381
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,719
little upset about this stuff to be

382
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,838
honest with you. But

383
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,480
so anyway, we're supposed to do this

384
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:12,399
breeding project together and I give him

385
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,240
this genetics and a month goes by which

386
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,919
isn't really that long, right?

387
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,480
Um but the next time I see him, you

388
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,280
know, he comes to my store. I had a grow

389
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,838
shop in Santa Rosa, the Garden Spout. He

390
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:29,678
comes to my store and you know the way

391
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:33,038
he tells the story and you know I don't

392
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,880
want to dispute this because you know I

393
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,319
was going through some [ __ ] but he said

394
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,200
like he came to the store and I was in a

395
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:43,599
bad mood and yeah like totally possible

396
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,279
I was in a bad mood and I was a little

397
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,119
short with him maybe. I don't think I

398
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,000
like raised my voice. I think I just

399
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:53,279
might have been

400
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,720
like I might have been rude and I'm not

401
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:59,160
um defending it, you know, like I'm

402
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,480
actually if I was rude, I'm sorry about

403
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,960
it. Ask Jason. I say, you know, what's

404
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,599
going on with that breeding project? He

405
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,279
says, I have no intention of doing that

406
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,798
with

407
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,839
you. And that [ __ ] super pissed me

408
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,519
off. And I was already in a bad mood.

409
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:20,839
So, like we got into an argument about

410
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:22,359
it and we didn't speak for over 15

411
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,119
years.

412
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,359
Now, I want to point out I had purchased

413
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,519
a greenhouse. It was a small light depth

414
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,079
greenhouse that had a motor on it that

415
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,519
it would cover the the greenhouse

416
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,599
automatically so you didn't have to drag

417
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,879
a tarp. And I gave him all these

418
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:42,480
genetics. He never returned them.

419
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,360
greenhouse, you know, that was like 2500

420
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,640
bucks wholesale because I I owned a

421
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,159
hydro store. I think it was like a

422
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,480
$5,000 greenhouse and never gave me my

423
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,600
seeds back. You know, the clones at the

424
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,279
time, I don't know that I needed those

425
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,480
back, but the seed packs were from

426
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,960
Holland that I had been saving for

427
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:05,599
years. So, um, one of them that I

428
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:09,440
remember was, um, from TH Seeds. He was

429
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:13,279
the sage and sour, which I really want

430
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,200
those seeds even today. And uh later on

431
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,399
you'll hear that he actually still has

432
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,000
those seeds. Um but anyway, I got pissed

433
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,840
off

434
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,880
and you know, he got upset, you know,

435
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:29,399
because words were said and we didn't

436
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,440
talk for 15

437
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,759
years. With that, it's time to light

438
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,759
another joint.

439
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:48,480
And when I finally saw him 15 years

440
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:52,600
later, I realized or to myself, I said

441
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,839
that our friendship mattered more to me

442
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:56,959
than, you know, the gen. First of all, I

443
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,839
thought he did the breeding project.

444
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,240
Turns out he never even did it. Um, but

445
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,079
like I felt like he ripped me off, took

446
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
my genetics, did a breeding project, and

447
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,119
never gave me anything. And I only found

448
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,880
out like short amount of time ago that

449
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,359
he just never did anything. But still,

450
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:18,400
he had my greenhouse, didn't return

451
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:22,959
it. Anyway, so 15 years I'm thinking

452
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,880
this guy, he like stole my [ __ ] you

453
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,440
know, made did a breeding project,

454
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,200
didn't give me anything, and took my

455
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,640
greenhouse and didn't give me anything.

456
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,200
And uh like I said, Jason might have a

457
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,720
different side of the story, but uh he's

458
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,319
not here today to tell it, you know. So

459
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,519
the bottom line is we didn't talk for a

460
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,879
long time. And when I saw him, I was

461
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,839
like I thought to myself, hey, you know

462
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,039
what? This guy's an important part of my

463
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:54,158
history. And despite everything that

464
00:20:51,038 --> 00:21:00,319
happened, I still have love for him. And

465
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:01,640
I told him that. And um I wanted us to,

466
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,079
you know, be friends

467
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,679
again. And you know, he

468
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:11,918
agreed. And

469
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,240
um eventually

470
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,280
uh well you know we talked about like us

471
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,120
doing a collaboration together in the

472
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:22,000
future and he hooked me up with Breeders

473
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:26,639
Direct who Michelle from Breeders Direct

474
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,119
is his girlfriend and that's been a

475
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,280
really good thing for me. You know like

476
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,759
I've been selling clones on the Breeders

477
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,759
Direct website and I'm grateful for

478
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,759
that.

479
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,679
Um, we talk about doing another

480
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,240
collaboration

481
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,919
because I think that's

482
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,200
what the market wants that the market

483
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,480
would really appreciate, you know, me

484
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,640
and him working together again. And and

485
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,558
then me and me and me and my buddy Gabby

486
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,960
have some good news, too. We're uh we've

487
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,440
decided to uh team up and and start

488
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,759
working on providing some genetics

489
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,000
focusing on clones and we're going to do

490
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,480
some seed collaborations together with

491
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,839
uh some breeding projects. Chem dog

492
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,319
heavy of course. Um and so, you know,

493
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,918
I'm super [ __ ] excited about that.

494
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,599
I'm super excited to be working with

495
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,960
Gabby. We've had literally 30 solid

496
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,199
years of knowing each other as of

497
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,640
February this year. We met in February

498
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,640
of 1993. all those years ago. And so it

499
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,360
just I mean we talk a lot more now and

500
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,280
it just feels good and um I'm [ __ ]

501
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,439
excited. I know my friend Gab is excited

502
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,918
and you know we're ready to just get it

503
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,840
going on and kind of you know put the

504
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,600
put the old school and the Kim and the

505
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,119
Kim kind of stuff, the gas back in

506
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,879
what's available out there for folks.

507
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:51,279
You know, they're definitely hungry for

508
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,200
it. So yeah, that's it. Wow. This collab

509
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,599
that sounds really awesome. When did

510
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,038
this first uh come into life? You know,

511
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,240
when did the wheels start turning on

512
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:03,679
that one? 30 years ago. Yeah. 30 years

513
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,679
ago. It's exactly what I was saying.

514
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,480
We planned this all up 30 years ago.

515
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,798
Yeah. I mean, Gabby, he's, you know, uh

516
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,880
he owned a chain of not a chain, but you

517
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,720
know, several hydro stores for a while

518
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,200
and then that petered out and went went

519
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,360
down. Now he's uh selling clones, you

520
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,360
know, and selling genetics. And so we we

521
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,479
we we definitely work together on that

522
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,158
level. You know, we have a few

523
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,759
collaborations going. So he's still

524
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,600
fully involved. It's some of us are

525
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:31,679
lifers, you know, this is what's at, you

526
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:33,918
know, and so we talked about it and, you

527
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,360
know, he agreed that it was a good idea

528
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,880
and I gave him a whole bunch of genetics

529
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,319
again. He did he did breed with these

530
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,400
genetics. He told me that he's gotten

531
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,678
seeds from these genetics already. He

532
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,679
later on told me that he thought most of

533
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,480
the genetics were garbage, but he's

534
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,240
like, "Except for this one." And then

535
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,839
his Michelle, his girlfriend, says, "Oh,

536
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,079
yeah, and that one was really nice,

537
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,480
too." And like I know the strains that I

538
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,639
gave him, you know, they were they were

539
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,360
good. There was one that I really liked,

540
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,360
the deep end butter and he didn't like

541
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,000
it because it wanted to go into flour

542
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,000
real fast. Like it would just flower

543
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,279
under veg. And I understand that's a

544
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,119
problem when you have a hard time

545
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,359
getting a plant to veg. When I grew them

546
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,038
under 24 hours light, they would veg. If

547
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,959
I grew them under 18 hours light, they

548
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:21,038
would flower. But the thing about this

549
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,519
plant is it would finish in six weeks

550
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:26,000
and produce beautiful purple buds even

551
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,839
when it's hot and it had a loud turpp

552
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,919
profile. I thought it was an excellent

553
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,278
candidate for breeding, you know. So

554
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,480
that's the only one that he could say,

555
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:33,519
"Hey, you know what? This is why I don't

556
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,599
like it. This is why I'm not going to

557
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,720
breed with it." And I would get it. The

558
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,038
other ones for fire, he bred with them.

559
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,038
And

560
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:51,359
so I want to tell you guys something

561
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,559
that happened with me and Jason and

562
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,719
Bridges Direct that when this happened,

563
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,558
it was kind of like our friendship took

564
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:04,720
a turn for the worst and never got

565
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:05,918
better. And so I made a mistake. And I'm

566
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,640
going to be honest with you guys about

567
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,480
it. And I was already honest with them

568
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,159
like immediately after the mistake was

569
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,038
made. And you know, I don't think that

570
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,039
it's the type of thing that the reaction

571
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,879
should have been what it was, but I'm

572
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,919
going to let you know and we'll let the

573
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,880
court of public opinion decide. So, I'm

574
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,400
selling clones on the Breeders Direct

575
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:33,120
website and I'm talking to the clients,

576
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,480
you know, like people will message with

577
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:40,399
me message me on Instagram. somebody

578
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,000
purchased clones from Jason and you know

579
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,679
he was worried about his order. It was

580
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,839
taking a couple of days to be honest

581
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,759
with you. The guy was like um very

582
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:51,079
impatient but

583
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:54,879
um Jason wasn't

584
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:57,278
responding and so I responded to to

585
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,400
because he messaged me directly and so I

586
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,558
responded. And I was like, "Hey, you

587
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,960
know, I I'll help you take care of it."

588
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:07,599
And um I did, you know, um Michelle and

589
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,360
Jason responded and he eventually got

590
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,678
his

591
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:14,639
stuff.

592
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:17,038
Um so I became friends with this guy and

593
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,320
if you know a lot of people that message

594
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,240
me on Instagram, we become friendly, you

595
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,960
know,

596
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,200
because that's what I do. I make friends

597
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
and

598
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,720
um you know I had sold him a bunch of

599
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,079
clones through Breeders Direct.

600
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,480
Everything always went through Breeders

601
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,839
Direct. He brought

602
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,000
like I don't know at least eight

603
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,399
different strains off of me. Every

604
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,278
purchase goes through Breeders Direct.

605
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,798
And um then he asked me if I could get

606
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,359
other genetics and I was like, "Yeah, I

607
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:50,038
can get them, but I can't get them. Like

608
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,359
I don't have them and I have to buy a

609
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,480
flat and get my

610
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,558
dog." So anyway, he wanted these

611
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,278
genetics. I knew another nursery that

612
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,918
had them and I actually wanted these

613
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,880
genetics to sell on Breeders Direct. And

614
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,960
so I made a deal with him outside of

615
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,600
Breeders Direct. And the deal was that

616
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,600
he pays for the genetics. Like he pays

617
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,918
for the

618
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,839
flat and that I would send him a few

619
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,520
clones of it and then he'd have the

620
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,678
genetic and then I'd have the genetic

621
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,319
and I could sell the rest, you know,

622
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,480
through Breeders

623
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:29,839
Direct. And so I made the deal with to

624
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,278
do that with him for like three strains

625
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:37,038
and he like immediately paid me.

626
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:39,679
And so he sent me the money. I hadn't

627
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,839
even gotten the clones yet, you know,

628
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,240
might have been like a couple of days

629
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,879
later that I spoke with Jason about it

630
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,519
and I told him, I was like,

631
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:56,520
"Hey, this is what I did. I got these

632
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:59,200
clone. I took this guy's money and

633
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,918
um you know for these clones which I'm

634
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,360
going to get from this nursery and then

635
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,679
I'm going to keep the rest and sell

636
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,759
them. Now I said I'm not making any

637
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,640
money on it. He's literally paying for

638
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,240
the

639
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,640
flats. But, you know, I just wanted to

640
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,640
be open with you guys. And if you think

641
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,960
that I, you know, owe you something, I'm

642
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,679
happy to give you the commission even

643
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,200
though I'm not making money on

644
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,798
these. And Jason was like, "Well, you

645
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,480
know, you should have spoken to Michelle

646
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,278
first. She probably would have given you

647
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,000
the money for the clones. Um, but yeah,

648
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,079
let's talk to her about it." Now, I

649
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,079
should make this point.

650
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,678
I wasn't allowed to speak to Michelle.

651
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:44,079
Like Jason had this thing where I had to

652
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,278
only communicate via email with her. I

653
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,000
was allowed to speak to him on the

654
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,480
phone, but I wasn't allowed to speak to

655
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,119
her. Okay? So, I had to send this email.

656
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,720
And in the email, I said, "Hey,

657
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,759
Michelle." And I could actually look it

658
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,640
up, but I'm paraphrasing. Said, "Hey,

659
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,119
Michelle, you know, hope you're doing

660
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,720
well. Just wanted to let you know that I

661
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,239
did something and I want you to know

662
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,720
about it."

663
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,919
Um, I spoke to Jason about this and I,

664
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:16,519
you know, let him know that I purchased

665
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:21,520
these clones with money that I got from

666
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:23,000
X. And, you know, they were pissed. And

667
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,918
to be honest with

668
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,640
you, I think I should have spoken to her

669
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,399
about it first, but if I was trying to

670
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,320
be sneaky, I wouldn't have told her

671
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:36,719
about it at all. Right? you know, I out

672
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,158
of my own valition, you know, before the

673
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
clones hadn't even been shipped yet. I

674
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,760
even told them, I said, I can send the

675
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:45,759
money back, you know,

676
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:47,038
um I told them what I had done cuz I

677
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,319
realized like, hey, I should have talked

678
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:52,879
to them first. And you know, they were

679
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:56,158
pissed about it. And frankly, Jason

680
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,919
didn't talk to me at all via phone or

681
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,278
text message for over six

682
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,679
months. I think it was it was longer

683
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:08,000
than that. Um, he was so pissed that I

684
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:11,200
did this because he said that when I and

685
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,960
it's in an email, right? So, like it's

686
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,399
not like he said, she said, like you can

687
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,240
read the email and he said that I threw

688
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,479
him under the bus and that I made it

689
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,599
sound like he knew what I was

690
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,599
doing, but he didn't. He knew what I did

691
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,959
and I told him because I would speak to

692
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:33,359
him on the phone and I wouldn't speak to

693
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,679
Michelle. Okay. So, I I was never making

694
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,918
it out like he knew what I was doing and

695
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,399
he was cool with it. It was like he knew

696
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,080
what I did and I talked to him about it

697
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,839
and we talked about that I should talk

698
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:48,038
to you about it and that's what I'm

699
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:50,879
doing. Right. So, anyway,

700
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:52,278
um that like forever changed my

701
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,799
relationship with

702
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:58,798
Jason. He he didn't communicate with me

703
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,879
and if he did it was really short and

704
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,599
you

705
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:08,000
know do I think I made a mistake?

706
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:11,359
Absolutely. I owned it and I apologized.

707
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,119
I tried to make it right. You know, you

708
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,359
know, like I said, I think it's pretty

709
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,719
clear that I didn't have an intention of

710
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:21,759
stealing

711
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,360
clients. So Jason doesn't talk to me,

712
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,519
won't respond to my messages. is I ask

713
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,359
him for a meeting after meeting, he

714
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,200
won't do it, won't take my calls, won't

715
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:33,599
respond to my text messages. So, I'm

716
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,759
getting frustrated. And you know, one of

717
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:39,558
the big reasons why I'm frustrated is

718
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:42,839
because I don't have the Chem

719
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:45,359
Dog. Okay? I

720
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,119
mean, I lost everything. I not only

721
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:50,079
don't have the Chem Dog, but I don't

722
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:53,199
have any of my genetics. Okay? I lost

723
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,960
some in unfortunate events. Um, myo

724
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,360
house burned down. I'm going to tell the

725
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,840
cardboard box story about the skunk in a

726
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:04,839
little bit, but um, I lost all my

727
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:04,839
genetics and

728
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,720
um, you know, I've been wanting the chem

729
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:13,759
dog back, but I've been struggling to

730
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,839
ask Jason for it because he's so

731
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,119
difficult and honestly so [ __ ] tight

732
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,798
with that stream.

733
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:24,639
So eventually he's ignoring my text

734
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:28,200
messages and I've already given him a

735
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,120
bunch of genetics for a collaboration

736
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,798
project. Okay. And he's informed me that

737
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,798
he's bred with them already, that he's

738
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:38,519
gotten seeds. He told me he was going to

739
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:41,519
send me some like over a year

740
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,599
ago. I gave him these seeds. I I gave

741
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,240
him these genetics. I thought we had an

742
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,398
agreement to do a collaboration. And

743
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,798
proof of that is if you go on the Heavy

744
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,719
Days podcast that I did with him, we

745
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,599
actually talk about it. We talk that

746
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,880
we're doing a collaboration. So, like we

747
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:01,038
we actually announced that we intend on

748
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,880
doing work together. And then me and me

749
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,359
and me and my buddy Gabby have some good

750
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,440
news, too. We're uh we've decided to uh

751
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,759
team up and and start working on

752
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,000
providing some genetics, focusing on

753
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,158
clones, and we're going to do some seed

754
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,720
collaborations together with uh some

755
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:20,799
breeding projects. Chem dog heavy of

756
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,558
course. Um and so, you know, I'm super

757
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,879
[ __ ] excited about that. I'm super

758
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,918
excited to be working with Gabby. We've

759
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,080
had literally 30 solid years of knowing

760
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,038
each other as of February this year. We

761
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:35,759
met in February of 1993. all those years

762
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:38,398
ago. And so it just I mean we talk a lot

763
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,079
more now and it just feels good and um

764
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,558
I'm [ __ ] excited. I know my friend

765
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,960
Gab is excited and you know we're ready

766
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,879
to just get it going on and kind of you

767
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,880
know put the put the old school and the

768
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,480
Kim and the Kim kind of stuff, the gas

769
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,080
back in what's available out there for

770
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,079
folks. You know they're definitely

771
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,480
hungry for it. So yeah, that's it. Wow.

772
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:01,038
This collab that sounds really awesome.

773
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,240
When did this first uh come into life?

774
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,519
You know, when did the wheels start

775
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,038
turning on that one? 30 years ago. Yeah.

776
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,440
30 years ago. That's exactly what I was

777
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:13,800
going. He never told me that he doesn't

778
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,679
want to. And you know, he says,

779
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,839
"Yeah, like we don't have a

780
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,838
collaboration

781
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:22,799
agreement." And I'm like, "All right,

782
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:26,719
whatever. That's fine." I said, "Well,

783
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,359
can I get some of those seeds?" Right. I

784
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,199
gave you the genetics. Ray sees I'm

785
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,000
upset. She wants to make me feel better.

786
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,598
Um, I gave you these genetics. You bred

787
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,519
with them. How about you give me some

788
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,720
seeds? He says, "We don't have a

789
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:42,960
collaboration agreement." So, I say,

790
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,039
"Okay, how about the Chem Dog? Can I get

791
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,480
a cut of the Chem Dog?" And he's like,

792
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,878
"We don't have a collaboration

793
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:55,119
agreement." Which wasn't the question.

794
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:57,118
Bottom line is like he brags on podcasts

795
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,960
about how he kept this strain for 30

796
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,838
years and that he's given it back to so

797
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,000
many people but he's never given it to

798
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:06,400
me

799
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,320
ever. Okay. And I can't remember and I'm

800
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,880
sure he'll correct me but I can't

801
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,119
remember him giving me a single clone.

802
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,480
And you know like I just recently you

803
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,720
know in the last few years gave him a

804
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,280
whole bunch of genetics. Okay. I think

805
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,919
like six or seven different strains.

806
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,599
He's never offered to give me a clone.

807
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,800
Even when I showed interest in a plant,

808
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,079
I was like, "Oh man, that's really

809
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,119
nice." You'd think he'd be like, "Oh,

810
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,200
you want one? No problem." Because

811
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,320
that's what I did. Okay. And

812
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:35,838
um so he's never given me a single

813
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:40,079
clone. And when I ask him for the Chem

814
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:41,599
Dog, he just dodges me. And so I don't

815
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,519
respond. You know, like we don't like

816
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,440
communicate very much for a while. Then

817
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:49,519
I'll drop him another message and uh ask

818
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,960
him about the Chem Dog. Hey, you know,

819
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,759
I'm going to do a breeding project. I

820
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,920
really would like to include the chem

821
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,520
dog, you know, and he either ghosts me

822
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,720
or says, "Hey, you know, we can have a

823
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,759
meeting, but it'll have to be on my

824
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:01,279
schedule." And I'm like, "Hey, no

825
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,280
problem. Let's schedule a meeting. Tell

826
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,720
me when's good." Then he'll be like,

827
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,720
"Okay, how about tomorrow?" And I'm

828
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,959
like, "Sure, tomorrow's fine." Then

829
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,399
tomorrow comes along and I message him

830
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,159
like, "Hey, can we have a meeting?" and

831
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,119
he freaks out because he's too busy and

832
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:16,399
and can't do it or really doesn't want

833
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,240
to do it because he doesn't want to talk

834
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,400
to me about giving me the

835
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:25,279
chemog. And

836
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,760
so, literally, it's been like six or

837
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,839
seven months that I've been periodically

838
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,599
asking him when I can get a cut of the

839
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,759
Chem

840
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,519
Dog. And, you know, he doesn't want to

841
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,680
give it to me. And in the meantime, and

842
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:42,800
I know he recorded it a while ago, but

843
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:46,559
um the first podcast of the day episode

844
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,359
comes out and you know, he talks about

845
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:53,358
me and he talks about how he's given all

846
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,880
these people the Chem Dog back. Um which

847
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:56,719
by the way, he lost it too and had it

848
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,240
given back to him. But he, you know,

849
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,279
only for a couple of weeks he lost it,

850
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,039
but you know, still he lost it. And you

851
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,839
know, Ben from IC Collective gave it

852
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,400
back to him. If it wasn't for

853
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:13,320
Ben, Chem Dog wouldn't have it. Excuse

854
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:16,838
me, not Chem Dog. Uh Jason VA skunk. And

855
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:19,039
so anyway,

856
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:21,519
um he doesn't want to give me the Chem

857
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:24,199
Dog back. I keep messaging him about it.

858
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:28,880
Doesn't want to give it back.

859
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:31,000
And a few weeks ago, the clone, he

860
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:36,160
decides to release a couple of

861
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,239
them. Okay. And so he puts it up for

862
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:42,639
sale and I'm like I'm I'm just like in

863
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,399
shock. I've been asking him for a cut,

864
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,159
you know, for six, seven months. Doesn't

865
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,599
want to give it to me and then he just

866
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:52,000
puts it on sale. And so I put an order

867
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,480
in for it and then I sent him a text

868
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,280
message with a screenshot of my order

869
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,760
and I said, "Hey, I guess I gotta, you

870
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:05,440
know, pay 500 bucks to get the Chem Dog

871
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:08,079
back, right?" And so he never processes

872
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,720
my order. And I think it's like a couple

873
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,079
of days later, I'm like on the phone

874
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:18,319
with a friend and he's calling me up.

875
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,480
So, I take the call and I'm like, "Hey,

876
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,240
uh, I'm surprised to hear from you."

877
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,480
He's like, "Why?" And he makes it out

878
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,479
like, "Why would I be surprised to hear

879
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,519
from him when like I never talked to him

880
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,320
and he's like been super pissed at me

881
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,320
over something that I I think is

882
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,680
seriously blown out of proportion."

883
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,359
Okay. Um, now, nonetheless, I apologize.

884
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,960
He calls me up and I say, "Yeah, I

885
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,719
ordered that clone." He's like, "Yeah,

886
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,280
I'm just going to send it to you." And

887
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,879
I'm like, "Oh, great." You know, I'm

888
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,400
like just so happy at this point because

889
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm like, "I'm finally going to get the

890
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,838
Chem Dog back. Jason's finally going to

891
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,519
give me the Chem Dog." Um, and then we

892
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,480
start talking about some personal

893
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:02,358
problems he he has. And I'm not going to

894
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:05,119
get into it, uh, his private business.

895
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:07,400
Um, but what I will say is that I talked

896
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,920
to him

897
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,760
for eight hours over the course of a

898
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,200
couple of days, like trying to like help

899
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,880
him and be a friend. And in that time,

900
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:22,239
like we didn't really talk about the

901
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,240
Chem Dog, you know, like at the end of

902
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,000
the first conversation after like six

903
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,118
hours, you know, he's like, "I got to

904
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,960
go." I was like, "Hey, wait, you know,

905
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,519
can we just talk about the Chem Dog for

906
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,720
a minute?"

907
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:36,480
Um, like I said, I was trying to be a

908
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:38,639
friend and he said, "Well, okay, you

909
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,159
know, I'll get you the clone, but I

910
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,239
don't want you to sell it for 3 to four

911
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:43,759
months, and when you sell it, I want you

912
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:48,078
to agree to sell it for the same price

913
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:52,240
as me." And to be honest, I was a bit

914
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,240
takenback by this because

915
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,358
like for him to put restrictions on me,

916
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,519
I felt would be is kind of ridiculous.

917
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,639
Um, number one, he's selling the clone.

918
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:06,239
Number two, um, I gave him the clone,

919
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,759
and when I gave it to him, I asked him

920
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,838
to not give it to anyone, and he did.

921
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,359
Now, I'm no longer upset about that. I'm

922
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:14,880
actually glad that happened. And I think

923
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:18,719
that that's why a bunch of good genetics

924
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,358
were made. But he's asking me to agree

925
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,118
to not sell it and to not and to charge

926
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,799
a certain price for it. But when I gave

927
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,960
it to him, he didn't follow his

928
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,760
agreement. Right? The other thing is

929
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,880
he's selling it to the public. And so I

930
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,800
asked him, I said, "Hey, you know, when

931
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,358
you sell it to these people, do they

932
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,280
have any agreement to not sell it or to

933
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,519
sell it for a certain price?" And he

934
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,240
says, "No, cuz I'm selling it to the

935
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,920
public, but you're my friend, and you

936
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,399
know, I should be able to ask you to not

937
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,320
be my competition."

938
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,760
And

939
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,119
so while I thought it was completely

940
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,400
wrong for him to do

941
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,079
that, I um I agreed. I said, "Hey, you

942
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
know what? I wasn't planning on selling

943
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,599
it anyway. I just really wanted it for

944
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,079
breeding. I'm surprised that you're

945
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,480
selling it. You know, I just wanted it

946
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,440
to breed with

947
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:15,760
it." And

948
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:18,318
um so I I agreed. And so the next day or

949
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,160
maybe a couple days later, he flew from

950
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:23,679
Montana to LA

951
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:26,759
and I believe he fulfilled all the

952
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:30,159
orders that were taken for the Chem

953
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:33,839
Dog, but he didn't ship me mine, you

954
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,920
know, and um he had a really busy week.

955
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:36,960
He's off to

956
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,119
Barcelona, you know, the end of this

957
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,199
week. So, you know what? I I didn't make

958
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,720
a big deal about it. you know, I just

959
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,318
figured, all right, just gonna

960
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:52,318
wait.

961
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:55,119
And but, you know, it's [ __ ] with me.

962
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:57,519
You know, it really just bothers me that

963
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,400
he like knowing that he shipped it to

964
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:05,039
other people, but like he didn't send me

965
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:07,200
one even after I agreed to um abide by

966
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,800
his terms, which I think were over the

967
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:13,879
top.

968
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:17,599
So not next thing that happens is

969
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,640
Instagram [ __ ] trolls me. So like I'm

970
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:24,280
already upset at Jason and on the top of

971
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:28,639
my feed on Instagram comes a post from

972
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:31,040
2017 from the podcast saying this is VA

973
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,759
skunk's first garden and he's growing a

974
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,759
super skunk. The video, the pictures on

975
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,400
the podcast were from Jason's first

976
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,280
garden, which I completely help him set

977
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,119
up. Gave him the

978
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,240
genetics. And

979
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,559
uh I comment on the post, I say, "I gave

980
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,000
him all of

981
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:51,279
that." Okay, it was a super skunk.

982
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,440
Everyone knows that I gave him the

983
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,119
Chem91, but probably few people know

984
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:00,440
that I gave him the Super Skunk.

985
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:03,519
And you know, he's said that Staten

986
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,079
Island, which is what he called me, um,

987
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,519
gave me these

988
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:08,839
cuts. And so me saying that I gave him

989
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:12,639
that isn't

990
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:14,799
like a jab on him or anything like that,

991
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:18,000
but I get a response and I'm reading it

992
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,160
now. It says, "The super skunk, lol.

993
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,318
It's too bad you killed it. Wish we had

994
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,239
that one still. It died in a hot

995
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,039
cardboard box in front of your house.

996
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:30,358
one of the worst things ever happened in

997
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:33,838
modern cannabis. Kind of a bad

998
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:36,119
memory. I sent him a message. I'm going

999
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:39,440
to read you that

1000
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:41,680
one. I said, "Buddy, I feel like you

1001
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,318
just called me out publicly on Instagram

1002
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:46,159
for killing the VA skunk." I said, "I

1003
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:47,838
gave you those genetics. That's not me

1004
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,000
calling you out or publicly saying

1005
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,838
anything negative about you. I want us

1006
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,318
to be friends and work [ __ ] out. So, I

1007
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,318
just want you to know I I said I just

1008
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,480
want you to be real and let you know

1009
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,159
when I see these posts. It triggers me.

1010
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,079
It's been upsetting me because I've been

1011
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,920
doing breeding. I'm getting ready to

1012
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,839
flower the red grape leanese and Cali

1013
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,838
nest I have and I would have liked to

1014
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,920
cross it with a dog, but I don't have

1015
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:12,559
it. You shipped it out to others this

1016
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,159
week, but not to me. I even tried to

1017
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,000
order it from you because I really need

1018
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:19,519
it and it stings. I'm just being real.

1019
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm probably not going to be able to

1020
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,440
breed with it this round, and who knows

1021
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,920
when I'll be flowering these males

1022
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,159
again. Jason's reply is, "I'm sorry you

1023
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,280
feel that way, but that's my story to

1024
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:35,199
tell. LOL. It's not like I went on

1025
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,040
Instagram today to tell that story, but

1026
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,358
you prompted it. I don't speak for

1027
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,838
marketing purposes. Yours are my own,

1028
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:45,000
but I have tons of story, a whole bucket

1029
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,599
full." So I

1030
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,559
respond,

1031
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:53,400
um, I'm getting it

1032
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:56,519
back. Oh, yeah. So I say, I'm getting it

1033
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,440
back. And his response, and this is on

1034
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:01,599
Instagram, says, "Great. I'll believe it

1035
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,559
when I see it. And if it's true, I can't

1036
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,559
wait to get my cut

1037
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:10,000
back." This just kind of [ __ ]

1038
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:12,279
triggers me even more. And there's two

1039
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,920
reasons for it. Number

1040
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,319
one, why is it his

1041
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,838
cut? Because he hooked me up with

1042
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:23,440
somebody and then I did a trade with

1043
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:25,519
them and drove across country and

1044
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,519
somehow it's his cut. And he's talking

1045
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,800
about the skunk, by the way. Okay, which

1046
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:34,039
I grew for I grew it for over two years,

1047
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,119
maybe three years before he ever had it.

1048
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:38,719
And you know, I had it till we both lost

1049
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,800
it to, you know, he didn't have it

1050
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,399
either. I'm I don't know why he didn't

1051
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,519
have it. Maybe cuz he just had a

1052
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:51,599
flowering room, but you know, I you

1053
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:54,639
know, and for me it's like, bro, why are

1054
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,160
you calling me out on Instagram? You

1055
00:45:54,639 --> 00:46:02,039
know, like I'm not calling you out on

1056
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:05,039
Instagram, you know? I I just

1057
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,880
uh I just posted that I gave you

1058
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:09,440
something which you've publicly said a

1059
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,039
million times that I gave it to you.

1060
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,358
take a sip of water and light up my

1061
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:13,358
joint

1062
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:19,838
again. So

1063
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:21,479
anyway, we start sending messages to

1064
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,960
each other

1065
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,559
and it's a super long text thread and

1066
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,440
I'm not going to read it all. However,

1067
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,318
what I will say is anything that I leave

1068
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,639
out, if Jason wants to talk about it or

1069
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:38,159
post it, I'm fine with it. Okay?

1070
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:40,759
because I'm only leaving things out that

1071
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,679
I just feel are redundant and

1072
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,720
excessive on, you know, like it's just

1073
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:49,399
not necessary to make the

1074
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:51,838
point. So, here's some of the

1075
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,240
messages. Gabby, the constant

1076
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,400
questioning me is getting old very fast.

1077
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,479
It's far too timeconuming and seems out

1078
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,318
of touch with what's actually happening.

1079
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,400
You seem traumatized from, I assume,

1080
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,639
your home life. You seem very defensive

1081
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,000
and honestly too easily triggered. It's

1082
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,078
becoming clear that you are looking for

1083
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,559
a sparring partner outside of your home.

1084
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,240
Maybe to take out the frustration. I'm

1085
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,199
sure you're feeling with the treatment

1086
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,199
you're receiving at

1087
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:22,079
home. This comment is so [ __ ] out of

1088
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:24,400
line and like I'm not going to talk

1089
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:28,400
about the [ __ ] like the private [ __ ]

1090
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,800
that he said to me about him, but like

1091
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,400
this is what he's saying. And then when

1092
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,359
he throws that out of left field, like

1093
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,880
we're talking about something completely

1094
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:41,519
different, okay? And then he feels like

1095
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,200
he's got to say that it's just he's just

1096
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:44,960
being an [ __ ] That's just the

1097
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,118
reality. He's just being an [ __ ]

1098
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,960
Says, "If I feel like responding to a

1099
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,800
comment you place on a post from 2017

1100
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,960
about pictures from my garden, then I'll

1101
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,000
do so. If you feel slighted by that,

1102
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,079
then that's something you need to

1103
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,719
address personally. It's just a comment,

1104
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,800
dude. how your feelings got entangled in

1105
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,039
a comment is beyond my understanding.

1106
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,640
I'll say it again. That story is part of

1107
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:10,800
cannabis history. It's been told a dozen

1108
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:13,199
times says, "I see your text about when

1109
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,200
you neglected that clone. I'll never get

1110
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,838
over that. You never even said you were

1111
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,358
sorry. And by reading the text, it

1112
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:21,838
doesn't sound like you even feel that

1113
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,920
way." That's hurtful in ways I'm not

1114
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,519
sure you'll even understand. But yeah,

1115
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,358
let's talk about how a comment triggered

1116
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,358
you. Of course, you never considered

1117
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,358
that making a comment on pictures I took

1118
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:33,759
of the super skunk might open up a bad

1119
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:35,920
memory that absolutely involves you, but

1120
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,240
maybe you should have. Maybe you really

1121
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:43,400
are wrapped up in your own movie so that

1122
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:43,399
you can't see that. Okay, so

1123
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:48,558
um let me respond to that by

1124
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:57,599
saying I did lose this clone. Okay, I

1125
00:48:54,159 --> 00:49:00,598
had a problem at home that I was renting

1126
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,720
and the landlord had to come to fix an

1127
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,200
outlet and so I had to have an

1128
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:07,919
electrician come in and so we got like

1129
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:09,799
you know the plants and I put this plant

1130
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,960
in a cardboard box

1131
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:16,920
outside and it got

1132
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:19,480
fried and I regret it and I'm

1133
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,680
sorry but not to

1134
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:25,440
Jason I'm sorry for myself now also So

1135
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,399
Jason makes it out like I was the only

1136
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,880
person on the universe that had this

1137
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,200
clone. But what about his friends in

1138
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,318
Virginia? What about Greg that I gave it

1139
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,078
to? You know, I mean, I gave it to

1140
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:39,199
Jason. I don't know. Like I said, maybe

1141
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,760
he only had flowering rooms, but um you

1142
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,519
know, I wasn't the only person that had

1143
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,680
this

1144
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:47,599
plant. Okay.

1145
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:50,879
And you know, I don't feel I owe Jason

1146
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:54,880
an apology because I killed one of my

1147
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,440
plants. you know, it sucks and you know,

1148
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,000
I'm happy to talk about it, but like the

1149
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,960
way he was talking about it, you know,

1150
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,159
it's different if I tell the story. When

1151
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,800
he tells the story, he could be like,

1152
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:08,239
"Yeah, that was an unfortunate demise."

1153
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,680
Instead, he calls me out like I'm a

1154
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:15,598
[ __ ] idiot, okay?

1155
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:17,919
And you know, whether I am or not, like

1156
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:22,079
him calling me one publicly like that

1157
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:24,318
was just it was ridiculous. I I said it

1158
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,039
wasn't your story to tell as you said.

1159
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,400
It was you talking [ __ ] about me

1160
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:31,279
publicly. Jason was getting a cut of all

1161
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,920
my sales through Breeders Direct and him

1162
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:38,040
trolling me online like this and keeping

1163
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:42,838
the dog from me for over 6 months.

1164
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:46,480
Like I the way I feel about him, I just

1165
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:48,960
can't be giving him a commission on my

1166
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,000
sales that I do through Breeders Direct.

1167
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,760
And so, you know, I sent Michelle a

1168
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
message privately. I sent it directly to

1169
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,640
her, which is something that I'm not

1170
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,119
allowed to do. Jason only wanted me to

1171
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,440
communicate with Michelle like in a

1172
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,318
group email, you know, in an email

1173
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,599
message that I

1174
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:12,358
um that I CC him in. And this is the

1175
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:15,119
type of controlling person that he is.

1176
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,119
Um I felt like that's a conversation

1177
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,680
that you should have one-on-one. And I

1178
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:25,280
also felt that

1179
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:28,318
um you know it was fine to do it you

1180
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,440
know it's all there in writing you know

1181
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,519
like there's

1182
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,838
nothing nothing weird about it anyway.

1183
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:38,079
So this is where it all comes from. The

1184
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:40,078
proof is by what he says here. He says

1185
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,318
he says I wasn't going to send that but

1186
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,480
then Michelle told me that you didn't

1187
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,159
want to work with me in an email.

1188
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,240
Firstly, talking to my girlfriend before

1189
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:50,159
you speak to me about it is completely

1190
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,078
inappropriate and it was a huge mistake

1191
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,920
on your part. You and I will deal with

1192
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,960
it when I have time. Have a nice

1193
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,318
evening." And then he says, "I don't

1194
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,760
want to talk." And no, I say, "I don't

1195
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:01,920
want to talk to you at all. You want to

1196
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,960
talk about inappropriate? Now you're

1197
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,920
threatening

1198
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,639
me." Jason's response, "Bullshit. That's

1199
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,318
my story to

1200
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:13,920
tell. It's been told. If you don't like

1201
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,079
it, that's something you have to deal

1202
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,318
with personally. Making a big deal about

1203
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,559
that is going to be a big mistake

1204
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:23,279
letting you know. And there's not going

1205
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,680
to be any discussion between you and me

1206
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,800
until I'm

1207
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:30,799
ready. Okay. And um I respond, "Okay, I

1208
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,240
have a good story to tell as well. I can

1209
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,760
tell a story about how you refused to

1210
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:37,199
give me the Chem Dog." Jason's response.

1211
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,160
Does it seem like I care about your

1212
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:43,039
story, Gabby? Now, I want to tell you

1213
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:45,199
that I am skipping some text. There's

1214
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,400
nothing that I have a problem with you

1215
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:50,078
guys knowing. Well, I I should say some

1216
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:55,240
something. Jason says personal [ __ ]

1217
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:58,599
about my family, you know, and like says

1218
00:52:55,239 --> 00:53:01,598
completely inappropriate, inaccurate

1219
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:04,960
comments. So, like, yeah, those I prefer

1220
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,838
not be shared. You know, like I mean if

1221
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,480
if I were to read it to you, you would

1222
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:11,920
think Jason is a complete [ __ ] if

1223
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,240
you're if you're not already thinking

1224
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,480
that. Like who starts bringing up

1225
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:19,439
people's family in a fight that has

1226
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,880
nothing to do with that. Okay? And you

1227
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,119
know what? He's doing it because he has

1228
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,838
no legitimate ground to stand on. He's

1229
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,720
grasping at straws. And that's also why

1230
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:33,039
he's not here to tell his

1231
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:35,039
side. and so skip some texts. So,

1232
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,480
congratulations on opening up a can of

1233
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:39,079
worms that you're not prepared to deal

1234
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,199
with. Good luck with that. Don't text me

1235
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:42,960
anymore. This is what he's saying to me.

1236
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,039
He says, "Oh, don't forget about the

1237
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,920
partner story where you're never even

1238
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:50,480
said I'm sorry for killing the clone."

1239
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,960
And I respond, "Okay, I'm supposed to

1240
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,559
apologize for killing my

1241
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,599
genetics."

1242
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:01,240
Um, right. Get

1243
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:04,720
down. Okay. So

1244
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:08,159
again, like Jason for some reason thinks

1245
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:10,719
I killed his clones, the clones that I

1246
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:15,318
had for years before he ever had it.

1247
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:18,000
Like it was super unfortunate that

1248
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:20,279
um that I didn't take care of those

1249
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,960
plants better. I accept full

1250
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,800
responsibility, but I don't owe Jason,

1251
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,519
sorry, Ray really wants to get in the

1252
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:31,000
picture again. I don't owe Jason an

1253
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:34,880
apology. I just don't

1254
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,920
like like for losing my own genetics. I

1255
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,640
have to apologize to someone else. Okay.

1256
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,159
I said this to Jason. Okay. Said, "I'll

1257
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,838
give you an opportunity. I know you

1258
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,759
won't accept it cuz you're a big man

1259
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,000
only in a small room. We should do a

1260
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,000
podcast together. Both tell our story.

1261
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,679
Start off on the good parts. Then we can

1262
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,199
get to where we are now. And then we can

1263
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,879
let it be judged by the court of public

1264
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:56,239
opinion. You don't think people are

1265
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,640
going to be are going to think you're an

1266
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:01,000
[ __ ] for withholding the dog from me?

1267
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:04,159
I said, 'We can have heavy days

1268
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,760
moderate. Jason's response, I'm not even

1269
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:09,039
remotely interested in doing your

1270
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,480
podcast at this point, dude. I say, no

1271
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,039
problem. I'll tell everyone that I

1272
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,559
invited you, but you were a chicken

1273
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:16,159
[ __ ]

1274
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:18,400
Jason. And so, we skip some stuff here,

1275
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:21,679
right, Jason? So, I showed you gratitude

1276
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,119
by mentioning you your name 10 years

1277
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,199
ago.

1278
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,680
I will tell the story the way it is. I

1279
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,519
tell the

1280
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:31,519
truth that that it deserves. I'm not

1281
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:33,599
your marketing agent. I could care less.

1282
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:35,920
I speak from my heart. And when someone

1283
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,000
brings up a bad memory, I mention it.

1284
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,838
Why are you on a post from 2017 giving

1285
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,639
yourself credit that you're not even

1286
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:44,318
sure if you deserve? You should tell the

1287
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:47,318
world that you're sorry for killing the

1288
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:50,558
super skunk. Comprende,

1289
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:52,558
homeboy, you have a you have a choice

1290
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,319
only cuz I'm giving you one. You can

1291
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,880
either end our friendship or you can

1292
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:58,880
make an enemy. It's up to you. I'm ready

1293
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,039
for either. Don't make the wrong

1294
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,960
decisions,

1295
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:04,960
Gabriel. Then he says after some more

1296
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,400
[ __ ] you actually pissed me off

1297
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:11,119
today. Now I'm your [ __ ] problem. And

1298
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,639
his response is, "Oh, a jester. Oh no.

1299
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,318
That would be you saying I'm sorry for

1300
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,480
killing one of the most legendary clones

1301
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:19,039
you were priv privileged enough to have

1302
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,358
thanks to my [ __ ] efforts and my

1303
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:24,558
friends. But you couldn't do that

1304
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:26,960
yourself. You couldn't do that yourself.

1305
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:29,798
Entitlement stopped you again. Or maybe

1306
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,159
saying that you for allowing my

1307
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:34,960
girlfriend and you to work together for

1308
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:38,078
the last year. Yes. And I kept it alive

1309
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,400
for 30 years. No thanks to you. Lol. Do

1310
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,920
the math, [ __ ] You [ __ ] up. Your

1311
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,358
anger and weird self-entitlement.

1312
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,519
Complete ego egoomaniacal [ __ ] has

1313
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:49,039
brought me to a major problem. Has

1314
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,199
brought a major problem right to your

1315
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,759
door. You made an enemy with your words

1316
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,919
and actions and lack of actions. You

1317
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,079
killed that plant being a lazy larf on

1318
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,798
your

1319
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:04,000
couch. So, first of all, I think I said

1320
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:08,280
this before, I'll say it again. Pretty

1321
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:13,599
awesome that Jason was able to keep the

1322
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:16,160
91 for 30 years. I mean, now I don't

1323
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,440
think he's the only one to do that. You

1324
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:19,838
know, there's people on the East Coast

1325
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:23,358
that have it. You know, some that I can

1326
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:25,519
mention by name, like JJ. Um, maybe they

1327
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:31,039
had it for 20some years. So, the [ __ ]

1328
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:32,798
what? Um, but uh, yeah. So, props to

1329
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,599
Jason for holding on to that clone for

1330
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:39,519
30 years. You know, maybe if he returned

1331
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,359
it to me, I could thank him for it, but,

1332
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:43,679
you know, he doesn't want to give it to

1333
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:47,199
me. Like even when I tried to buy it for

1334
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:49,358
500 bucks, he didn't take my order. So,

1335
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:51,759
I'm not going to thank him for holding a

1336
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,759
plant that I gave him that he's

1337
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,200
withholding from me. And so, like,

1338
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,280
that's just one question I have for you

1339
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,480
guys. Like, how do you feel about the

1340
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,280
fact that I gave the Chem Dog to Jason?

1341
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,960
He talks about how I gave it to him,

1342
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:09,839
taught him how to grow, and he refuses

1343
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,000
to give me this plant back.

1344
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:14,960
The other thing is, and I told him this

1345
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,838
too, because I made a video about the

1346
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,440
Gabby Staten Island sour, this new sour

1347
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:21,759
that I found that I think is super

1348
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,400
awesome. In this video, and you can

1349
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,839
check it out on Instagram. I'll put a

1350
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:30,079
link in the comments. I talk about how I

1351
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,480
I don't know where this clone came from,

1352
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,119
but that I think it's a really great

1353
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:37,838
clone, and I'm going to call it the

1354
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:42,400
Gabby Staten Island Sour Diesel. And

1355
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:44,400
this is all really a joke at Jason and

1356
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,559
not so dog. And so if you guys think I

1357
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,000
have it had it coming, you can let me

1358
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,440
know. Jason didn't seem to be bothered

1359
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,119
about it when I talked to him because I

1360
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:56,079
sent them both the link to the video.

1361
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:58,160
And so first with not dog, the most

1362
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,240
common question I get about the three

1363
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:03,039
sour cuts that I have is, is that the

1364
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,558
not so sour? It's so [ __ ] annoying

1365
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,719
cuz like what the hell is the not so

1366
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,839
sour? It's not like he bred it. It's

1367
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:13,679
just the clone that he's had, you know.

1368
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,798
And the other thing that gets me, and I

1369
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:16,239
I'll be honest with you, it strikes a

1370
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:17,880
nerve with me. You can tell me if I'm

1371
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:22,479
right or wrong,

1372
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:26,400
but Jason calling the Chem Dog the

1373
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,358
Chem91 the VA cut. Like, what makes it

1374
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,680
the VA cut? To be honest, I think it's

1375
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:32,719
disrespectful to Greg. Not to me. I

1376
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:34,480
don't want it to be called the Gabby

1377
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:35,759
cut, you know, cuz that's not what it

1378
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,199
is, you know? You know, and if you want

1379
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,760
to talk about a cut, you can say, "Yeah,

1380
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:41,558
this is the Chem91." The provenence is,

1381
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,160
"I got it from Gabby who got it from

1382
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:46,400
Greg." You know, or other people can

1383
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:48,480
say, "I bought it from Jason who got it

1384
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,440
from Gabby who got it from Greg." That's

1385
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,639
the provenence. But attaching your name

1386
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,200
to a historical clone like

1387
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:59,358
that, it's just super arrogant, you

1388
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:01,439
know? And that combined in the fact that

1389
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:04,078
like he's keeping it from me because

1390
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:07,119
like he feels because he's held it for

1391
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:10,359
30 years like it's like he's the only

1392
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:13,599
one entitled to it, you know?

1393
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:16,400
So, I don't think we should call the 91

1394
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:20,160
the VA cut. I think it's disrespectful

1395
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,480
to Greg and I think it feeds Jason's ego

1396
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:26,318
which is out of

1397
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:28,880
control, you know. And so I uh I made

1398
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:31,679
this joke that I'm calling this clone

1399
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,519
the Gabby Staten Island. Mostly because

1400
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:35,759
I didn't know what else to [ __ ] call

1401
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:37,280
it. I already have two other sour. And

1402
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,119
when I asked the person that I got it

1403
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,240
from what the provenence on it, they're

1404
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,400
like, "I don't know. We just got it from

1405
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:46,479
a grower." So, you

1406
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:49,519
know, like I said in my video, I make it

1407
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,920
clear that calling it that is kind of

1408
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:55,280
just a joke. I'm going to stick with it

1409
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,440
because at this point it's like it is

1410
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,599
what it is and and I tell everyone that

1411
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,358
I'm not taking myself seriously that I

1412
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:04,000
haven't bred it. I haven't even flowered

1413
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:05,759
this plant yet. Okay. I you know my

1414
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,358
buddy flowered it. I've seen the flower

1415
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,359
and I got the clones from the tissue

1416
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:16,199
culture lab that he got them from. Um

1417
01:01:10,358 --> 01:01:19,558
but yeah, it's a [ __ ] joke. And

1418
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:21,960
um anyway, to get back on

1419
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:25,680
track, Jason and

1420
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:27,280
I were not cool, you know. I'm never

1421
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:30,358
going to be cool with this guy again. I

1422
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,760
I can't even see it happening.

1423
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:36,880
Like, you know, and and honestly, I know

1424
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,160
he feels the same way, you know, and I

1425
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,119
don't know what his [ __ ] problem is.

1426
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:44,000
I I just think like he's got his head so

1427
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,880
far up his ass that he can't realize

1428
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,318
when he's being an

1429
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:52,559
[ __ ] you know, like trolling me on

1430
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:54,558
Instagram. Like, you know, if if me

1431
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,760
making a comment on a post, which by the

1432
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,119
way, it's not like I was searching for

1433
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,000
this post. It came on the top of my

1434
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,519
feed. If that triggers him to the point

1435
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,838
where he's going to call me out publicly

1436
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,679
like

1437
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:08,960
that, I I just think that's [ __ ] up,

1438
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:11,358
you know? and I killed the plant there.

1439
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,960
I say it for the record. I apologize to

1440
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:17,199
every one of you except for

1441
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,920
Jason. Yeah. So, that's the story.

1442
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,759
That's why you haven't seen Jason on my

1443
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:24,798
podcast. That's why when you ask me if I

1444
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,599
have the Chem Dog, I, you know, either

1445
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:28,880
say no and dodge it or, you know, like,

1446
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,519
or if you ask me if I'm releasing the

1447
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,480
Chem Dog, I don't say I don't have it. I

1448
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:37,679
just said nothing about it, you know.

1449
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,440
But now you guys all know that, you

1450
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:42,159
know, Jason doesn't want to give me the

1451
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,798
Chem Dog. Now, having said that, another

1452
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:46,480
number of people have stepped up to say

1453
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:49,679
they're going to give it to me. And

1454
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,679
actually, I should point this out. My

1455
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:52,440
feeling is is Jason should just give it

1456
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:54,639
to

1457
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,838
me. You know, like when I asked him for

1458
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:57,679
the Chem Dog, it should be like, "Sure,

1459
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:01,759
Gab, no problem. I'll send you a couple

1460
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:04,000
of them." you know, instead it's like 6

1461
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,920
months of dodging me, you know, and then

1462
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,838
when he eventually releases it to the

1463
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,079
public, he says, "I can have it if I

1464
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:11,920
agree not to sell it for 3 4 months, and

1465
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:15,519
then I agree to only sell it for a price

1466
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,519
that he agrees to when he already broke

1467
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:19,559
his agreement to me when I gave him the

1468
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:21,480
clone." It's just

1469
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:23,480
ridiculous, you know?

1470
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,719
So

1471
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:29,119
anyway, the reason why I made this

1472
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:32,000
podcast is because Jason [ __ ] trolled

1473
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,358
me and then he threatened me. And you

1474
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,639
know, I read you the messages where he's

1475
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:36,719
like, "You're opening up a can of

1476
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:39,279
worms." It's like, and now you got to

1477
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:42,239
deal with my [ __ ] [ __ ] He can um

1478
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,960
say, "I killed a clone." Which I already

1479
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,358
said that I killed the clone. So like,

1480
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,798
there's really nothing that he can say

1481
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:51,038
that's not going to make him look like a

1482
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:54,000
[ __ ] [ __ ] And that's why he

1483
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,640
didn't do this podcast. And that's why

1484
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,880
he's probably not going to [ __ ] say

1485
01:03:55,639 --> 01:04:03,038
anything, you know? And like

1486
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,960
honestly, I'm doing this to document my

1487
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,200
weed

1488
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:10,000
story. Jason being an [ __ ] to me is

1489
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:12,078
an unfortunate part of my weed story. 15

1490
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,719
years from now, I don't want to make the

1491
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:18,640
same mistake with Jason again, you know?

1492
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:21,798
I you know so I think it's important to

1493
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:25,519
document your weed stories good and bad

1494
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:28,400
and you know I'm not here to talk [ __ ]

1495
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:30,480
about other people's you know second and

1496
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,798
third hand this is the [ __ ] that

1497
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,280
happened to me oh I remember what I was

1498
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:41,838
going to say and you know

1499
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:44,480
um people really kiss Jason's ass and a

1500
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,960
lot of people actually try to kiss mine

1501
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,920
And if you've ever contacted me and you

1502
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:53,039
start like thanking me profusely about

1503
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,920
like my involvement with the Chem Dog, I

1504
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,599
always stop you. You know, I always say,

1505
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,280
"Hey, look, I don't think I did that

1506
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:03,680
much. You know, like I drove the plant

1507
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:06,480
across country, you know, I don't have,

1508
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:08,239
you know, like I'm part of the story,

1509
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:12,240
you know, but like the people really

1510
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:14,558
responsible for it is Greg." And you

1511
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,598
know, while Jason deserves props for

1512
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:19,119
keeping a clone for 30

1513
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:22,480
years, doesn't mean like it's his

1514
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:25,200
[ __ ] clone and only his and like

1515
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,119
nobody, you know, other people have it,

1516
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:30,118
you know, same exact [ __ ] clone that

1517
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:32,480
he has, you know,

1518
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:33,880
and you know, I just think the way he

1519
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,719
acts about this

1520
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:39,039
clone, it's

1521
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:42,239
[ __ ] it's beyond materialistic.

1522
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:44,720
It's like he thinks he owns something

1523
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:47,358
that really can't be owned, you know,

1524
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:50,719
and he owns something that was given to

1525
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,719
him, you know,

1526
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:59,280
like Yeah. So, please do not call the

1527
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:01,760
Chem Dog or the 91 the VA cut because

1528
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,920
that's just feeding this guy's ego and

1529
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,680
his ego is already a [ __ ] monster

1530
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,159
balloon.

1531
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:09,960
Anyway, sorry I had to take this podcast

1532
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:13,239
on a

1533
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:18,039
negative spin, but

1534
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:18,038
uh felt it had to be told.

1535
