9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,238
few things today but I think the first

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,440
thing I want to start with is doing a

11
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:43,000
little bit of a response to the Noto dog

12
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:47,920
and crybaby podcast that's on the

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,640

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,680
there was a reason why I had wol here so

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,399

19
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,879

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,560
different shows that they put on there

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,158
and um one of them that they do is the

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,240
NATO dog crybaby podcast which I've been

23
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,320
glued to every week um and you know I

24
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,239
I'm really honored they mention me a lot

25
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,239
on the podcast and I hope that they

26
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,000
invite me to be on the show soon and I'm

27
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,438
trying to get NATO dog to do this

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,118
podcast uh you know do a podcast with me

29
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:33,438
as well because he's part of my story

30
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:36,959
but I did want to get out this response

31
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:40,239
to their latest podcast

32
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,039
where so NATO dog in not the last

33
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,519
podcast but the one before one of the

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,920
things he talks about is how he believes

35
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:54,280
the next set of Elites are going to come

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:57,240
from um hom grows um small farms or

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,640
accidents and you know after the podcast

38
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:03,798
I called him up and let him know that I

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,879
didn't agree with him and so the first

40
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,759
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

41
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:12,239
play a video for you guys of what he

42
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:15,119
said and

43
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,878
um you know then I'm going to respond to

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,319
it um it was actually what crybaby

45
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,799
said and so here's that video Gabby

46
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,759
actually disagreed with me so much he

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,959
like called me up to to tell me about it

48
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,919
um right after the last show or whatever

49
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,878
but I think the next Elites are all

50
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,318
coming from small farms and small and

51
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,159
and garage siiz grows and bedroom grows

52
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:38,280
and and tent grows and stuff because

53
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,878
those people are going to be

54
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,800
specifically looking for what we want

55
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:46,399
right and it's crazy to see someone and

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,680
you know I I like Abby so like but it's

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,158
crazy to see someone who so much of what

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,640
they love is based on absolute random

59
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:58,120
[ __ ] we picked up a [ __ ] bag at

60
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,359
this show and it was dank and we [ __ ]

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,519
and it's all of those things

62
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,000
it's crazy to see someone who's just vly

63
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,640
[ __ ] against the idea that that would

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,598
happen again especially when there's

65
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:16,719
probably some nod to using all of these

66
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:20,000
random happen stance you know lines to

67
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:25,239
make these new [ __ ] Killers so the

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,719
thing that um I wanted to talk about was

69
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,400
crybaby saying and I'm going to read it

70
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,680
here crazy to see someone who's vly

71
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,280
against the idea that this could happen

72
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,480
again meaning that I am vehemently

73
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,878
against the idea that um the next Elite

74
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,318
strain would come

75
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:48,280
from um a hom grow or a small

76
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:50,679
farm and that's just not the way I feel

77
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,000
at all you know I called NATO dog and I

78
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,920
told him that I wasn't so sure that

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,719
that's where it would come from and you

80
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,078
know I'm going to talk about why in a

81
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,239
minute but you know I think the first

82
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:10,560
thing that I'd like to discuss before we

83
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:13,560
even go there is what is an elite strain

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,319
how do we Define an elite strain and

85
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,839
also what is a strain of historical um

86
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:23,079
significance so let's start with wolf

87
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,039
why don't you tell me uh what you what

88
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:29,279
how you would define an elite

89
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,600
strin yeah so I think that I'll start

90
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,559
off first by talking about the uh like

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,240
the history of the elite strains I guess

92
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,600
or what what that's meant in the past

93
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,800
and so I would like the first ones that

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:46,039
come to mind would be things like OG

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,319
kush or chem dog or um like Girl Scout

96
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:51,719
cookies or anything that kind of Hit the

97
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,360
market uh with a like a splash almost

98
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,639
like something that really made waves

99
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,520
with people and um like if somebody had

100
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,079
that when they were coming to the the

101
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,639
smoke sesh then they were the one that

102
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,599
everyone was kind of like oh they have

103
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,360
that they have that new stuff or that

104
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,879
that's something special and it's not

105
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,720
just you know whatever the the green

106
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,519
stuff was or the purple stuff was that

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,360
you would get the the No Name like it's

108
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,918
just you got option A or option b

109
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,720
typically whenever I

110
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,240
was um like purchasing anything back in

111
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,759
the

112
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,800
day and then uh so then what do I think

113
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,120
uh like the future of Elites are so

114
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,759
again I think that it does really come

115
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,959
down

116
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,360
to what people

117
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,279
[Music]

118
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,120
are like what people are looking for um

119
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,839
and I think that sometimes when people

120
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,680
will say like oh uh the elites

121
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:50,399
are whatever sells the most I I don't

122
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,280
know I I think that it's really area

123
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:56,159
dependent and it's just considering the

124
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,439
use of social media now and how

125
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,479
information can travel it's going to be

126
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,079
whatever has the the best almost

127
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,038
uh

128
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:08,439
marketing that's what's going to be the

129
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,918
elite because it's sad but it doesn't

130
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,719
matter if it yields well or if its

131
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,799
potency uh you know is across the board

132
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,520
for everyone's endoc canabo system or

133
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,680
even if the tur profile is crazy yeah no

134
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,079
it doesn't I mean like as long as it I

135
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,120
feel like one of the biggest things is

136
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,519
it has to be glamorous you know it has

137
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,560
to be something that's very photogenic

138
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:33,159
and

139
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,839
very nice to look at uh with with like

140
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,960
the smoking end of it kind of being

141
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:41,079
secondary almost to what looks good um

142
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,038
but I mean there are still there's a lot

143
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:46,120
that's that looks good and smokes good

144
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,399
and grows really well and for me like as

145
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,840
a cultivator the elites are the ones

146
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,598
that grow well yield well and have easy

147
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,000
trimming because trimming is just one of

148
00:06:54,598 --> 00:07:00,199
the biggest expenses for a um like for

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
each pound that you produce trimming is

150
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,800
going to be a significant percentage

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,439
then it's going to be labor labor and

152
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,000
trimming are pretty much even neck to

153
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:12,160
neck in terms of the the cost per pound

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,639
and then you know organic or synthetic

155
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,800
after that is kind of set like tertiary

156
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,240
almost to the those two Front Runners in

157
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,800
terms of price per what your uh

158
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,800
production unit is so in the end I feel

159
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,038
like the elites are going to be the ones

160
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,879
that can continue with this downturned

161
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,439
Market to be able to make people

162
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,919
profitable well before I let tosmic

163
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:42,839
chime in um prior to those strains there

164
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:44,598
was Panama Red Colombian gold and and

165
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,439
ttic those would have never been

166
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,959
referred to as Elites at the time though

167
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,478
Elites is only something that's a

168
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,519
current term those would have just been

169
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:55,279
what's

170
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:57,399
available right but what made that um

171
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,079
and I don't want to give up too too much

172
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:04,758
of what I think but there was you know

173
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:07,038
also marketing right that stuff became

174
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,400
something that people heard of and and

175
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,759
wanted you know like everybody wanted

176
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,478
the Panama Red of the Colombian gold or

177
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,879
or the tie stick because the word got

178
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,680
out for sure that that's that's part of

179
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,120
it so go ahead Cosmic I want to hear

180
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,879
what you got to say as well as your

181
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,079
kitty he keeps attacking me so yeah if I

182
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,879
look off screen that's what's happening

183
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,758
I'm trying to sh I always kind of viewed

184
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,278
like the strains especially before or

185
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,399
you know um legalization happened you

186
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,958
know recreational or even medical is you

187
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,639
know people didn't necessarily know the

188
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,478
Growers or even there wasn't necessarily

189
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:44,679
any Brands around you know really what

190
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,720
the brand was was the strain name and I

191
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,559
think a driving force between you know

192
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,759
behind the popularity not just you know

193
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,719
the potency and the tpin and everything

194
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,559
like that but is how much profit it

195
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,278
could bring the grower when they um

196
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,759
decided to grow that particular cut

197
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,278
because again they were breaking a lot

198
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,159
of laws you know there was a lot of risk

199
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,919
involved and so they're not going to be

200
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,480
wasting any time with strains that don't

201
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,439
produce a lot or you know wolf as you

202
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,360
said are you know taking a lot of time

203
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,399
to trim they're labor intensive you know

204
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,879
you're losing a lot of weight that way

205
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,958
so I think that the you know um our

206
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,000
original strains that we know very very

207
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,199
well you know like white widow or bub

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,958
kush or you know any of those kind of um

209
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,920
Elite strains it's because they were

210
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,078
really profitable for the the grower to

211
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:35,078
risk you know um any kind of jail time

212
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:37,639
or any kind of um you know um anything

213
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:38,879
that happened that way so it does have

214
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,759
to do with you know the brand

215
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,240
recognition or you know the strain you

216
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,559
know because that's what the people know

217
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,360
oh you know um I want to get some AK-47

218
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,359
or train wreck or you know whatever it

219
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,919
is um but it also has to do with how

220
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,120
good of a cultivator it was for the

221
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:58,078
grower for sure I point wholeheartedly

222
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,799
with that because it's like the like

223
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:03,519
Elite is uh it has to be tied with the

224
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,519
capitalistic nature of the the market

225
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,839
like you have you can only have an elite

226
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,399
strain if it makes you money otherwise

227
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,000
it by all other metrics it's not it's

228
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,559
not going to meet any of the bars

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,720
required to make it Elite um if it

230
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,359
doesn't produce well enough for uh for

231
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,639
profitability yeah I I think both of you

232
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:29,000
guys make really good points

233
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:32,360
because um you know while some people

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,679
may hate to hear this you know it's kind

235
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,720
of what you said if a strain

236
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:42,319
isn't profitable if if if it doesn't

237
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,680
make Financial sense then you know

238
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,360
people aren't going to grow as much of

239
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,638
it and then it's not going to get out

240
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,919
there and it's you know it can never

241
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,879
reach that Elite status you know

242
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:56,479
something that's a little bit contrary

243
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:59,320
to this is actually the chem dog and

244
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,399
something that you know NATO dog does

245
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,600
doesn't really mention in his podcasts

246
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,958
is we grew a very limited amount of chem

247
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:12,360
dog and the reason why is it didn't

248
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:16,000
produce as well as the skunk you know or

249
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,480
other strains that we grew and you know

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,600
it's actually surprising or it it maybe

251
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,600
it took more time and effort for it to

252
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,519
reach that status of an elite strain

253
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,920
because not that many people got their

254
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,839
hands on it you know and

255
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,919
you

256
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:37,600
know I'm going to get to what my

257
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:41,639
definition is of of an elite strain but

258
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,800
one thing in Elite strain is not is what

259
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,879
you or I think is the best right it it's

260
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:53,399
not like well I think this strain is the

261
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:58,879
best it's elite right that is um that's

262
00:11:53,399 --> 00:12:03,600
just someone's opinion right um to me

263
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:05,720
what makes a strain Elite is when it has

264
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,680
when there's a large market for

265
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:14,199
it and it

266
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:17,399
lasts okay it has staying power okay um

267
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:19,000
so you know for instance probably the

268
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,000
most elite

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,078
strain in my lifetime would be the sour

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,399
diesel okay because that strain was

271
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,278
grown for the longest time by the most

272
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,839
amount of people

273
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:35,958
okay and had the highest demand and

274
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:39,959
actually still today it has a high

275
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:43,119
demand and another thing that that I

276
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:47,159
think goes into play is for instance if

277
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,720
you ask random people on the street do

278
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,039
they know the sour diesel most people

279
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,160
even if they don't smoke weed they

280
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:56,439
probably have heard of the sour diesel

281
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,399
hem dog not so much I think run would

282
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,600
beat it out nowadays though

283
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,679
out of people that actually smoke but

284
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,399
yeah but the the other thing about that

285
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:09,919
is that runs is a more it's more modern

286
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,440
right so it's fresher in people's mind

287
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,519
but that was something that I was going

288
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,760
to move on to a little bit later is I

289
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:21,720
think while it's extremely controversial

290
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:25,879
to say this and particularly in craft

291
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,959
cannabis um in our group on Reddit and

292
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,759
uh Discord a lot of people would be

293
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:35,439
offended that that I would say this but

294
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:38,879
Lemon Cherry gelato and runs are Elite

295
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,000
strains they are right you know those

296
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,919
strains get so much hate right people

297
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,639
like uh you know doesn't get me high all

298
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,838
this weed all tastes the same because

299
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,440
it's a million in one crosses with

300
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,440
gelato and

301
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,199
runs it's true like and and I think it's

302
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,440
a big mistake that breeders are doing

303
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,919
today is just crossing these strains and

304
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,519
a lot of the Canabis is becoming very

305
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:07,120
similar but you can't deny a couple of

306
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:10,519
things number one Lemon Cherry gelato is

307
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,600
pretty weed photogenic you know it's

308
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:17,720
photogenic has a great nose Okay um

309
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,199
maybe it doesn't get me as high as other

310
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,959
strains like OG but for the average

311
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:28,519
consumer that [ __ ] gets them high right

312
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:31,000
and you know Lemon Cherry gelato if

313
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,720
you're a cult cator you can sell more

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,360
Lemon Cherry gelato or runs than

315
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,360
anything else that you grow okay I don't

316
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,440
care how fire your OG is today but you

317
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,199
can't sell it like you can sell packs of

318
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,120
Lemon Cherry gelato so your weekend

319
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,319
Warriors OG Kush is too strong like

320
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,839
exactly you know that's what I was

321
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,360
saying like the majority of the people

322
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,959
don't require something that's much more

323
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,039
poent you know so like I said I think

324
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,239
it's controversial to say but Lemon

325
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:02,838
Cherry gelato and r

326
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,399
those are the Elite strains of today you

327
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,920
know that that's what I think I I don't

328
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,000
think you'll find any controversy in

329
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:11,679
this in this group right here like maybe

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,278
I didn't get maybe I didn't get a wide

331
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,439
enough panel right because I'm not

332
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,879
looking for like we were talking before

333
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,920
the show I'm not looking to just have

334
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:24,559
people on that agree with me but um I

335
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,919
think there just a lot ofter of it an

336
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,399
opposing opinion because I feel like we

337
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:32,198
see this a lot within our the uh craft

338
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,639
marijuana Reddit so um people I think

339
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:36,000
hate on strains that they don't have

340
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:38,680
access to and I think that it's about a

341
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,958
status symbol because of how much status

342
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:42,318
matters to people in general so when you

343
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,239
don't have access to something that

344
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:47,399
other people have access to you feel as

345
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,318
though you're not you're not at that

346
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,519
level uh and and to grow something that

347
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:55,958
is an elite cut within the commercial

348
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,560
side of things is to grow something that

349
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:02,159
is like runs Lemon Cherry gelato

350
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,439
um God there's there's just too many now

351
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,078
like uh just because we talked about

352
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,040
those I'm think I'm blinking on so many

353
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,120
more but there's like so all the candy

354
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,198
strains but yeah any any candy strain

355
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,399
anything that is like a cookie strain or

356
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:17,318
anything that's like a stizzy strain or

357
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,600
anything that's like uh a preferred

358
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,399
Garden strain or something that is like

359
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,079
one of these larger brand names that

360
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,958
people can find in a dispensary but then

361
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,318
they go oh I want to grow at home so

362
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,278
what do they do they buy seeds typically

363
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:32,399
and they don't understand that the pheno

364
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:34,399
selecting process of these different

365
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,559
Elite cultivars requires the pheno

366
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,679
hunting of hundreds if not thousands of

367
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,198
different seeds and so they go well this

368
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,799
isn't what I wanted and it doesn't look

369
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:46,719
as good as that well screw those guys

370
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,240
they they must have some secret thing

371
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,040
that they're keeping from me and it's

372
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,000
like it's just the cultivar uh and

373
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,519
cultivar meaning specifically like a

374
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,600
tried and true tested U production crop

375
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:03,318
like um not a seed is not a cult

376
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,558
a a clone is a cultivar so when you when

377
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,038
you have people that don't have access

378
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,318
to these things I do feel as though

379
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,919
there is a little bit of stigma that's

380
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:13,639
raised where they say oh well you know I

381
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,600
think Girl Scout cookies has gotten the

382
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,079
most hate where everyone say Oh Girl

383
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,958
Scout cookies or cookies is it's not

384
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,558
it's

385
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,679
not but it's it got such good

386
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:27,519
recognition because if you smoked

387
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,600
cookies in like 2009 that was the best

388
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,918
cannabis you've smoked in a decade

389
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,879
because it was smooth and flavorful and

390
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:39,000
it wasn't crazy racy high like super

391
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,360
silver haze or headband or something

392
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,759
where you were like smoking that and you

393
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,639
were just not functional for part of the

394
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:46,319
day but you could like smoke it with

395
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,600
your friends you could be social it

396
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,319
tasted good it looked good and like I

397
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,519
don't know that that's what an elite

398
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,158
cult guard to me is and when when people

399
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,798
get frustrated at the fact that they

400
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,520
don't have access to it I feel like

401
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:03,119
that's when it starts to have this

402
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:06,879
uh hate towards it I don't know about

403
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:11,000
that um you know again it's good that we

404
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,480
don't agree on everything uh examples of

405
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,679
of why I don't believe or agree with

406
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,159
that uh one clear one would be the chem

407
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:23,320
dog right almost no one has it and I

408
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,240
never see any hate I've yet to see one

409
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:28,038
person say oh the chem dog is

410
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,279
met wasn't buil on it that that's where

411
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:34,480
the of course it was comes in an empire

412
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:37,720
was built on it not maybe not not as big

413
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,519
not as big as you know the the cookies

414
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,240
crew or jungle boys all these different

415
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,119
people though but that's where the it's

416
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,120
just those guys are

417
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,279
big it's hating on the big

418
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:54,798
guys succeeded in in using those Elite

419
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:58,879
cuts to be successful well I mean I kind

420
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:01,519
of agree with people saying that maybe

421
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,440
they're bored of the Lemon Cherry gelato

422
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,519
you know because there's so much stuff

423
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,159
that's similar um although if there was

424
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,400
10 different strains that were all

425
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,280
similar to the chem dog I'd be in heaven

426
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,400
right now right but I mean GMO is my

427
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,678
favorites me too you know I'm smoking we

428
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,280
were going to talk about what we're

429
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,798
smoking this is some GMO sauce turps

430
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,399
that's what I what I can what I consume

431
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,918
so um we want to do a little talk about

432
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,480
what are we smoking I don't want want to

433
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,038
get too far off the

434
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,880
subject nice what's that animal

435
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:39,519
tsunami oh

436
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,360
sweet um I want to

437
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:47,279
finish uh my thought process on and my

438
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,959
response to the NATA dog crybaby podcast

439
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,519
and then we can go off on as far of a

440
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,120
tangent as we go but I just want to make

441
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:57,200
sure I don't forget what the purpose of

442
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:59,158
of me recording this today was

443
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,720
so my thoughts

444
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:07,559
on why the next Elites aren't going to

445
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,880
come from or are less likely to I

446
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:14,678
certainly do not vehemently oppose the

447
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:18,360
idea that the next Elite could come from

448
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:21,440
a hom grower or a small breeder um

449
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,399
but I think you know what we had to do

450
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,440
and I think we begun to do it was Define

451
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,600
what is an elite strain and so for me an

452
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:35,120
elite strain is a strain that has a

453
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:39,158
large market demand and Lasting time

454
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:41,918
right and so you know back in the day

455
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,360
the only way that we got new genetics

456
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,000
were from these accidents or from small

457
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:49,399
briers or a seed that somebody gave them

458
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,720
that they had held on to for 20 years

459
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:56,240
and somehow popped you know that was the

460
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:59,558
only way new stuff happened today we

461
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,319
have many breeders including Cosmic and

462
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:05,639
I and I'm not sure if wolf does breeding

463
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:11,038
but um you know you know we have a lot

464
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:16,440
of people that are trying hard to make

465
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:20,359
new generics right so to me I think

466
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,240
that you know hard work pays off and

467
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:26,158
saying that the next Elites are all

468
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,880
going to come from accidents or you know

469
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,600
small Growers that find the seed

470
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,640
somewhere

471
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,399
I just don't think it's as likely today

472
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,480
because of how many people are putting

473
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,320
the work in the other thing is is and

474
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,919
and we talked about it before is how the

475
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:44,439
strains get

476
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,840
marketed

477
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:51,159
okay in order to get the wide market

478
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,480
demand okay and the lasting power you

479
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,480
have to have marketing behind it and

480
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,558
while it's

481
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,120
unfortunate these big

482
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:03,278
companies that's what they do I mean

483
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:05,639
cookies is a marketing company right and

484
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,880
you know they did a good job of

485
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,440
marketing and that's why you know at

486
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,278
least you know the original

487
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,320
cookies

488
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:20,519
has you know in my opinion that is um an

489
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,918
elite strain with historical

490
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:25,000
significance I I think that's the first

491
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,640
question that you have to answer when

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,519
you say when's where's the next Elite

493
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,919
going to come from well what is an elite

494
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:36,158
strain so I told you what it means to me

495
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:39,640
um I think Nick and Cosmic um also did

496
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,039
it but I asked on my Instagram page and

497
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,720
I also asked in our craft group and so I

498
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:46,640
want to read you some of the responses

499
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,880
because most of them it's exactly how I

500
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,600
feel so and I'm not going to read you

501
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,799
their handles I'm just going to read the

502
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,599
comments so most likely a personal

503
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:57,918
cultivator that finds something by

504
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,119
accident but sells early on for a big

505
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,480
price tag

506
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,278
Elite strains are Elite due to their

507
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,440
being passed only to the most trusted

508
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:07,079
friends Growers with the condition that

509
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,880
the plant does not get distributed

510
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,278
indiscriminately this could basically

511
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,000
render Elite strains defunct terms since

512
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:15,919
the market could make the equivalent of

513
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,640
yesterday's 10K Cuts available to at

514
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,600
least a th000 Growers at $10 per cut

515
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,240
with little to zero legal issues here it

516
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:26,038
says in my opinion true actual Elites

517
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,919
meaning high quality not value hype will

518
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,359
be

519
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,880
accidents um like they have always been

520
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,879
and then judged and held by the

521
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,039
community so so far we got a couple of

522
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,640
people that believe that small Growers

523
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:43,640
an ACD but uh this is more of what I

524
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,720
believe let's go here the era has come

525
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,240
to a close strains no longer rise to the

526
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,120
top due to flavor and effects they they

527
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,720
likely used to The Growers used to grow

528
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:56,439
what the people demanded now strains

529
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,400
become popular through marketing and low

530
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,440
cost per pound production

531
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,960
okay

532
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,840
um honestly I think the next big strains

533
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,159
will come from breeders who are Market

534
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,119
aggressive and get the hype train

535
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,159
rolling hard from Instagram accounts

536
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:15,199
with a lot of followers sad but

537
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,720
true and

538
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,038
then um let's

539
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,759
see I'm sure hobby Growers find them but

540
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:26,319
don't have the following to get them out

541
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,599
there then someone says I think like

542
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,918
that person said I think hom grow is

543
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,678
going to find something and he's going

544
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,320
to sell a cut to somebody who does have

545
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,600
a following and they're going to claim

546
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,599
it's

547
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:43,240
theirs um I've got a few bag seeds for

548
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:45,918
the win hobby Growers rule but you know

549
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,720
in the end I think what's going to do it

550
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:53,440
is the marketing so if a small hom

551
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,440
grower were to toate or find the next

552
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,038
Elite

553
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:01,240
strain you know probably his best path

554
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,158
to get it done would be to team up with

555
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,038
somebody that's got the marketing behind

556
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,000
it you know

557
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:12,038
so um

558
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,640
and yeah I guess I want to just finish

559
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:17,158
this by saying

560
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:20,880
discussion I'm certainly not vly opposed

561
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:23,679
to the idea that um the next uh you know

562
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,159
big hit in cannabis could be an accident

563
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,919
or something that's found by a homeg

564
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,880
grower or or bred by a small farm I hope

565
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:35,840
that's what happens and part of me

566
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,840
making this podcast um is to encourage

567
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,759
everyone to grow you know and I think

568
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:45,439
everyone should grow I think everyone

569
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:47,919
should save seeds I think um if people

570
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,919
are interested in it you know doing some

571
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,759
breeding you know and pheno hunting this

572
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:57,000
is all extremely personally rewarding to

573
00:25:54,759 --> 00:26:00,440
the people that are doing it and I I

574
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,798
think it's a great idea so uh you know

575
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,480
to be honest I didn't like the the

576
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:09,558
way my opinion was described you know I

577
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,240
just felt like it made it sound like I'm

578
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:14,678
all for corporate cannabis and that I

579
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,919
think that corporate cannabis rules and

580
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,559
and they're the ones that are going to

581
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,520
make the best weed moving forward

582
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,000
and I think logically it makes sense

583
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,000
when you think about your average person

584
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,759
now especially in states where you know

585
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,038
uh recreational is legal you know

586
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,079
they're not going to going to you know

587
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:33,640
someone's cousin who has you know who

588
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,038
has some some nugs or something they're

589
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,320
going to be going and finding you know a

590
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,599
actual legal uh establishment to make

591
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:43,319
their purchases at and the you know the

592
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,879
products that they offer are coming from

593
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,240
those corporate cannabis you know

594
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,960
companies so I mean

595
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,839
it's it's really honestly they do have a

596
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,480
lot of power there because you know

597
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:57,480
they're already getting their products

598
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:01,960
out and for example when you know um the

599
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,200
location near me Mr Nice Guy um I I

600
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,079
think I went in there you know before a

601
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,440
flight one time and I was talking to one

602
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:09,119
of the bud tenders and I mentioned I was

603
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,480
going you know to a place in Oregon and

604
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,719
they're like oh well why don't you go

605
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,919
check out one of our locations there so

606
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,519
when you think about that you know a lot

607
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,200
of times those companies are going to be

608
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,558
dealing with the you know same

609
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,960
Distributors you know so if that

610
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:24,480
distributor gets you know a cut of

611
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,480
something then you know their ability to

612
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,120
get it out to a wide variety of people

613
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,038
and get that name recognition is

614
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,798
it's way more powerful than you know

615
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:33,839
just someone who's you know selling buds

616
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,359
out of their

617
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,480
house it makes me think of the idea of

618
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:41,199
marketing being exposure where if if

619
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,440
you're exposed to something that's the

620
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,399
best way to market for it and so like

621
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,960
yeah any any any legally compliant area

622
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:51,959
that also has uh multi-state operators

623
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,278
in it are going to have the best

624
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,759
marketing and those are already kind of

625
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,558
painted in black and white we know

626
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,038
exactly which companies those are and

627
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,960
exactly what sort of flower they produce

628
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:06,000
and who they Market towards and so those

629
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,440
are how we're going to see them like

630
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,558
that's that's where the elite cuts are

631
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,720
like it's just within within that

632
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:14,720
category but it doesn't I don't believe

633
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,600
that it means though that the only Elite

634
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,200
strains are going to come from those

635
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:19,959
companies I think they're going to be

636
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,360
marketed by those companies and that's

637
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,840
where the popularity is going to come

638
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,398
from but I don't think that they're the

639
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:28,798
ones that are finding them absolutely

640
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,119
yeah well I mean

641
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,960
I think there's a a good chance of

642
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:37,439
either right um I think that if you know

643
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,440
a small grower finds the next great

644
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,679
strain their best route is to take it to

645
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,360
um a bigger company with marketing but

646
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,120
like we said before there are a lot of

647
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:50,158
people out there today trying to do good

648
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,518
work in

649
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:58,120
breeding

650
00:28:52,519 --> 00:29:00,839
and to me the idea that an accident or

651
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:06,558
somebody with far less experience you

652
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:08,079
know um with with also a lot smaller

653
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:12,759
library of

654
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:15,398
genetics is likely to produce the next

655
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:17,240
Elite I just think it's less likely when

656
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:20,119
we found the chem dog and the sour

657
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,359
diesel and all these other strains there

658
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:24,918
was no corporate cannabis in the United

659
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:30,119
States you know even when we were living

660
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:32,159
under 2115 it was still all you know

661
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:35,558
non-commercial in the sense of like it

662
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,919
wasn't a company there's you know so

663
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:40,158
right you know there there was no Brands

664
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:46,159
so

665
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:48,640
um I just think that it's naive to think

666
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,240
that just because a homeg grower or a

667
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,200
small grower cares more that they're

668
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,839
going to be able to do something more

669
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,000
than what a company with

670
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,359
resources you you know so and we got to

671
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,679
remember too all three of us are

672
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,199
enthusiasts you know your average person

673
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,278
who likes to smoke a joint every now and

674
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,640
then you know they're not going to be

675
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:10,359
able to keep with those names hell I

676
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,720
mean even someone who's in the community

677
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,839
it's it's tough to keep up with all

678
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,679
these different strains that are coming

679
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:16,879
out all the time you know so there

680
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,320
weren't as many strains back in the day

681
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,760
no there really

682
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,158
wasn't I mean I honestly think that the

683
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,679
best strains are going to come from

684
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,559
people with

685
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,000
the with the drive to want to create

686
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,000
something better uh or something

687
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,359
something different or something unique

688
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,720
that also then have the resources and

689
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:37,278
understanding of how to do that at a

690
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,240
small scale to keep it very much uh

691
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,480
focalized upon what their goals are and

692
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,960
so like someone that makes me think of

693
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,440
that it would be like Cosmic because you

694
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,120
have the ability to tissue culture all

695
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,399
of these different strains that you're

696
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,439
bringing in so that you can have a vast

697
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:55,000
genetic library and a very small

698
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,038
footprint with a very limited resource

699
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,038
draw that you can then tap into it any

700
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,480
time to try and pull flavor profiles out

701
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:05,359
of to incorporate into the next wave of

702
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,679
new genetics also with tissue culture

703
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:13,119
you have the ability to Shell pheno

704
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:16,000
hunting projects um without interrupting

705
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,479
other projects you can kind of just slip

706
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,359
in feno Hunts anywhere you want and have

707
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,440
the backups ready to go and ready to

708
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:27,359
call um depending on how your process

709
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,399
goes and it's going to be uh I feel like

710
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,719
any company you know or any individual

711
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:33,359
or any group that has the ability to do

712
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,159
tissue culture is going to be one of the

713
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:39,038
very big parts of the future of elite

714
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,000
genetic selection just because of the

715
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:44,440
overhead reduction because pheno hunting

716
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,960
at commercial scale is ridiculously

717
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,798
expensive and that's also one of the

718
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,038
reasons why I don't think that the

719
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,960
commercial industry actually has the

720
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:55,599
resources to produce all of the elite

721
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,919
genetics I think that they will find

722
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:02,000
some in the pheno Hunts that they do but

723
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,880
to do a 100 light feno hunt like so if

724
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,480
you're going to then try to sell packs

725
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:11,200
out of that to pay for the overhead of

726
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:14,159
that run you you need you need a miracle

727
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,558
of a buyer to be able to take that many

728
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,679
different looking packs um as well as

729
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:20,319
like some of it's just not going to

730
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:23,559
produce and you have to be able to have

731
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:26,839
that factored in and so you know like

732
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:29,759
the the cost of running a 100 light

733
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:33,798
facility or 100 light room for that

734
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:36,000
matter is going to be in a lot of cases

735
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:37,599
if you don't have enough to cover that

736
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,278
overhead you're not going to be able to

737
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:43,480
turn on the electricity the following

738
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:45,679
month it's it's that that much cost so

739
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,120
when a homeg grower who's a hobbyist has

740
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,120
the ability to feno hunt 20 or 50 seeds

741
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:53,678
at a time and do that four or five times

742
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:55,359
a year uh I mean regardless of how long

743
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,919
the actual total fenal hunt and

744
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,719
selection process takes that person's

745
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,440
putting in a lot more work for a lot

746
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,240
less money than some of these commercial

747
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,038
cultivators and if they have the ability

748
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,159
to tissue culture it on their own then

749
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:10,000
that person's a game changer in and of

750
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,720
themselves they can make waves by

751
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,079
themselves as long as they have Partners

752
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,038
within the commercial space that they

753
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:17,839
can then get the um their genetics into

754
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:21,240
the hands of so that it can reach a

755
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:25,240
larger um a larger

756
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:28,759
Community you know I think that

757
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,000
um Cosmic is kind of

758
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:34,599
like he's

759
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,038
the he's he's an exception to the rule

760
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:38,798
at least at least for today and the

761
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,679
reason for it is like you said he's

762
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:45,038
doing the tissue culture but he's still

763
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:50,320
you know working on a fairly small scale

764
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:54,000
and you know most um people will be and

765
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:55,759
you know what me including me are little

766
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,720
intimidated by the idea of tissue

767
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,638
culture you know can send it to you

768
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,600
it'll it'll walk you through the whole

769
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:07,158
thing I've done nodal tissue

770
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:09,358
culture I used to or no sorry marem is

771
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,200
the hardest Nole Nole is the hardest but

772
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,559
Nole is great because then you can proof

773
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,598
things out you can make sure that you

774
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,000
have clean and healthy genetics to start

775
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:20,599
with and you don't have to put a lot of

776
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,239
money and time into it yeah so honestly

777
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,800
isn't that isn't that tough you know

778
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:28,398
um the hardest part is getting equipment

779
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,280
because of how expensive it is yeah it's

780
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:35,878
exciting and you know you're not

781
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:39,240
gonna you know I think and you know Nick

782
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:42,598
can uh chime in I think it's just like

783
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:45,799
in any part of growing or even I know

784
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,559
you're a musician like you keep

785
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,200
learning right so like I'm never going

786
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:54,119
to stop learning about

787
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,158
cultivating and you know I'm never going

788
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,280
to you know you're never going to stop

789
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,320
learning about tissue culture there's

790
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,480
always going to be things left to learn

791
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,079
y right so and you know what I say is

792
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,838
the day you've got nothing left to learn

793
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,240
you know you might as well leave this

794
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,440
earth you know life life is pretty

795
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,598
boring you know for those that think

796
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,519
that they know everything never be the

797
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:20,760
smartest person in the

798
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:23,559
room I mean sometimes you are but it's

799
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,160
unfortunate yeah but don't choose to be

800
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:27,759
right exactly you don't choose to be you

801
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,279
know it's it's funny because like we

802
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,920
started this whole conversation right

803
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,960
talking about Elite genetics and where

804
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,280
those are going to come from and it

805
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,199
seems as though to me like the elite

806
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,079
genetics are going to come from groups

807
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,879
of people having conversations like

808
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:45,359
these because you have to be able to

809
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:48,480
have the intelligence to produce Elite

810
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:51,920
flow in order to determine if it's an

811
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,760
elite cultivar and so without the

812
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,240
ability to understand all these

813
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,960
different processes how are you going to

814
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:58,679
make an educated choice on your

815
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,280
cultivation techniques that produced

816
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:03,919
that time and time again well you know

817
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,319
in the past it was

818
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,599
accidents you know like and you know

819
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:13,358
happy accidents are great you know

820
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:15,000
people win the lottery sometimes you

821
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,239
know but if you're counting on winning

822
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the lottery as as you know you're plan

823
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:25,639
to for the future that's just you know

824
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,719
and

825
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:32,879
yeah I believe that that finding the

826
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:35,239
next Elite strain is

827
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,119
work it's you know that's just the way I

828
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:41,559
see it I I see it's work

829
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:46,039
and you know I hope the next Elite

830
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:49,639
strain is what my pallet and my head

831
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:53,279
thinks is an elite strain right

832
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:55,400
but I'm different than most people you

833
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,720
know and you know this is something that

834
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,160
NATO dog was talking about and you know

835
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:01,559
since we've gone this long already I

836
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,598
want to make sure that I

837
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:08,199
say I love their podcast I love them I

838
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,200
don't think that they meant anything at

839
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:15,759
all by the way

840
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:17,358
they Mis misook my opinion on the matter

841
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,240
right

842
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,679
um I

843
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:26,358
think I think it's a great thing for

844
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:29,480
people to experiment with cannabis like

845
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:34,400
you know and to keep learning breeding

846
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:38,240
is a is a really awesome thing to do but

847
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:42,200
it it's just more work than the average

848
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:45,118
hobbyist is capable of

849
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:46,078
to search through everything to to find

850
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,960
that

851
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,119
Elite you know I

852
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,679
mean like I said back in the day that's

853
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:58,280
all we had you know like uh NATO dog

854
00:37:54,679 --> 00:38:00,759
tells the story about how he got the

855
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,760
meno perss

856
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,680
from

857
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,960
he he met a cancer patient and he gave

858
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:11,879
him some

859
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:15,599
weat and the cancer patient gave him

860
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,880
some seeds that he had for like 20 years

861
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,119
or something

862
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:24,440
and um

863
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,960
when uh Francis grew it and show him the

864
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,119
showed him the weed it turned out it

865
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,838
wasn't even the same thing the guy

866
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,160
thought he was giving him turned out to

867
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:36,480
be something completely different but

868
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:39,318
um you know I think those days are just

869
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,920
gone like those stories I I think are

870
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:45,039
less likely

871
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:48,079
like you know unfortunately I have SE I

872
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:49,719
have seat 20 years old what' you say

873
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,200
what about the super boo cut I feel like

874
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:55,838
that's a great uh contemporary story

875
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:59,879
that's very similar to that so my answer

876
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:03,519
to that is I love the super boo I'm not

877
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,680
I don't know the story um the name is

878
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:11,639
one of the worst names in cannabis

879
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:14,559
history um but I love the weed I have um

880
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,318
I know people that that tried growing it

881
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:21,000
on a commercial scale

882
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:25,719
here it to me it checks every box okay

883
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:29,838
Strong Nose good high looks great yields

884
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:33,118
great this strange should be an

885
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:35,078
elite people hate it out here nobody

886
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,800
likes because it blew up it just went

887
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:41,079
everywhere tur profile oops every yeah

888
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,599
you know they don't like the tur profile

889
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:46,720
I love it because I want different stuff

890
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:50,440
right I want you know I want to like I

891
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:53,039
want to experience a new flavor like

892
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,720
that every day you

893
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:58,920
know part of the reason why we like the

894
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:02,639
chem dog is cuz it was

895
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,960
different right super boo that shit's

896
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:08,480
different and I love it but the people

897
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,679
that I know that that grew it out here

898
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,480
they had to stop and they had to start

899
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,039
growing runs again because they can't

900
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,760
sell it it's like tell the story about

901
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:20,239
it tell the story about it oh okay so

902
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,200
right it's um the guy that bred it is

903
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:26,679
called Blockhead Buds and it's a um like

904
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:30,279
it's a single cultivar of the block

905
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:33,399
Berry breeding project that he made and

906
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,519
he gave the seeds to mobile J if you

907
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,519
know who mobile J is and he um so he's

908
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:41,759
just a really popular Michigan grower I

909
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,880
believe and he popped them thinking that

910
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,680
they were going to be boof because of

911
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,559
the cross that went into it I think it

912
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:53,639
has like um it's like Tropicana cookies

913
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:56,078
and uh I forget the other one um but of

914
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:58,358
course at the time with Calo being all

915
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,000
played out and orange turps just kind of

916
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:03,719
not really being a big seller and most

917
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,880
of the orange turp uh cannabis coming

918
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,838
out like green and kind of fluffy

919
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,720
looking kind of like old CIO would look

920
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:13,719
like then he just was like well this is

921
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:15,358
going to be super boof and so he grew it

922
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:17,078
out and it ended up being the like

923
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,239
heaviest yielder he's seen in a while

924
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:22,839
and czy the hit the markets well and

925
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,879
then um everyone started wanting to grow

926
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:27,719
super boof and it's funny because like

927
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,640
the actual breeder cut of blockberry is

928
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:33,719
way better and um even even the crosses

929
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:35,879
off of that now are just like they're so

930
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:38,439
much better than what the super boof is

931
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,920
but it it like the super boof because of

932
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,720
the timing on it all and um how it hit

933
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:47,920
the market it kind of almost uh it it

934
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,919
became so popular that it became a

935
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:55,078
problem well I it never actually became

936
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,880
that popular over here in

937
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:00,960
California um no but it was a Nationwide

938
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,880
popularity thing so it was like uh it it

939
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,480
was just being grown in every state as

940
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,318
it was coming online because it was uh a

941
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,318
tested yielder that could use the Athena

942
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,599
program so anybody that was coming

943
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,719
online could just uh know how to feed it

944
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:16,880
plug and play and and hit you know just

945
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,559
just plug in 3.0 EC follow their

946
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,358
parameters out of the handbook that was

947
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,558
just released and hit three three a

948
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:26,119
light no problem it was just easy easy

949
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,880
plug and playay I told my buddy I still

950
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:30,318
think he should grow it

951
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,039
and the reason why is because he yielded

952
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:36,480
so much more than the runs that even if

953
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:39,880
he took a lower price for the herb he

954
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,000
still comes out on top the thing is is

955
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,599
on top of taking a lower price it was

956
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,679
still harder to sell for sure you know

957
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:53,920
coming back to the eliteness of runs you

958
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:57,358
know like I mean I wish the elite [ __ ]

959
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,480
today was OG cuz this old guy this is

960
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:04,199
what I like to smoke right so like I

961
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,400
can't you know even with people that

962
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:09,759
have the genetics they don't want to

963
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:12,639
grow it because you know you get a lower

964
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,640
price and harder to

965
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:19,039
sell you know so in in the right Market

966
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,639
it no longer becomes about grams per

967
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:24,199
square foot yield it becomes about

968
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:27,318
dollars per square foot purchased pretty

969
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:28,679
much in every in every market right but

970
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:30,480
a lot of people don't think that way

971
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:31,598
they think oh I can produce 3 lbs of

972
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,318
light and it's like yeah but if you're

973
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,920
producing 3 lbs of light and you either

974
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:37,599
have to sit on it or sell it low and if

975
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,159
you can do two pounds of light sell it

976
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,880
all and sell it high then it if you're

977
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:44,799
moving that product then you're doing a

978
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,039
lot better I'm glad that you brought

979
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,318
this up

980
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:52,759
because leads me back to like some old

981
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:55,239
thoughts of mine like so back in the day

982
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,319
there was a time when we had the chem

983
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:02,358
dog and we had the skunk

984
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:05,558
right and we would always grow at least

985
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:07,960
three4 of our garden in the skunk and

986
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:11,480
then a quarter of the garden the chem

987
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:14,960
dog and the chem dog would be for us to

988
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,559
smoke and it would also be like to share

989
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,639
amongst our close

990
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:22,960
friends but we never sold it on a

991
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:26,719
commercial level you know

992
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,358
and you know at least not till it passed

993
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:33,639
my hands and VA skunk's hands when

994
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:36,000
um you know it got to some of the you

995
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:37,440
know guys that were like selling it at

996
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,440
the dispensaries and stuff like that

997
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,280
like Ben um trying to remember IC

998
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:47,119
Collective okay Ben started selling the

999
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,839
stuff like more you know on a mass scale

1000
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,519
but prior to that I felt like nobody

1001
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:55,159
even really knew what the chem dog was

1002
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:58,318
besides a small group of people because

1003
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:00,039
we didn't sell it you know and that's

1004
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:03,039
that's why it's so interesting that it

1005
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:05,558
actually made that Elite status and I

1006
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:08,279
guess in thinking about this the person

1007
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:10,119
that's really responsible for this and I

1008
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,079
should ask him to come and talk with me

1009
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:16,119
with us is Ben from IC

1010
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:19,400
Collective because he was the first

1011
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,838
person to bring it to

1012
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,079
dispensaries you know and and to really

1013
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,759
get it out there you know prior to that

1014
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,720
it was headstash weed so but my point

1015
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,920
was

1016
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:33,879
was the how much Financial sense it

1017
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,159
made was a

1018
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:40,640
decision even back in the day when we

1019
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:44,399
were getting you know over 6,000 a

1020
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:46,519
pound that's czy you know so

1021
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,358
like yeah I mean I can tell stories

1022
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:52,440
about that but I had a very small

1023
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:55,558
grow okay but was getting over 6,000 a

1024
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,559
pound so it makes it easy you know but

1025
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:00,040
even then it's like we have to grow the

1026
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:05,040
sour because not sour the skunk because

1027
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:10,000
it gives us so much more you know and

1028
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:13,358
so you know there's a lot of hate about

1029
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,280
like growing you know like choosing

1030
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:19,318
strains like the Lemon Cherry gelato

1031
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,640
because of like the financial sense that

1032
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:28,920
it makes to do it right but that

1033
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:28,920
was a factor even back then

1034
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,318
so today there's way more people that

1035
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:38,000
are just growing for

1036
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:41,039
themselves that you know they don't have

1037
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,199
to make the decisions on the financial

1038
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,519
aspects of

1039
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:48,838
it okay you know they have their 4x4

1040
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,639
tent they don't sell the weed they grow

1041
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:52,960
it they smoke it they give some of it

1042
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,239
away if there's stuff left over they

1043
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,800
throw it in the trash they don't even

1044
00:46:54,239 --> 00:47:00,199
[ __ ] care right those those people

1045
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:03,400
are growing because they love

1046
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:06,598
cannabis and you

1047
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:10,039
know it's funny because somebody asked

1048
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:13,960
me what the best clone I

1049
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:17,920
had you know you know to for them to

1050
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:21,559
grow and I asked them if you know they

1051
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:24,159
need to if this is a financial matter or

1052
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:27,680
if um it's just for them personally and

1053
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,679
he says it's just for me it's for the

1054
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:33,118
love of the plant I said well now you

1055
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:36,039
made it impossible for me to answer your

1056
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,960
question right because now it's personal

1057
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:41,440
preference it's all subjective right how

1058
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,679
how can I tell you what you're going to

1059
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:48,240
like the you tell me what you like the

1060
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:51,358
best right and you know but

1061
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,639
um and I love that you know and I think

1062
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:57,519
that there's so many more people today

1063
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:59,118
that are growing you know small gardens

1064
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:02,318
for their personal or For the Love of

1065
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:05,519
the plant um I think that's awesome and

1066
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:07,679
I also think that that's why maybe NATO

1067
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:11,519
dog and crybaby think that like these

1068
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:14,519
guys can be responsible for the next big

1069
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,000
thing you know um I think I said it

1070
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:17,759
before there's a there's a good chance

1071
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,920
that it comes from something like that

1072
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,680
but you still got to team up with a

1073
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,599
bigger company to Market it if if it's

1074
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:27,639
going to be something that's

1075
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:30,000
remembered you know for a long

1076
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:33,598
time

1077
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,400
so any I um sorry I was looking up a

1078
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,599
quote really quick because this made me

1079
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,920
think of something and uh I thought the

1080
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,160
rest of your life was calling no so it's

1081
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,720
a it's a Margaret me quote that says

1082
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,920
never doubt that a small group of

1083
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:48,239
thoughtful committed citizens can change

1084
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:52,119
the world indeed it's the only thing

1085
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:55,039
that has ever done so so that's why kind

1086
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:58,200
of I think that like these small

1087
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,838
dedicated hom Growers home breeders

1088
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:02,199
people that just have a love for the

1089
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,558
plant they're going to be the ones that

1090
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:06,399
that make the selection they might not

1091
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,519
bring it to Market but I think that

1092
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,519
that's going to be at least 90% of who

1093
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,440
make the Selections in terms of what is

1094
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:15,880
the next big thing to come to Market see

1095
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,838
so you almost agree with NATO

1096
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,480
dog you think that's where it's gonna

1097
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:22,838
come from it's always come from that

1098
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,199
there name one strain that came from a

1099
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:28,719
large group that they hunted themselves

1100
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:28,719
name one

1101
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:35,480
well the answer that I was going to give

1102
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,400
doesn't fit that completely but to me

1103
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,318
it's still valid is the Girl Scout

1104
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:43,760
cookies right like that clone wasn't

1105
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:46,639
found by them but it was found by [ __ ]

1106
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:50,000
right in his garage in San Francisco one

1107
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:52,719
person one garage one grow but when

1108
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,760
people think about it in the end it took

1109
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:58,439
it took cookies to make that an elite

1110
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,960
right but that that's not the that's not

1111
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,159
the question right the question is who's

1112
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,599
finding the strain it's not who's

1113
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:09,358
bringing it to Market mhm

1114
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,599
well yeah I mean to me I I kind of

1115
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,880
considered them both and now so let's

1116
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,519
say given

1117
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,519
that okay now we're going to get back in

1118
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:21,838
into debating the original topic

1119
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:24,920
so yes there is a good chance that

1120
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:27,679
someone like Cosmic here is g to find

1121
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,559
the next um

1122
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,279
the next great strain he's going to make

1123
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:34,519
the next great strain or or find it from

1124
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:38,519
a hunt

1125
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:41,358
but like how many seeds or clones you

1126
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:45,400
know can heo hunt

1127
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:49,358
versus somebody larger that has like

1128
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:51,680
like Capital behind doing this you know

1129
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:53,759
I I feel like that's where I that's kind

1130
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,279
of where I was bringing up originally

1131
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,359
when we were talking about it how like

1132
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,240
the overhead to actually run aeno hunt

1133
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,480
in a large facility is so extensive that

1134
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,239
a small individual that has the ability

1135
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,519
to tissue culture is going to be at a

1136
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,558
greater Advantage because they can have

1137
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:11,480
so many more strains than a small space

1138
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,280
with a small overhead ex ex that a

1139
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,400
commercial operator could use that same

1140
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,599
formula as far as

1141
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,838
efficiency you know so small operator

1142
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,720
could still set up the tissue culture

1143
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:28,960
right here um could could still set up

1144
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:34,598
the tissue culture and do it efficiently

1145
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,519
and so you described like a um you know

1146
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:40,079
a

1147
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:42,960
large uh pheno hunt right but whether

1148
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:46,240
it's a large or small company they could

1149
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:50,199
do a smaller feno hunt more

1150
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:55,039
often okay and still get some type of

1151
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:58,439
results from that right so

1152
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:01,759
but you know they you know I would think

1153
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,480
it would be a a good thing for Farms to

1154
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,480
say I'm going to dedicate this amount of

1155
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,440
space for R&amp;D you know we're going to

1156
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,880
test out as many strains as we can okay

1157
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,720
so that we know what we're going to put

1158
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,358
into the larger future rooms and

1159
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,639
absolutely yeah and you have to do that

1160
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:19,960
and Factor it in ahead of time because

1161
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,480
people that are just like oh we need to

1162
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,119
do a feno hunt right now because we got

1163
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,639
to get something new in the market those

1164
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,079
are the people that are like their their

1165
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:30,279
next quarter is riding on that feno hunt

1166
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,519
in order to gain a higher pack price to

1167
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,160
recoup the loss that they're running

1168
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:36,400
during that feno hunt because they are

1169
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:38,118
selling a pound here and a pound there

1170
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,358
because they're only producing a pound

1171
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:42,240
or less per strain that they're hunting

1172
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:45,279
and even within that you have to you

1173
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,759
know cherry-pick the different uh the

1174
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,880
different flower that's going into the

1175
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,839
packs one thing that can simply be done

1176
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:55,000
is is it can be turn into fresh

1177
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:57,400
frozen you know I mean you're you're

1178
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,798
talking about then still margins that

1179
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,318
are so so close at a commercial scale

1180
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:04,119
when you're when you're talking about

1181
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,558
the actual like total kilowatt hour

1182
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:09,160
usage per run versus how much you can

1183
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,359
gain for concentrate that's and it's

1184
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:12,000
limited because then you also have to

1185
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:13,400
have someone that you can sell it to for

1186
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,159
concentrate that's because you're

1187
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,160
probably doing this offseason when most

1188
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:20,719
of the concentrate operators are running

1189
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:22,679
right now like uh in in the fall uh as

1190
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:25,399
every as the Harvest is completed for

1191
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:27,159
outdoor so you there's a lot to think

1192
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,960
about there and and

1193
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:30,920
you do have to find an outlet for the

1194
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,798
product otherwise it is going to be very

1195
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:37,960
very cost prohibitive yeah I

1196
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:40,519
mean it it costs right if it didn't cost

1197
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,960
everyone would do it right for sure I

1198
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:46,039
just think that it's you

1199
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,798
know I think it's beneficial to

1200
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:50,679
everybody for sure you it's to say that

1201
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:52,400
there's a lot of variables that go into

1202
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:55,558
it but um one thing I do want to bring

1203
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,200
up too is you know Finding you know a

1204
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,040
very special plan it's almost like

1205
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,759
playing the lottery and yeah the

1206
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:03,759
genetics that go behind you know

1207
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:06,520
whatever that you know um new strain is

1208
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,280
you know kind of dictates the level of

1209
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:10,159
you the potential of that plant if you

1210
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,599
will but when it comes down to it

1211
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:14,558
finding that really special feno it it

1212
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:16,880
can be like winning the lottery and you

1213
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,000
know you can statistically win the

1214
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:23,000
lottery with just one ticket you know

1215
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:26,639
like it's uh very unlikely but it's been

1216
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,719
known to happen you know so um I always

1217
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,159
when I do like a fenal hunt of like are

1218
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:31,279
we going to win the lottery this time

1219
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:32,798
are we going to find something that's

1220
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,839
just extremely unique or are we just

1221
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:37,798
going to kind of find the best

1222
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:40,239
representation of both

1223
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:41,559
parents doing it but yeah I mean getting

1224
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:43,639
those strains out there it's there's a

1225
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:45,839
lot of variables it's not just finding

1226
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:48,400
plan it's what you do with it you know

1227
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:49,798
finding the plant is step one it's not

1228
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,358
the

1229
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:54,400
end well I've thoroughly enjoyed this

1230
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:56,759
conversation I think we should kind of

1231
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,880
bring it to a close shortly anything

1232
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,720
else you guys want to

1233
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,920
add n yeah I feel real life calling to I

1234
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:06,439
gotta get back to it all right yeah me

1235
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,720
too well I really wanted to thank both

1236
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:12,159
wolf and Cosmic for helping me out I

1237
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:15,000
hope we can do more of this in the

1238
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:17,679
future um together

1239
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,039
because I think it's way more

1240
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:26,639
interesting when when we don't all

1241
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:30,160
exactly agree you know so um I know wolf

1242
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:33,318
and I are going to try to do a podcast

1243
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,920
where we discuss the benefits of organic

1244
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:37,519
versus inorganic

1245
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,838
gardening um won't tell you what side

1246
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:42,318
either of us are on maybe you can figure

1247
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:45,038
it out but uh but yeah we're trying to

1248
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:49,000
find people on both sides of the debate

1249
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:51,480
to have a a good discussion about it so

1250
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,280
anyway thanks guys and uh we'll do this

1251
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:58,240
again soon thanks all right see you guys

1252
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,240
later see you
