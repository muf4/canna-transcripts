00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,559
hello and welcome to another episode of

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:16,920
The Way We Grow podcast today our guest

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:20,079
is at westore peace on Instagram he is

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,920
an outdoor organic hom grower I am your

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,479
host Nick

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,720
wolf so Weston how's it going um it's

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,640
going it's going good awesome excited to

9
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:34,039
be on here yeah I mean you're one of the

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,920
uh the most prolific outdoor home

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:39,679
Growers that I know of on the subreddit

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:44,399
that we are both moderators of the uh

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:46,280
rcraft marijuana subreddit and uh I feel

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,520
like you always take a lot of time and

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,120
effort to put into your outdoor crop

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,079
each year um but you know how's life

17
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:58,038
going in the offseason in the offseason

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,120
it's um me arguing myself about tripping

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,920
and uh starting to think about what

20
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,239
changes I want to make next year and how

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,600
I got a couple months and if I do want

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,040
to make changes you know what I'm going

23
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:11,158
to do and how I'm going to implement it

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,200
but normally it's um just trimming and

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,560
kind

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,320
of brainstorming about what's going to

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,240
happen next year for sure yeah I feel

28
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,158
that I feel like it's like this time of

29
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,759
year is always the time of year that at

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,200
like a commercial level we are looking

31
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,879
at genetic acquisition and um starting

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,759
to plot out

33
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,839
where we're going to plant the different

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,640
genetics based on their flowering time

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,478
sometimes we have the ability to map it

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,519
out based on their flower initiation

37
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,039
because we'll have some that'll start

38
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,560
you know two to up to four or five weeks

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,200
before the rest um and they still only

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,799
need 65 to 70 days of flow so that makes

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,079
sense too because you don't want to be

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,320
running uh all around the garden that

43
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,359
like all the stuff that's going finish

44
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,679
early is here the next and the next so

45
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,959
you don't have people scrambling around

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,520
them makes sense yep absolutely um so uh

47
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,318
what in in your garden this year

48
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,359
upcoming what what do you have planned

49
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,199
is there anything that you've already

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,280
started to look into I have been as you

51
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,318
know on the craft group hitting up all

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,919
of the grommies on there trying to start

53
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,878
doing genetics from the craft group

54
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,119
solely would be is is my main goal

55
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,120
that's cool cuz normally I buy clones

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,519
and I have a reputable source and I do

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,120
appreciate them and like them but it

58
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,640
would be cool to start putting up for of

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,319
growing you know things from giant

60
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,119
breeders start hitting up all the homies

61
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,518
and started growing you know within the

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,200
group I think that's going to that's a

63
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,840
good idea and I I'm kind of soak about

64
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,878
doing it uh how many how many times have

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,719
you ran from seed outside versus from

66
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,639
clone it do you feel as though it's like

67
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,199
a pretty even split or no not even I

68
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,079
would rather do

69
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,280
clones just because you know what you're

70
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,120
getting and every plant's going to be

71
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,158
the same so season got it my garden now

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm on season I just finished season 4

73
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,959
so season 3 I did all seeds except for

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,120
maybe two or three plants and I was

75
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,598
super stoked with some of them and I was

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,439
less stoked with some of the other ones

77
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,759
and also the variation and finishing

78
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,439
time I'd rather have two or three that I

79
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,639
know are going to finish all at the same

80
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,079
time rather than having you know 15

81
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,399
different plants that are skewed across

82
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,440
the the finishing lines and like also

83
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,519
you get into where like you notice

84
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,199
certain plants have specific needs well

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,519
I'm not here all I'm not here all the

86
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,079
time and I have to have something that I

87
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,200
can kind of get into a routine on if I

88
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,959
can figure out two plants you know

89
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,280
fairly quickly in the season it's easier

90
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,519
than me trying to play it by year on 15

91
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,199
different you know gen you know 15

92
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,759
different splits for sure I mean

93
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,919
especially cuz um for all those

94
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,919
listeners that don't know uh you you use

95
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,958
uh raised pots correct like uh fabric

96
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,598
pots for your for your plants so if you

97
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,519
on Reddit I have a bunch of pictures but

98
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,639
I do I use raised pots I use fabric pots

99
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,438
which is pretty standard I do have a

100
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,279
grapple base under each one of them and

101
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:07,078
this last year I moved up to 200 gallon

102
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,840
pots but yes I used I used raised pots

103
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,400
off the ground and I have a buffer

104
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,759
between the between the ground soil and

105
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,720
the bottom of the pot I found that in

106
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,120
rainy Seasons that your pot touches the

107
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,359
ground especially if you live somewhere

108
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,399
where water is going to be running down

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,719
like the way our property is laid out it

110
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,399
will run off the hill and come down and

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
run through the garden that they will

112
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,478
just be soaking water up if it rains for

113
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,800
a week you know even lightly the ground

114
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,319
gets wet and then they're constantly

115
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,960
Wicky moisture so that kills your

116
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,918
ability to water very much cuz you got

117
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,399
to keep the top kind of wet but then you

118
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,918
can't feed and you can't like you want

119
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,519
to do something the pot's already

120
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:42,079
saturated and you got to you can't it

121
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,279
kind of slows your ability to make a

122
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,599
move that makes sense that's a that's a

123
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,638
cool application of using gravel for

124
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,520
like a almost like a raised water table

125
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,680
um where you're getting it outside of

126
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,680
the zone of uh the flooding that's

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,240
coming down through your property there

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,560
um you know you live and you see it a

129
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,240
couple years and you make you know had

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,399
to you know kind of find tun it you see

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,439
what you see I didn't know the first

132
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,679
year that that was going to happen and

133
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,240
then you see it and then by then I

134
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,400
wanted to run the life of my last plots

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,280
out in soil and then so when I moved up

136
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,279
and switched then I went and did went

137
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,439
ahead and made those changes nice well I

138
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,599
want to come back to your growing style

139
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:21,279
but I I want to find out first in your

140
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,080
growing Journey um what were some of the

141
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,038
first plants that you ever grew whether

142
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,599
it be cannabis or otherwise um you know

143
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,240
we've had some people on here where

144
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,240
Cactus was their first plant that their

145
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,120
grandma gave them or something and then

146
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,879
some people that never grew even a

147
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,840
vegetable before they started growing

148
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,959
cannabis and then they started venturing

149
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,918
into the world of other gardening and uh

150
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,279
applications of the knowledge that

151
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,079
they've gained from growing cannabis so

152
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,159
uh for you what was what was your first

153
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:52,560
experience growing any type of plant my

154
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,319
first experienc in growing was in

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,000
Missouri I had a buddy who was growing

156
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,000
indoor and needed to move it somewhere

157
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,240
um due to some circumstances that were

158
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,600
out favorable

159
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,600
and so I took them in and started

160
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,120
growing them and then I real I didn't

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,360
let me phrase this how I was going to

162
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,959
say it realized how complicated it was

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,160
but also how interesting it was at the

164
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,758
same time and that's really really I've

165
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,400
taken what knowledge I have from

166
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
Cannabis and moved it outwards because I

167
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,239
really didn't wasn't into like very much

168
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,079
agriculture before that any house plants

169
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,280
or anything oh wow that's pretty cool

170
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,159
you know it's like I said it's kind of a

171
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,758
split 50/50 of people that started you

172
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,680
know oh Grandma had a vegetable garden

173
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,720
and I helped her out with it or I had no

174
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,639
care for vegetables or other gardening

175
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,560
and then cannabis was my gateway drug

176
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,439
into gardening so um it has the power to

177
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,759
do that you know it it definitely does

178
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,598
um well that's really cool to hear uh

179
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,080
what what do you like to garden now

180
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:49,879
other than cannabis is there anything

181
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,560
else that you have uh in your garden cuz

182
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:55,478
I know you have a pretty big sort of

183
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,360
garden space I have we have aelas my

184
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:00,079
wife has all the all the stuff around

185
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,439
the house I don't we have mint and Rose

186
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,038
and lemon balm and the thing that I

187
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,680
appreciate the most is she grows uh

188
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,439
angel wing Bonas and that is one of my

189
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,000
favorite plant those grows and the way

190
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:13,680
it flowers is there's it's something

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,720
special about that one but she does she

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,680
grows uh angel wing Bonas and I uh I put

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,800
in the compost tea and help uh keep them

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,199
going nice nice um well let's let's go

195
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,879
and touch back then on um some of your

196
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,038
first cannabis growing Adventures I

197
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:36,919
guess uh so it sounds like your first

198
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:39,000
experience was um almost put like in an

199
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,359
emergency situation where you helping a

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,360
friend out by taking plants from a

201
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,598
non-ideal situation putting them in a

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,919
situation where you could help them out

203
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,560
um what did you learn from that how did

204
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,719
you go about uh deciding how you how you

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,079
were going to continue to grow these

206
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,319
plants and did you get to a successful

207
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,639
Harvest yes I took them when they were

208
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,800
just in flow and I brought them over and

209
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,560
this probably wasn't a very good

210
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,879
experience to is to bring up but it

211
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,000
really got my uh I mean as small as it

212
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,280
was got my feet wet I think it was about

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,478
12 plants but I brought them from his

214
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,239
house over to mine and we got them to

215
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,318
flour and we got them to harvest and we

216
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,720
got them Pro you know got them dried and

217
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,960
that was kind of what sparked me into it

218
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,639
and then as far as my first big

219
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,079
adventure was deciding to move out of

220
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,800
Missouri and move to California and just

221
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,598
be like you know here we

222
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,520
go

223
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:31,399
cool um so once you once you kind of

224
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:35,158
took that step from Missouri to

225
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:37,158
California it it sounds like was uh like

226
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,319
cannabis cultivation in your mind was

227
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:41,319
that something that you were kind of

228
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,039
driven by in any way oh

229
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,360
100% 100% cuz you know I don't know if

230
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:50,799
you've ever lived in the midwest but I

231
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:54,159
want to say for like 2012 I mean the

232
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,479
amount of decent weed you could get was

233
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,879
okay but it's kind of perplexing when

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,000
you know how things work on the you know

235
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,159
on the West Coast to see like trash run

236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,720
like to see garbage come in there and

237
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,919
you're like how does like how does this

238
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,120
product make it to the End Market like

239
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,919
there's no you know no reason and then I

240
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,159
kind of got I wanted to move somewhere

241
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,078
and I was picking Colorado or California

242
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:20,360
and I had came out to trim Camp one year

243
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:22,039
at a buddy's house and then me and my

244
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,399
wife my girlfriend at the time my wife

245
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,599
now I was like we're moving to

246
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,078
California and she was like well you're

247
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,040
okay with it and I was like you let's do

248
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:30,519
it and I kind of moved out here didn't

249
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,838
really have anywhere to live when I got

250
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,240
out of here I got in contact with my

251
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,680
friend and then just started working for

252
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,959
him when I got here cool like at a at at

253
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:42,479
a cannabis farm or something or yeah had

254
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,719
a farm cool how was your experience with

255
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,680
the the Cannabis Farms like uh in terms

256
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,160
of a commercial cultivation um operation

257
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,359
oh there's the good and there's the

258
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,039
really bad there's the well back then

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,919
there was the there was the good and

260
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,319
there was the atrocious and it depended

261
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,319
on where you went you could see things

262
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,720
that you didn't want to see or you know

263
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,760
as far as just talking about growing

264
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,800
like people spraying you know Avid and

265
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,360
floride or doing whatever they can to

266
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,838
compensate for their lack of skill to

267
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,360
give a product to the End Market you

268
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,839
know without far any consequences or not

269
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,320
thinking about anything outside of you

270
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,480
know out of profit and then you see

271
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,680
people who cared about it and you really

272
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,839
kind of see the difference in Growers

273
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,599
when you travel around and see the

274
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,600
different Farms cuz it's there's a stark

275
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,000
difference or was a stark difference for

276
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,759
The Growers that are still

277
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,440
around for sure did you only um have

278
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,600
that one commercial experience with your

279
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,839
friend that you worked with or did you

280
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,759
um it sounds like you were looking at

281
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,320
other farms at least by their practices

282
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,000
did you have an opportunity to work with

283
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,120
any of them oh yeah so I came out and I

284
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,480
worked with my buddy the first and the

285
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,600
second year and then I got hired on to a

286
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,800
big farm up in Lake County California

287
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,240
and so it was 70 Acres total 2 35 acre

288
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,120
plots on the side of a mountain so um

289
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,200
old school black market

290
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,519
farm and there were tiered into the side

291
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,399
of this mountain were 5x five by five

292
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,000
poles and so all teered down what do you

293
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,679
want to call it all cut out of the

294
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,958
mountain for these holes and they were

295
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:13,078
just I don't know like 400 gallons of

296
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,439
dirt in each hole or more and so I

297
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:19,879
started doing that um and that ended in

298
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,959
a raid which wasn't very fun um but

299
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,000
after that I worked green houses I

300
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,518
worked for another farmer and then in

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,078
between getting growing jobs I would go

302
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,560
around and do peace meal work at other

303
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,919
Farms so I mean I'll probably work at

304
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:35,719
you know 15 16 different places okay um

305
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,719
are there are there any experiences that

306
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,959
you had while working at those places

307
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,639
that stand out that you'd feel

308
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,199
comfortable talking about just to kind

309
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,440
of spread a little bit of the

310
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,959
experiential

311
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,120
knowledge well that's a vast question

312
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:53,319
like what what kind of experiences good

313
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,200
experiences bad like I experiences or

314
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,680
like inspirational or kind of like what

315
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,079
got me going well let's let's take it

316
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,479
from the route of um through your

317
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,439
experience uh working at all these

318
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,839
different facilities at all these

319
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,360
different Farms what did you pick up

320
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,920
that you carried with you and what were

321
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,959
things that you knew you needed to you

322
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:24,439
needed to avoid when um having your own

323
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:26,159
grow um avoiding laziness cuz what a lot

324
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,160
of the farmers well cuz there was so

325
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,559
much money into it back in the day is

326
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,958
that someone would own a proper and they

327
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,119
wouldn't necessarily they would know how

328
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,638
to grow but they would be as hands off

329
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,198
as they could with it and the lack of

330
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,198
atten attentiveness is a huge thing like

331
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:42,399
trying to automate your outdoor grow is

332
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:44,120
I don't want to say it's lazy I mean

333
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,679
there's obviously perks to it but if

334
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,600
you're not an attentive grower you need

335
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,078
to be in the if you're not in the garden

336
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,959
you don't know what's going on like I

337
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,479
don't care how many people you hire like

338
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,518
if you're the one in charge of it and

339
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,320
you're not there it's not going to go

340
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,480
well 100% going to fail you know if you

341
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,199
try to subc trct your job to somebody

342
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,839
else who has less experience than you it

343
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,639
always turns out bad and so that's like

344
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,480
kind of what you learn is like if you

345
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,159
want this to go from the start to the

346
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,519
Finish as well as it can like you're you

347
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,559
can't go on vacation you can maybe take

348
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,919
two days three days off at the most like

349
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,919
I mean but you need to be there and you

350
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,759
need to be in the garden every other day

351
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,159
hands down that's like the that's what

352
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,159
you know people who aren't into growing

353
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,159
and start growing outdoor it's not a

354
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,958
hands-off thing by any means I mean

355
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:28,759
there's lots of watching and sitting and

356
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,319
watching but there's also a purpose to

357
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,759
that too and that's like you need to

358
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,560
know when you might have a bug infection

359
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,639
start or infestation starting or you

360
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,958
need to know hey these things look like

361
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,440
they're getting underwater Because by

362
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,119
the next morning they look you know like

363
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,760
there's a lot of what a lot of what you

364
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,078
are going to need to know about the

365
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,278
plants is just going to be staring at

366
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,198
them if it's it sounds stupid but when

367
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:48,720
you start doing it you're going to

368
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,599
realize that I mean like go sit out

369
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,120
there for an hour in the morning and at

370
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,440
night and in the mid afternoon and watch

371
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,399
the differences and you know start

372
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,839
tracking how they're

373
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,759
reacting right definitely like picking

374
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,839
up on the trends so that you can apply

375
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,399
the proper approach whether it be

376
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,639
through like an IPM practice or a

377
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,440
nutrient application especially if

378
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,000
you're growing in um some sort of uh

379
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,320
living soil situation or something where

380
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,440
you're using the biology to make the

381
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,440
nutrients readily available you have to

382
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,480
really be almost ahead of the curve on

383
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,720
that where you you can't be like

384
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,199
reactory you have to be proactive about

385
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,959
it and that takes a lot of attention

386
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,919
yeah because I mean 90 5% of what you're

387
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:34,838
going to use organically is not water

388
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,039
soluble so if you see a problem you

389
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,320
you're already late you're late to the

390
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:39,240
game by the time you you pick up on it

391
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,959
right and that's where you kind of got

392
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,560
to learn what to do ahead of time

393
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,198
because by the time you figure out you

394
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,758
did something wrong now you've spent a

395
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,000
week trying to correct that but you were

396
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,199
already a week behind yeah absolutely

397
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,679
couldn't agree more it's hard to explain

398
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:53,479
that to people it's like by the time you

399
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,679
see the problem you you're already late

400
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,320
to the game you're already late to the

401
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,198
party for sure as opposed to like

402
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,720
Hydroponics where you could just just

403
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,399
have like missed a couple of phing for a

404
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
day or two and it's going to go

405
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,360
catastrophic you're going to see a lot

406
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,639
of issues pop up from that and

407
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,159
then both of them kind of have their

408
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,240
positives and and negatives and I I

409
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,360
think that you know that is definitely a

410
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,480
conversation for another day but it's so

411
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:23,440
fascinating to hear

412
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:26,039
um I I I do love Organics when you like

413
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,480
use the analogy of a battery where the

414
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,159
the bigger the battery the more like run

415
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,120
time you have without having to worry

416
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,559
too much about it um so you know I kind

417
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,480
of want to get back into how you're

418
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:40,479
growing now and how you developed your

419
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,440
growing style and so you kind of told us

420
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,039
about your negative experience with this

421
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,839
these different cultivation uh jobs that

422
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:51,559
you had um what were some of the things

423
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,040
that you picked up from these different

424
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:57,439
jobs that you took with you and either

425
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:01,360
uh tried to apply

426
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,040
to uh quent cultivation experiences or

427
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,680
what you still keep in your tool belt

428
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,559
that you're using today well and that's

429
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,359
yes I love that question because a lot

430
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,318
of the negative experiences are learning

431
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,199
what not to do working in other peaceful

432
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:15,799
places and a good thing about that is

433
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:17,159
you get to see a wide array of people

434
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,359
trying different things and seeing what

435
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,719
works and what doesn't work without

436
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,079
having to experience them yourself

437
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,639
because with outdoor growing you get one

438
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:26,159
shot a year so the ability to rerun

439
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,399
something over and over and figure out

440
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,039
what's going on what works and what

441
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,078
doesn't work could take a decade you

442
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,519
know like because you can you're not

443
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,078
doing five six runs a year and you're

444
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,399
like okay that works that doesn't work

445
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:39,519
that doesn't work but what I did pick up

446
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,879
is as far as outdoor growing goes I

447
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,639
really don't like synthetics or

448
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,198
non-organic food sources I don't feel

449
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,480
like they perform as well just from what

450
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,838
I've seen and I like indoors completely

451
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,480
different story but Outdoors you if you

452
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:57,360
you compost tea any day 100% of the time

453
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,000
my money's on it so as far as what I've

454
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,079
learned that works is

455
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,759
compost teas figuring out your watering

456
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:09,399
and then as far as food sources going

457
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,318
just using a good multi-purpose food in

458
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,959
the beginning and then kind of playing

459
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:14,720
it with some top dresses by ear

460
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,880
throughout the year cuz your compost tea

461
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,240
if you have a good compost te is going

462
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,480
to provide a lot of nutrition because

463
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,959
you don't need a you don't need a you're

464
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,959
not pumping them you don't need a lot of

465
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,120
nutrition you just need something

466
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,798
consistent and you need a ability for

467
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,839
the soil to unlock what food is already

468
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:32,400
in there and that's what a compost te

469
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:36,119
does absolutely what's uh what's your

470
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,440
typical go-to compost tea um if you're

471
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,199
just applying something throughout the

472
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,558
year I do

473
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,319
about four eight cups four to eight cups

474
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,759
of worm castings four cups of compost

475
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,960
and the worm castings and the type of

476
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:51,798
compost you get are going to make a

477
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,319
night and day difference if you get some

478
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:55,119
compost from the grow store it has

479
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,918
sticks and twigs and it looks like it's

480
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,119
meant for you know mulch for someone

481
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,759
like flower bed it's not going to works

482
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,839
so you need a high compost or a high

483
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,279
high quality compost and I mean there's

484
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,240
a couple different you can use like

485
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,440
there's the C compost from organ there's

486
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,679
the Malibu blend which I really don't

487
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,960
like cuz it comes from it's steer manure

488
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,360
and there's like there can be bugs and

489
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,679
stuff in it I've learned that over the

490
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,918
years to avoid that but basically Earth

491
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,480
Thor castings

492
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,880
compost telt meal alphalpha meal maybe a

493
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,279
little bit of humic

494
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,559
acid uh maybe a little bit of azomite

495
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,678
and then just black strap molasses or

496
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,960
just molasses you can get a grow store

497
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,720
and and do you do like uh aeration for

498
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,319
it or do you do like just a quick mix no

499
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,798
do an airra and you're going to run it

500
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,480
about 24 hours and doing outdoor

501
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:46,798
temperature is a big thing so you never

502
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,960
want to start it in the morning you

503
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,599
start it in the morning and it sits in

504
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,919
the sun all day you can like try to

505
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,678
cover it with light but the temperature

506
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,559
is really going to play into it so you

507
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,840
want to start it at night run it all

508
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,480
night check it in the morning probably

509
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:00,798
run it the rest of the day and by the

510
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,919
next morning it's going to be it's it's

511
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,319
going to be popping off and you'll see

512
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,640
the foam and you'll see all the uh CO2

513
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,720
coming out of it and that's how you know

514
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:12,440
you're where you want to be cool that's

515
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,880
pretty cool um so as you've kind as you

516
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,480
were learning all these different sort

517
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,760
of methods and uh finding that you know

518
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,839
compost te's and the applications of

519
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:24,558
different composts and worm castings and

520
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:27,319
stuff um are extremely beneficial what

521
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:29,240
what did you start to uh develop in

522
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,960
terms of your other top dressing

523
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,798
practices or other growing practices

524
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,319
that you're still using

525
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,759
today um thinning out the plants um I

526
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,279
don't you've seen outdoor plants a lot

527
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,879
of people don't know if you have a a

528
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:45,960
plant that's 10 ft tall I mean you're

529
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,840
going to say from the stock out at least

530
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,679
40% of that needs to be cleaned out

531
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,399
because you're not going to get any

532
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,840
Light breaking through there and so what

533
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,159
you learn is if you leave all of that on

534
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,599
there it's going to low kill the size of

535
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,280
your buds and also create a place for

536
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,279
mold so you really want to worry about

537
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,359
air flow that's another good one

538
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,960
um keeping your plants spread apart not

539
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,479
having them grow into each other is

540
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,240
going to stop bugs from

541
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,519
spreading um I've seen Gardens get

542
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,919
ravished by broad mites I mean but if

543
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,720
you have everything right next to each

544
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,640
other you're never like you're you're

545
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,480
not going to stand a chance because

546
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,400
they're going to spread too

547
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,240
quick for sure yeah I am we we typically

548
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,360
will grow in row but it it is like a

549
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,200
much larger production what what I'm

550
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:30,678
doing at like the commercial facility

551
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,360
versus what you're doing at at your home

552
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:36,559
and I I love how you have your different

553
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:39,119
beds sort of separated out and

554
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,480
um how how you have the ability to kind

555
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,279
of address each plant's needs in a very

556
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,038
holistic approach of of applying a meal

557
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:50,359
of this or you know

558
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:54,319
uh this that or the other thing um in an

559
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:58,719
organic form um what what have been some

560
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:02,000
of your recent uh like let let's let's

561
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,079
ask this in a two-part question so um in

562
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,119
terms of what has worked really well for

563
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,918
you recently in the garden what would

564
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,678
some of those things be and what would

565
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,360
also be some things that haven't very

566
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:17,519
worked very well for you in the garden

567
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:19,759
recently um sort of the the pros and the

568
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,319
yeah okay uh worked very well since I

569
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,640
moved this spot not worrying about the

570
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,879
height or the size of the plant I found

571
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,559
that over the last couple years that the

572
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,520
amount of so you have is going to

573
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,359
correlate with how much bud you're going

574
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,400
to get off the plant regardless of the

575
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,119
size of the plant so trying to plant

576
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,559
early to get larger plants generally

577
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:41,158
isn't going to yield anything more than

578
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:43,200
you planning two weeks later and having

579
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,240
a smaller but a fatter plant which is a

580
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,840
good thing to know I don't think a lot

581
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,038
of people realize that cuz if you see it

582
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,558
you know I had one from seed last year

583
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:52,720
that was 12T tall all it did was create

584
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,480
a headache a lot of plant to work on and

585
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,640
got the same thing that a plant that was

586
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,960
you know 6 to 7t tall would have had on

587
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,919
it sure I guess training and not trying

588
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,600
to shoot for the largest plant

589
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:06,720
competition is a really you know is a

590
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,119
really good one cuz you with like when

591
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,880
it comes to working on them and not

592
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,000
having a limited amount of time to do

593
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,520
that is you don't want to have to be

594
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,960
trucking a ladder around or you know if

595
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,679
you can't see the tops of the buds you

596
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,679
don't know if a caterpillar got in or

597
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,559
like you create this scenario where

598
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,798
you're not gaining anything but but a

599
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,079
lot more work to get the same end result

600
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,000
and I I don't think a lot of people

601
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,599
realize that too with I mean you can get

602
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,159
oud and noed by a big plant and they are

603
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,199
very cool but when you're the one taking

604
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,080
care of it that is it's not necessarily

605
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,880
very cool no and then also it it it

606
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,558
feels like a lot of the uh especially in

607
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,440
an organic scenario a lot of the uh

608
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,879
productivity potential for each plant is

609
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,400
heavily dependent upon the root space of

610
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,039
that plant and so if you're and yeah

611
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,320
right and so if you're growing in a in a

612
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,960
limited root space say like a raised a

613
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:57,119
raised pot or a raised bed of some kind

614
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,480
or you're planting them uh in a row or

615
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,759
something else where they are are then

616
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,319
sort of budding up on each other so they

617
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:07,319
only have a specific square footage per

618
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,558
plant that they have like sole dominance

619
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,038
over versus the other plants then coming

620
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:12,720
in and The Roots interchanging so they

621
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,558
only have a certain amount that they can

622
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,919
work with and so yeah if you're going to

623
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,480
get a bigger plant then sure you're

624
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,000
going to have a bigger biomass but all

625
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,079
that bigger biomass is taking energy

626
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,359
away from what could be flower sight

627
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:28,599
production um 100% I mean I even see

628
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:31,119
this in indoor too like smaller plants

629
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:32,839
usually produce the Daner buds uh they

630
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,119
can just put a lot more effort into it

631
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:37,480
especially when you're talking about

632
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:38,558
similar pot sizes um you know growing up

633
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,679
you were going to have a three

634
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,278
four-footer next to a two-footer and the

635
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,919
same amount of pot with the same amount

636
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:45,599
of roots you're going to have have an

637
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,559
yes it's going to focus more energy into

638
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,599
production for sure 100% it might not be

639
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:51,319
the like comparable yields like you

640
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,439
might get more yield out of the three or

641
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:57,599
four footer next to the two-footer um

642
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,840
but the each individual flower might

643
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,278
have a little little bit more appeal to

644
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,918
it you know it might have a better um

645
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:06,798
genetic expression or

646
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,559
morphology uh sometimes those bigger

647
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,359
plants when you grow too many Bud sites

648
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:14,158
on them the flowers seem to lose a

649
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:18,079
little bit of that luster that would be

650
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:21,760
on something that is a more manicured

651
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:24,038
plant that has fewer Bud sites as as it

652
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,558
relates to the root size yeah and I

653
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:27,398
think that like with outdoor too and

654
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:29,278
especially with Organic because you're

655
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:30,798
not able to like you're not able to pump

656
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,359
it like there's only so much you can do

657
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,759
to feed it right you can do a compost

658
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:38,359
tap which is going to start pre you know

659
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,319
creating a bioavailable nutrient but not

660
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:42,759
necessarily in a large amount that you

661
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,000
want to really keep an eye on your soil

662
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:47,119
size to your plant size cuz as above so

663
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,880
below like you don't want your plant

664
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,599
five times bigger than the pot I mean

665
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,880
you want to have it maybe you know your

666
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:55,319
your flowering plant two to three times

667
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,039
bigger than your like the soil area

668
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,038
width and height wise because you're

669
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,079
going to run into that we're going to

670
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,759
get string air buds like you can have as

671
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,000
many Bud sights on it as you want but if

672
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,440
it doesn't have you know you can have a

673
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,599
Cadillac but if you put a four-cylinder

674
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,240
in there it's not going to be like you

675
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,519
got to keep everything you got to keep

676
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,759
everything balanced you know you can't

677
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:15,038
have a giant plant with no soil and no

678
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,558
food no ability to feed it uh right so

679
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,000
you got to kind of keep that in mind it

680
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:22,839
almost seems like oversizing the pot to

681
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,240
the plant size uh tends to provide the

682
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,639
longest runway for what's available and

683
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,319
so the plant can just it can do the the

684
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,480
best that it can do in the environment

685
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:35,359
without being limited by something like

686
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,480
a the root size or something like that

687
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,599
100% And then I I don't think you know I

688
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,519
don't know that a lot of people think

689
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,240
this but like if you're organic growing

690
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,960
and I don't know how analogy put this

691
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,960
you're like the pit crew at NASCAR

692
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,278
you're not the race car driver like

693
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,919
you're there trying to make sure

694
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,960
everything's ready for when it wants to

695
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,919
use it you're not the one you know

696
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,919
putting the gas on steering the wheel

697
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,720
you're just trying to be there and

698
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,080
you're trying to give the plant

699
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,079
everything it needs so it can do what it

700
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,278
want wants to do but like if you try to

701
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,240
take the range too much that's when

702
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:03,679
you're going to go off the rails cuz

703
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,120
it's only going to do what it wants to

704
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,360
do you know and like you need to be

705
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,959
there and make sure that has what it

706
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,240
needs but it's like you're not really

707
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,120
steering the car you're just kinding to

708
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,079
making sure it's it's fueled for sure

709
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,879
and even even in that same analogy of

710
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,798
like a race car right you're you're not

711
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,760
trying to run the fuel to empty you're

712
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,359
going to try and fill it up before it

713
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,038
gets too low because you don't want to

714
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,359
throw that race car off balance by

715
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,879
having a a a weight increase and

716
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,759
decrease that's going to

717
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,600
sort of like make that battery of the

718
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,278
root Zone overcharged or undercharged

719
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:39,798
you want to kind of keep it at this nice

720
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:42,278
level so that it it it has the buffet to

721
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:44,000
eat from without ever needing to feel

722
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:47,079
like it needs to wait for that Buffet to

723
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,159
get refilled oh yeah 100 well that plays

724
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:51,480
in the pH too because if you if you

725
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,640
don't keep everything as far as being

726
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,480
able to control pH in a pot outdoor you

727
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,640
you can't all you can do is do

728
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,240
everything right so that it has what it

729
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,919
so it doesn't go out of balance because

730
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,278
I mean if you overfeed over compost T

731
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,278
put too much you can go too acidic or if

732
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:08,880
you want to over amend with like azomite

733
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:10,919
or you want to use like a a silica Rock

734
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,120
based product you're going to you're

735
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,679
going to keep you got to pick you got to

736
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,079
kind of keep giving it in the middle

737
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,880
ground so it has what it needs or it

738
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,519
will it will go out of pH which is it

739
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,480
happens rarely but when it does like

740
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,798
they're you know you're kind of you shot

741
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,319
your foot there you're done yeah I agree

742
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,918
it it is it is one of those things where

743
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,798
is a boat so like it's hard to over

744
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,799
steer it but if you do over steer it

745
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:38,960
it's really hard to correct it

746
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:41,798
um so little little tiny tweaks here and

747
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,360
there always seem to work the best as

748
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:47,558
opposed to these giant fluctuations in

749
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:51,398
um additions or subtractions to what's

750
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:53,639
there and available for the plant um so

751
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:56,599
I want to ask in your current setup

752
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,880
since you did just restart into larger

753
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:03,079
did you say 200 gallon pots I went from

754
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,640
150 to 200 yes okay so did you restart

755
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:09,119
that all from scratch did you do a fresh

756
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,240
uh mix of new potting mix and substrate

757
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,239
or did you use older

758
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,200
substrate no I went with new substrate

759
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,319
um okay what's your ideal mix like if

760
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,080
you know how about you run us through

761
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:24,119
what you did to prepare those 200-gallon

762
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,839
beds so that anybody that's thinking

763
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,639
about growing some large outdoor plants

764
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,599
has an idea of what it takes to get one

765
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,200
of those

766
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:35,639
started well it depend so uh your soil

767
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,159
that you're going to want to use is

768
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,720
really going to be kind of dependent on

769
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,200
your growing style and a thing to not

770
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,759
get carried away with if you were

771
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,720
starting from scratch is you don't need

772
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:48,079
a heavily fed soil you don't need a hot

773
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,600
soil you don't need something with you

774
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,240
know that's loaded up with every single

775
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,959
Amendment on the earth on it you want

776
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,919
something very simple you want perite

777
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,919
heat

778
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,919
moth um

779
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,079
pH balance you want a buffer in there

780
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,798
and maybe a very light food and then you

781
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,918
can that allows you to mend it yourself

782
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:10,639
because the first year I got soil I got

783
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,399
you know it was basically like a grow

784
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,880
Shop's version of like Fox Farm or

785
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:15,398
something but they had loaded it out it

786
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,600
had every Amendment like you stick your

787
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:18,319
hand in the bag and it would burn your

788
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:20,798
hand like it was hot like there was a

789
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,480
lot going on there and what that kind of

790
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,038
kills your ability to do is do anything

791
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,200
else CU it's already been done like if

792
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:27,679
you were trying to make a change like

793
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,798
you already everything's under the sun's

794
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,679
already in there you can't do anything

795
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,119
with it which doesn't mean it's bad it

796
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:33,798
means you're going to want run water

797
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,918
you're going to run a light tea that's

798
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:36,599
about as far as you're going to go with

799
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,000
it what I like to do now is get a more

800
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:43,199
basic soil without a lot of food I found

801
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,599
that downto Earth biofish is a very very

802
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,120
good Amendment for the beginning so I'll

803
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,558
amend per bag with biofish and make sure

804
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:53,319
it's really well mixed in there and then

805
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:55,480
I will pre-water all the pots and try to

806
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,200
keep them wet for a week or two before

807
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,278
I'm going to plant in there to like

808
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,640
start the biological process in there

809
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:03,359
get everything alive get everything

810
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,880
working and then you want to check to

811
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,199
make sure your soil's not hot cuz if

812
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,360
your soil's hot you're going to burn

813
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,880
your plants and that's like one thing

814
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:11,798
that no one ever teaches you like hot

815
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,880
soil is literally Outdoors it's going to

816
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:14,038
be hot like you're going to put your

817
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,799
hand in there and it's going to be steam

818
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:18,720
coming out of it you want to kind of

819
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:20,398
kick off the biological process and let

820
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,480
that work its way through a little bit

821
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:25,038
before you're going to plant your plants

822
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:29,000
in there so it's it's like almost making

823
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:33,359
a fresh uh super soil or a living soil

824
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:37,200
of sorts where you're taking um your uh

825
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:40,079
paracity uh um fraction of the media

826
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,200
like your perlite or your pmus or uh

827
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:47,439
volcanic rock or anything like that then

828
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:51,399
your substrate Side pet Moss uh um cocoa

829
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,399
quar anything like that and then your um

830
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,239
biological side which is also kind of a

831
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:57,239
substrate side where it's your uh

832
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,558
compost adding all those together then

833
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,159
adding your sort of nitrogen potassium

834
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:06,119
phosphorus calcium magnesium all those

835
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,799
different macros and micros mixing those

836
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:09,638
all together and all of a sudden you

837
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,398
have all this biological activity and

838
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:13,519
that biological activity is pushing off

839
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:16,038
a bunch of heat and you want to wait for

840
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,120
that biological activity to kind of slow

841
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:21,440
down because you're right it it just not

842
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,518
only is it like hot in terms of the

843
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,399
chemical Avail or the nutrient

844
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,638
availability is going to be so high that

845
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:31,638
the plant's going to be burnt through

846
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:33,398
the osmotic stress of the electrical

847
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:36,158
conductivity of everything that falls

848
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:39,798
into solution while the biology is that

849
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,200
active but also the actual thermophilic

850
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:46,079
composting that's occurring that's going

851
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,519
to overheat the root Zone and cause uh

852
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,519
hypothermia to the roots and actually

853
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,880
cause uh death and Decay translated that

854
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,880
way better than what I was saying but

855
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,240
yes 100% it's like that's when you hear

856
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,679
hot soil everybody thinks nutrients well

857
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,759
it like out hot soil is literally

858
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,679
temperature hot soil and even if it will

859
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,079
burn it will kill the plant just bace

860
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,919
cuz I mean it could be like we look at

861
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,439
the summer here it's like 70 but if you

862
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,679
stick your hand in there and it's 95

863
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,320
degre you put a plant there it's done

864
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,798
yeah absolutely I mean a 95 degree root

865
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,918
zone is not great especially when you're

866
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:20,558
going from 60° to 95 degre that's like

867
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,320
maybe you could slowly get up to 95

868
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,119
degrees and hold it for a few days if

869
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:28,599
you have available water but definitely

870
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,359
not if it's just from one to the n yeah

871
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,599
yeah like I mean it can handle higher

872
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:35,398
temperatures in the summer like this

873
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:37,638
summer it was 112° for a week straight

874
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:39,479
and the plants were definitely they were

875
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:41,119
not having it but they you know they H

876
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,639
through but if you did that to a plant

877
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,839
it would you know it'd be game over it

878
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:47,038
it's also one of the reasons why you

879
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:50,599
have to turn thermophilic compost

880
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:53,679
because um it'll combust if you have it

881
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:57,439
at the like perfect level of dryness to

882
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,000
wetness ratio and you have the just the

883
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,519
you know right amount of enzymes in

884
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,679
there the outside temperature and

885
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:05,880
humidity aren't uh you know

886
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,159
disadvantageous for causing a fire to

887
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,519
start it'll just spontaneously combust

888
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,399
and I have never seen at videos now I my

889
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:15,880
my dad had compost in our backyard and

890
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,839
it caught on fire one year and he had to

891
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,039
spray it down with a hose um it was

892
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,558
crazy I I didn't know it could happen

893
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,480
either until I saw but now I'm always

894
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:28,480
very cautious about making thermophilic

895
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,079
compost the power of the microb yeah

896
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,960
that that fact that they can get that

897
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:36,278
hot all the way up to the point of

898
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,440
combustion and still be active yeah

899
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:43,398
that's insane you know it it makes me

900
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,798
think of those uh like the extremophiles

901
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:47,918
that live near the thermal vents in the

902
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:50,240
bottom of the ocean that you know it's

903
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,720
like oh where the water would boil if it

904
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,558
could but it's under so Lally can be

905
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,720
higher than boiling water temperatures

906
00:33:54,558 --> 00:34:00,918
yeah right yeah two 300° water and these

907
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,960
crabs and Crustaceans and worms and

908
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,679
stuff are living and they're fine with

909
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,358
it it's nature is crazy and you know

910
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,878
it's it it's really cool to know that

911
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,239
there are these extreme differences

912
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:15,639
between something that does use this

913
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,638
biologically

914
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,760
active substrate versus a

915
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,079
non-biologically active substrate in

916
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,399
like Hydroponics and you can achieve

917
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,639
really great results with both and the

918
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,878
interactions between the rizosphere and

919
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,919
the substrate and the nutrients that are

920
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:36,838
either being produced biologically or

921
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,239
being introduced through the nutrient

922
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:40,599
water

923
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,319
package the reaction with the roots is

924
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:45,599
also super different too like the root

925
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,960
exites that are produced in an organic

926
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,320
media to help attract the specific

927
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,878
biology that's going to help Cate the

928
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,000
specific nutrients to make them

929
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,759
available there's something really cool

930
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,480
about that I mean how long did that

931
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,839
process take to develop nature you know

932
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,639
I mean it's you know that's what kind of

933
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:04,759
why I don't doubt it either cuz I mean

934
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,400
it for millions of years this has worked

935
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,280
and like it's like the whole thing is

936
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,720
already

937
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,079
organized yep it's like the um uh soil

938
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:17,078
food web that uh Dr laningham will uh

939
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,920
preach through her different books and

940
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,519
and classes and stuff it it makes a lot

941
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,760
of sense that you have these different

942
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:25,679
processes that have developed over time

943
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,160
to help cycle and process phosphorus and

944
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,639
nitrogen and potassium

945
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,559
and carbon and all these different

946
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:36,480
things that you

947
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:40,358
can like actually now put through that

948
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,599
scientific lens and and explain uh where

949
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:43,358
it's but it's still all those

950
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,920
interactions together are almost harder

951
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,639
to explain as a whole rather than the

952
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,880
each individual processes oh well you

953
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,480
yeah because you look at one part of it

954
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,599
and it's like okay so the plant is going

955
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,000
to you know put carbohydrates into the

956
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,680
soil to attract something you're like oh

957
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,639
that makes sense well then it also does

958
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:01,318
20 other things and there's sugar

959
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:03,920
there's sugar it produces out through

960
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:05,679
the um stamata to keep plant to keep

961
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,920
bugs away that'll kill like it's like

962
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,039
you start looking at all of it you're

963
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:16,159
like this is very well orchestrated it

964
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:18,000
is it is um so back to you building your

965
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,960
your current setup so when you were

966
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,199
building these beds I remember you said

967
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,159
that you had uh a rock layer at the

968
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:25,960
bottom did you layer the pots in any

969
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:27,920
other ways and and did you add anything

970
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,400
else like either on top of the substrate

971
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,680
or within the substrate um to kind of

972
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,000
help with a specific style that you were

973
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:38,279
going for uh yeah so this year which I

974
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,400
normally don't do and I had kind of goes

975
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,480
back in your questions of things that

976
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,440
have mixed results was doing a top a top

977
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,039
dress layer of you know here remember I

978
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,760
have to look at the gra but Clover and

979
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:51,279
some other grasses and some legum some

980
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,000
type of peas to keep the Sun from

981
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,200
beating down on the soil so a lot of the

982
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,119
problem with outdoor growing is that

983
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,719
you're going to have a large pot and

984
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,720
you're going to have it dry from the

985
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,759
bottom up and the top down at the same

986
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,919
time and leave a section in the center

987
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,240
as it's using the water and as the sun's

988
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,240
evaporating the water you're going to

989
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:11,199
end up with you know a dry bottom of

990
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,199
your pot and a dry top of your pot and a

991
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,439
wet Center of your pot which is going to

992
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,239
mean you're going to overwater the

993
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,800
center and to get the bottom wet you're

994
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,159
going to have to really overwater the

995
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,359
center to get the water down to the

996
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,719
bottom of the pot from the top and then

997
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:25,960
you're going to have the top of the pot

998
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:28,318
drying out and killing all of your your

999
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,240
food web roots on the top of the soil

1000
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:32,800
that run about I don't know maybe they

1001
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,559
run a foot deep from the top of the soil

1002
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,359
and so I did a cover crop which worked

1003
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:41,279
extremely well but not thinking about it

1004
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,078
or never done doing it

1005
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,040
before uh it attracts a lot of bugs you

1006
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,039
get a lot of pest brought in cuz there's

1007
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:49,639
a whole like five different food sources

1008
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,519
you just brought onto the scene like

1009
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:54,559
right in the same vicinity of your plant

1010
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,838
which I would do it again if I used

1011
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,519
something that didn't grow as high that

1012
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,239
wouldn't grow up into the bottom of the

1013
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,280
plant and like literally have a ladder

1014
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:04,879
into the into the plant like a climbing

1015
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,440
uh pee or something or yeah you threw up

1016
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,160
you threw up a ladder right up into the

1017
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,400
right up into your bud so that anything

1018
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,199
that walks on the ground can make it up

1019
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,039
in there not that it couldn't before but

1020
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,439
now you know you make it a lot easier

1021
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,559
but it don't really layer the soil I

1022
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,920
just put the soil in I don't have I me

1023
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,119
know a lot of people do super soils

1024
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,318
where we want the bottom of the soil to

1025
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,318
be one thing and the middle to be

1026
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:24,800
another and the top to be another really

1027
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:26,880
just do one soil make sure it's amended

1028
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
well and evenly distributed and then

1029
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,760
I'll do

1030
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,838
I like the idea of straw better on top

1031
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,920
of the pots to you know add that buffer

1032
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:36,440
so they're not getting beaten down by

1033
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,480
the sun like a like a mulch layer like a

1034
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,720
mulch layer or just something you don't

1035
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,358
really want mulch you want something to

1036
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:44,039
inert because you don't want to start

1037
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:45,799
you don't want any biological composting

1038
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,639
process to start on top of your soil cuz

1039
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,240
that's going to be a it's going to be

1040
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:51,879
not be good but yeah like a straw an

1041
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,279
inert straw something that will get wet

1042
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,920
but won't like start to break down and

1043
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,560
decompos in the top just to add a buffer

1044
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,318
for the light or buffer for

1045
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,480
heat

1046
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:02,960
radiation cool kind of kind of helps

1047
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,480
trap in some of the moisture too so

1048
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,039
you're not losing too much through

1049
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,199
evaporation you're losing some

1050
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,759
evaporation and then you're you're

1051
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,960
keeping your soil temps down which I

1052
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,160
mean keeping your soil temp down is kind

1053
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,838
of a lost battle there's only you can

1054
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:17,358
get don't get a black pot and don't let

1055
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,639
the sun touch the top of the soil that's

1056
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:20,920
about all you can do so I mean you can

1057
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:22,400
with outdoor there's only so much you

1058
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,920
can control and you just got to kind of

1059
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,960
figure out what you can it's like the

1060
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,559
was the AA prayer control what you can

1061
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,920
control don't worry about what you can't

1062
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,519
but like figure out what you can do and

1063
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,079
then you got to do that very well fair

1064
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:36,358
enough

1065
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,280
um were there any other things that you

1066
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:40,799
implemented this year that you had in

1067
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,359
years prior that you felt uh was a great

1068
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,119
Improvement to your plants or did you

1069
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,838
add anything that you kind of felt as

1070
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,358
though hindered your ability to tune the

1071
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,039
plants the way that you like to I don't

1072
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:54,039
think that I really did anything to

1073
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:57,000
hinder myself this year other than bad

1074
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,960
strain choices if you saw my pictures I

1075
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,119
had one strain that did phenominally

1076
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,159
well and then I had one strain that I

1077
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,318
was very disappointed in and because it

1078
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,480
couldn't handle heat stress it was

1079
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:10,199
untrainable it just anything that I was

1080
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,000
going to do with it it was not it would

1081
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,039
not take it and then you know at that

1082
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,599
point you just got to let it run you

1083
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,358
know if you try to I I don't like to top

1084
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,880
plants I like to just bend them over and

1085
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:20,920
get new shoots to come off I feel like

1086
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,640
when you top them it it kills your yield

1087
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,960
and it kind of it sets the plant back

1088
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,960
about a week or so if you're going to

1089
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,880
cut on it so if you are going to top it

1090
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,079
you want to top it before you planted in

1091
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,000
there but strain Choice Outdoors is it's

1092
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,280
massive like you can get one like I had

1093
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,480
one that just you know and then you have

1094
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,640
half your garden set on that and you're

1095
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,599
like you're okay with it but I mean it's

1096
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,920
certain point you can't do anything

1097
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,800
about it yeah I agree

1098
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,838
it we we've even just stopped even doing

1099
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,560
any training on outdoor plants um I mean

1100
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:53,799
especially cuz they're in rows and you

1101
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,519
have you know 30 or 40 plants per row it

1102
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,640
it doesn't really make too much sense to

1103
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,480
just to try and even the canopy it kind

1104
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:03,078
of becomes a hedge either way have more

1105
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,000
surface area too if it's not even right

1106
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:07,960
absolutely you have PE Peaks and valleys

1107
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,519
versus a flat plane always has more

1108
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,119
surface area that's the same reason why

1109
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,039
we we tend to not top indoors either is

1110
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,000
because if you have a a completely even

1111
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:18,838
canopy in a 4x4 area then you only have

1112
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,280
16 square ft of available surface area

1113
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:23,480
directly down from the light but if you

1114
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:27,319
have Peaks and valleys you can sometimes

1115
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:29,119
uh one and 1/2x to double your total

1116
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:33,480
surface area which just means more

1117
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,960
Photon absorption so um that's a it's a

1118
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,358
great point for people to think about

1119
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,559
when you do have the outdoors though

1120
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:43,279
where the sun as a single point um but

1121
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,559
spread across such a large surface area

1122
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,440
at a such high ppfd and the fact that it

1123
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,239
moves across the sky you have this

1124
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,720
ability to really capture light uh on

1125
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,039
almost all different sides of the plant

1126
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,719
especially when you're down in like

1127
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,679
California not too high on the latitudes

1128
00:41:55,719 --> 00:42:00,399
um you get a lot of that really nice

1129
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,960
light um and so it almost feels like you

1130
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,358
could top it you could spread it out you

1131
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,440
could do whatever you want with it if

1132
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:06,679
they're not growing directly next to

1133
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,200
each other they're going to

1134
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:12,239
capture you know a ton of a ton of

1135
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,358
energy from the Sun oh 100% like that's

1136
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,039
I've noticed I have a tree that

1137
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,039
overhangs one part of my garden and

1138
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,719
around high noon so whenever the

1139
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:22,199
brightest of the day between about 12:

1140
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:24,480
and 1:32 p.m it blocks a couple of the

1141
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,799
plants off and you notice the quality of

1142
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,358
the butt on those plants will be a

1143
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,920
little bit higher and the yield is going

1144
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,119
be lower but like right when right when

1145
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,400
the ppfd is going to be too high is I

1146
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,760
want to say too high but you know

1147
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,039
extremely high if you can block that off

1148
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,480
and that's like a lot of the the

1149
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:41,159
advantage of a greenhouse is that you're

1150
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,519
you're taking that and lowering it down

1151
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,118
a little bit and your quality is going

1152
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:47,719
up sure you're making like a more even

1153
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,079
spread of the light at a lower intensity

1154
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,000
rather than that sort of high peak

1155
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,960
intensity of the midday and low

1156
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,800
intensity of the morning and afternoon

1157
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,639
um% yeah so um

1158
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,318
out of all the aspects of your gardening

1159
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,118
nowadays what do you think is one of the

1160
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:05,960
most important things that you do in

1161
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,680
your garden um that you might not have

1162
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,039
touched on so far or if you've already

1163
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,440
touched on it um maybe dive a little bit

1164
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:14,960
deeper into its importance to your

1165
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,480
gardening

1166
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,159
um say watering is probably going to be

1167
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,400
your biggest factor in anything if

1168
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,960
you're not watering correctly that

1169
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,400
anything else you do is going to be it

1170
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,079
starts with watering everything is to to

1171
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:31,519
be n and void so really keeping an eye

1172
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,519
on how much water your plants are using

1173
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,079
and how much is evaporating is going to

1174
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:38,318
be a huge Factor because that's

1175
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,599
especially I want to say organic because

1176
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:41,679
you're going to your microbes are going

1177
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,079
to die if you get it too dry and they're

1178
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,000
going to die if it's too wet and you're

1179
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,680
going to get mold if it's too wet you're

1180
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,920
going to get fungus and root Rod if it's

1181
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:53,598
too wet so that is like if you have a

1182
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,680
good soil and you can keep the water in

1183
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,160
the pot at the exact level you want the

1184
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,118
amount of moisture you're going to have

1185
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,838
the best results by far for sure what

1186
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,240
what are some of your watering practices

1187
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,279
like what are some of the Tells that you

1188
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,838
look for and what are some of the other

1189
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,680
insights you might be able to to share

1190
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,400
with other outdoor Growers that might be

1191
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:15,759
looking into doing something in these

1192
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,599
larger um raised pots where you have a

1193
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,640
because you have like a like Matrix

1194
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,519
potential would be something where

1195
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:24,078
you're actually using soil sand silt and

1196
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:26,440
Clay where the water availability is

1197
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:29,800
dependent upon that Matrix potential

1198
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:32,880
whereas within uh substrate you have uh

1199
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,240
osmotic potential and you actually have

1200
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,400
um water available within the poe space

1201
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:39,679
of these substrates that are made out of

1202
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,559
a it's like a soiless media where you

1203
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:45,000
don't have sand Sil or clay um yeah so

1204
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:48,640
what are some of these practices that

1205
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,920
you do with uh your your substrate and

1206
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,039
if you could also just really quick

1207
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,519
touch on what what substrate did you use

1208
00:44:53,039 --> 00:45:00,519
for these 200 gon pots I used vital

1209
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:02,000
Earths blend of soil Co which is um it's

1210
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:04,519
pretty good soil I've never used it

1211
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,519
before it is a little bit pricey because

1212
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:08,159
they are uh they're proud of themselves

1213
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,480
and not in a negative way but you know

1214
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:13,000
Vital Earth is you know is kind of a poh

1215
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,838
brand sure their soil is the only soil

1216
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,679
you can find that doesn't have any dairy

1217
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,759
manure any dairy anything related to

1218
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:22,480
Dairy farming in it which is a one of

1219
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,720
the big things because Dairy farming and

1220
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,599
the byproducts of it are not nice at all

1221
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,719
when you start looking into that um

1222
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,640
but I did that and as far as watering

1223
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:34,598
goes is

1224
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:35,960
that you want to water you want to water

1225
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,119
every day you don't want to not water

1226
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,358
every day if you're if

1227
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:42,119
you're if you're not watering for four

1228
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:45,159
days at a time there's a problem and if

1229
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,838
you're watering every day and it's dry

1230
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,199
every day that's also a problem you want

1231
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:50,838
to get to the Fine medium where you're

1232
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:53,118
watering every day to keep it

1233
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:54,519
so I don't use a moisture meter so I

1234
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,240
have no way to tell you how to like

1235
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,639
verify this but wherever you're water

1236
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:00,318
level wherever your moisture level you

1237
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,799
want it to be you wanted to drop down a

1238
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:03,279
little bit every day and bring it back

1239
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,200
up a little bit past that every day and

1240
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,240
you want to keep it in this range cuz if

1241
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,000
you let your soil go all dry if you let

1242
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:10,799
your soil dry out it's going to become

1243
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,760
hydrophobic and that's going to make it

1244
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,599
really hard to water it and get it wet

1245
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,839
in the next day or two without having to

1246
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:17,920
like literally run water through the pot

1247
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:19,480
until it's coming out the bottom and

1248
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,318
even then you might have dry Pockets

1249
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,119
within there for sure you're going to

1250
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:24,880
get like channeling and stuff as well

1251
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,000
you get channeling or you can like you

1252
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,200
can think that the pot is full of water

1253
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
you stick your you can like stick your

1254
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:32,279
hand down in there and you'll find just

1255
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,358
dry there'll just be dry areas in there

1256
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,040
where it doesn't get wet so once you let

1257
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:39,159
it get past the point of being too dry

1258
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:42,000
it's going to be hard to get it as a

1259
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:43,639
hole back to where you want it to go for

1260
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,239
sure it it kind of makes me think of a

1261
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:47,838
Sarcan Rhythm where you really want like

1262
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,879
because the plants kind of have this

1263
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:52,639
24-hour cycle just like humans do where

1264
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,640
you have the sun coming up and going

1265
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:57,598
down and it it's something that has just

1266
00:46:54,639 --> 00:47:01,118
sort of genetically been embedded in our

1267
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,720
code um following that with plants does

1268
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,000
help it seems with their overall health

1269
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:10,480
rather than having these extremely long

1270
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,559
points of of drying and then High

1271
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,240
irrigation you know you you can run into

1272
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:16,800
like hypoxia events or stuff at at that

1273
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:19,838
point as well too where you have too

1274
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,400
much water in the substrate um but yeah

1275
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:24,719
finding that perfect sort of balance

1276
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,720
within the sub sound very lame and on

1277
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:27,558
here but it's hard to explain if you're

1278
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:28,799
not using a moisture meter cu can't say

1279
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:29,880
like it needs to be here it needs to go

1280
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,960
there it needs to go there it's kind of

1281
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,358
all played by ear and like you I

1282
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,679
explaining it would be easier in person

1283
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,078
to show you what I mean but another

1284
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,279
thing too about that

1285
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,760
is if you go out at night and your soil

1286
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,839
feels dry and you go out in the morning

1287
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,319
and your soil looks wet the amount of

1288
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:50,000
water that the plant is dumping back

1289
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:51,759
into the soil at night can also trick

1290
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,838
you too because if the soil is dry at

1291
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,280
night and it's wet in the morning it's

1292
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:56,880
not wet all the way through the pot you

1293
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,680
still need to water it but the amount of

1294
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,960
water that is up in the plant that comes

1295
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:01,598
down when it goes to I don't want to say

1296
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,318
goes to sleep but when it goes to sleep

1297
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,280
is a there going to be a lot of volume

1298
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:06,719
especially with a large Plant so you got

1299
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,200
to be careful not to get tricked by that

1300
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,558
because if you go out you know at you

1301
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,759
know in the evening before the sun goes

1302
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,880
down and you're like oh these need water

1303
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,240
you go out in the morning they look like

1304
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,760
they don't need water they still need

1305
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:17,879
water for sure yeah you get a lot of um

1306
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,720
condensation to on the top of soil just

1307
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,400
from the the temperature change from

1308
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:23,919
night to day and uh yeah I've definitely

1309
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,440
seen that where it looks like it's fine

1310
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,880
and then all of a sudden it's starting

1311
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,800
to look drought stressed with some

1312
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,800
wilting leaves or perhaps some you know

1313
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,119
red pedals or uh you know yellowing

1314
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,240
around the fringes or some other sort of

1315
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:39,760
high EC osmotic stress that you might

1316
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,719
see you start seeing like the bottom

1317
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,000
start to yellow out and yellow from the

1318
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:47,558
you know you'll start yeah 100%

1319
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,079
right I feel like another another really

1320
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:51,280
good point to bring up especially when

1321
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:53,000
you are running a a heavily amended

1322
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,880
substrate that you're using that

1323
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,280
biological activity that by maintaining

1324
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,920
a certain moisture

1325
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,680
content you're also maintaining the

1326
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,280
health of the biology within the pot uh

1327
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:08,399
for those nutrient cycling processes to

1328
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,040
continue to occur at a you know a

1329
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,200
healthy rate rather than booms and busts

1330
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:18,000
um because that can cause some some

1331
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:20,039
burning or uh nutrient imbalances i'

1332
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,358
I've seen as well or you can kill off

1333
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:22,639
part of your roots I mean your roots

1334
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,558
will go Brown in different areas of the

1335
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,199
poth which you won't see or if you start

1336
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,599
yeah another thing too a good way to

1337
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:29,838
gauge it too is is if you have fungus

1338
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,960
growth in your pots and you can maintain

1339
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:33,639
fungus growth like Fruity and bodies

1340
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,838
that's how you know you kind of hit like

1341
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:37,798
the perfect

1342
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:39,318
Zone that's a really great Point yeah

1343
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:41,039
but if you can have fruy mushrooms in

1344
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:42,838
the pots and you can keep them alive and

1345
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,000
they keep fruiting over and over again

1346
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:46,960
you you know you're like right where you

1347
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,639
need to be cuz you can use that as a

1348
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,838
gauge to to the whole the whole soil

1349
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:54,039
Health as a whole you know that's a

1350
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:57,159
that's a really good way to sort of

1351
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:00,759
explain it for anybody that's grown say

1352
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:03,039
um mushrooms because when you make your

1353
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,280
grains for the different mushrooms like

1354
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:08,920
oyster mushrooms or shitake mushrooms or

1355
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,519
any edible mushrooms let's say and you

1356
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,318
you take those grains and you either

1357
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:14,639
steam them or you cook them you don't

1358
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,558
cook them until they're mush and and and

1359
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,000
wet and sopping and soaking where you

1360
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,839
can take a handful of them and squeeze

1361
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,358
them and water comes out you cook them

1362
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,798
until they're just cooked enough or

1363
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:27,920
there's enough water content within them

1364
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:30,239
so that the melal colonies can kind of

1365
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,720
take hold colonize those different

1366
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,759
grains and then you can produce those

1367
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:35,439
fruiting bodies from them because the

1368
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,040
fuing bodies yes they do contain a lot

1369
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,400
of moisture but they pull a lot of that

1370
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:42,358
moisture from this the substrate block

1371
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,838
and um you'll see the whole block kind

1372
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:47,400
of shrivel up a after the mycelium sort

1373
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:49,759
of consumes it and the fruiting bodies

1374
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,920
Sprout um so that's a really good point

1375
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,480
because yeah you don't want it to be

1376
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,159
mush where it's really wet it can't be

1377
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,440
dry because then you don't have the

1378
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:59,318
ability for the melal col to take hold

1379
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,358
of it it has to be just right it's like

1380
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:02,838
a kind of like a goldilock Zone some

1381
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,639
people call it it is kind of like and

1382
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:06,759
then like for a I don't know how you say

1383
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,440
it it's like a it's the canary and the

1384
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,880
coal Coal Mine so to speak in a

1385
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,838
different way but if you have rooing

1386
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,480
bodies you know like you hit where you

1387
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,558
need to be cuz if they can live and the

1388
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,559
melum can expand and they can fruit and

1389
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:19,400
they're not getting overwatered to where

1390
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:21,079
they turn brown and die and you see new

1391
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,160
fruiting bodies coming up you know

1392
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:25,960
constantly every couple days now you

1393
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:27,920
know like your whole your soil food web

1394
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,639
is you where is the best you're going to

1395
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,920
get for sure it's like U some people

1396
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:37,039
will call like the melal structure the

1397
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,599
roots of mushrooms where like using it

1398
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:41,440
as an analogy for plants and their roots

1399
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,240
and in using that analogy they're not

1400
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,838
wrong in some aspects where the moisture

1401
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:50,879
content for uh healthy myal production

1402
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:53,759
is the roughly the same moisture content

1403
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,000
required for healthy root production um

1404
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,799
and root health so that's a that's a

1405
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,880
really good anal ology to to bring up to

1406
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:01,440
people who have either one experience or

1407
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,680
the other that they can then apply that

1408
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,400
to yeah and it's like and yeah and then

1409
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:09,000
it's easy to like for an obice approach

1410
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,400
too because if you can see that like

1411
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,039
that's you don't need to know anything

1412
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,720
like if you don't know anything that is

1413
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:16,079
like that's your sign like you know that

1414
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:17,480
you're golden there once you've hit that

1415
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,440
for sure also then you get into like

1416
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,358
what kind of like I think I have Shaggy

1417
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,318
parasols that come into the pots and I

1418
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,598
don't know if they're necessarily

1419
00:52:23,318 --> 00:52:28,558
from spores that are on the property or

1420
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,160
from the soil I put in but I had or

1421
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,720
something some amendment I use I don't

1422
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:33,920
know exactly where they came from but I

1423
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:36,558
have the same fru in bodies every year

1424
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,838
even when I soils same Fring bodies and

1425
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,440
you've been able to identify them as to

1426
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:42,679
what they are I'm not I'm no I'm no

1427
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,960
micro expert but I have got on some

1428
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:45,358
reddits and that's what I've been told

1429
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,760
multiple times that they kind of fit I

1430
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:48,400
haven't tooken a Spore print or gone

1431
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,520
into all that but I kind of assume

1432
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,760
that's what they are that's kind of what

1433
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:53,639
I've been led to believe for sure you

1434
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,160
should you should see if there's like um

1435
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:59,159
I know some uh like mushroom uction

1436
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:00,960
companies like if they make a bunch of

1437
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:03,838
shiitake mushrooms or other things like

1438
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,079
that they'll sell their uh fru blocks

1439
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:08,199
afterwards as mushroom compost and I've

1440
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,760
seen people take those and put them into

1441
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:15,358
highly active substrates and then get

1442
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,640
more fruiting Cycles out of it umw where

1443
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,838
you can then you know go through and

1444
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,318
harvest a bunch of shitake and stuff or

1445
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:22,480
oyster mushrooms or whatever it is that

1446
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:23,519
they have growing on them well then two

1447
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,480
another thing to think about are they

1448
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,838
Endo or Ecto micro isal like how are

1449
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,119
they going to interact with your too

1450
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:34,039
yeah I you'd have to look into the the

1451
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:35,838
specific type of uh um of mushroom that

1452
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:38,079
it is and and how that's going to

1453
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,400
interact with the plant I you know some

1454
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,839
of them I know that there are some

1455
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:46,358
mushrooms that are

1456
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:48,639
um I forget the the exact term but

1457
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:51,598
they're basically some of them really

1458
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:55,960
like dung or or manure and some of them

1459
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:59,480
like uh rotted Uh Wood like oh um it's

1460
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,920
like Nile seor

1461
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:06,358
yood kind yep so there's like one's for

1462
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:08,079
rotting wood one's for digested organic

1463
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,679
matter and

1464
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,079
um yeah you would you'd have to wonder

1465
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:15,798
is it going to be beneficial in a root

1466
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:17,079
Zone where like if if it recognizes the

1467
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:21,599
roots

1468
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:22,880
as uh if it is soric I'm listeners

1469
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,720
forgive us if we aren't using the

1470
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,880
correct terms but if it likes if it

1471
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,358
likes wood or lignan and it is going

1472
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,880
after the roots is it going to go after

1473
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:33,400
roots that are dead uh is it going to

1474
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,920
cause a disease to the roots that are

1475
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,880
going to cause them to die or is it

1476
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,920
going to leave the live Roots alone and

1477
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:43,039
remove the dead root tissue and

1478
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:46,519
potentially even provide some sort of

1479
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:47,960
um agent taking up whatever whatever is

1480
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:49,239
in the compost or whatever is already in

1481
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,119
the soil and turning it into something

1482
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:53,679
that it can use yeah absolutely you so

1483
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:55,400
many of these different interactions I

1484
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:57,039
feel like there's probably studies out

1485
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,599
there that have some of this information

1486
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:02,838
in there um so whoever finds that out

1487
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,760
please let us know um but this is It's a

1488
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:05,759
fascinating conversation to think and

1489
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,920
that's like if you want to get into

1490
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,799
compost te's a lot more which is a step

1491
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,280
I haven't gone is like getting a

1492
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:13,759
microscope and looking at what you have

1493
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,680
and every tea you have Y which is which

1494
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,520
is a step further than you know most

1495
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,358
most hom Growers or most anybody who's

1496
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,880
like I mean if that's your profession I

1497
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,318
could see why you how you have the time

1498
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,640
and the ability to do these things and

1499
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,920
it's kind of nice to know not really

1500
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:27,440
need to know but I mean taking your tea

1501
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,639
and testing every te you have and being

1502
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,519
like okay well you know when I this is

1503
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:33,480
my ingredients I use and the times I use

1504
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:35,559
and the temperatures it was I'm getting

1505
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,519
a higher result out of that than I am if

1506
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:39,000
I do it you know you know you can play

1507
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,239
it by year at home but like when you

1508
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,280
really get it down and start doing the

1509
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:46,078
science on it like you could probably

1510
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:47,920
find tun a t to be pretty pretty good

1511
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,760
probably and and a lot of it would then

1512
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,680
have to do with where you're sourcing

1513
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,799
your um microbial and biological

1514
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:57,399
consortiums and what you're feeding it

1515
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,358
and if those different constituents

1516
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,119
change throughout the seasons as well

1517
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:03,920
like if you're using a like let's say

1518
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,599
you you make your own Co compost and

1519
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,440
you're using compost that you make all

1520
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,599
year and it's from your kitchen scrap

1521
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,358
well is your kitchen scrap based on

1522
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:15,880
seasonally available produce and if so

1523
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:18,279
does that produce have a higher you know

1524
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:21,798
because it's going to be cores of apple

1525
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,839
peels of banana uh shoots of broccoli

1526
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:26,759
kale whatever these things are eggshells

1527
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:30,838
coffee grounds whatever is that you're

1528
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:33,720
having right and you know based on

1529
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:35,838
those like I'm I'm pretty sure potassium

1530
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:38,519
is going to be high in banana peels so

1531
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:40,639
are are you heavier in potassium or are

1532
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:43,280
you heavier in something that's like oh

1533
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:45,759
I had a bunch of dead and

1534
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,240
dying blackberries on my bush and I

1535
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,760
threw those in there and so you're going

1536
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:50,759
to have a bunch of phosphorus from the

1537
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:54,880
seeds of the of the blackberries and

1538
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:58,520
stuff um like what what's the makeup of

1539
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:01,160
the compost how is this biology going to

1540
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:04,358
affect it and the source of the biology

1541
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:06,399
where is that coming from oh 100%

1542
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:09,358
another thing I think about too which is

1543
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,838
I don't really know like so you have all

1544
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:14,239
your different micro risal like that you

1545
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:15,798
can use like obviously you can buy a

1546
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,399
million off the store like whatever off

1547
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:20,639
the shelf okay when you colonize your

1548
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,079
pot with one and then you want to use

1549
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,679
another later in the year can it out

1550
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:26,519
compete the one you've already colonized

1551
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:28,078
your pot with because you have I mean I

1552
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:29,798
see a lot of I don't want to say Kimi

1553
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,519
but it's like can't remember the name

1554
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:34,880
they have a product makeup F and it has

1555
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:36,599
a special type of basilis in there or uh

1556
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,680
but do you know that that's going to out

1557
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:39,760
compete what you already have in your

1558
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:41,440
pot or are you just throwing you know

1559
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,079
like do you already have the a whole

1560
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,720
colony in 200 gallons and you're trying

1561
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:46,680
to recolonize it half through the year

1562
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,399
isn't even doing anything cuz I mean if

1563
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:49,838
you lab test it and it does process

1564
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,200
phosphorus that doesn't mean you're

1565
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:53,119
going to get it colonize and already

1566
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:55,078
colonized pot and that's like a lot of

1567
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,358
like what I haven't seen research being

1568
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:58,280
done is like you know if you're going to

1569
00:57:56,358 --> 00:58:00,119
colonize your pot one in the beginning

1570
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,640
are you ever going to be able to change

1571
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:03,680
the composition of what's living in

1572
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:05,879
there you know and try to recolonize it

1573
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:08,000
with something else for sure the first

1574
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:12,000
thing that comes to mind uh about like

1575
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,400
that out compet out competing of one uh

1576
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,960
either let's say it's a melal colony um

1577
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,920
you you know you may have like an endom

1578
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,119
micro isal fungi within your soil that's

1579
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:26,760
helping provide some benefit between the

1580
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:29,039
uh roots and the the rest of the soil um

1581
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,559
but then if you introduce trichoderma

1582
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:34,599
you're going to decimate that population

1583
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:37,079
of micro isal fungi and it's going to

1584
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:38,760
way out compete it but it's also then

1585
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:41,119
going to provide its own benefits to the

1586
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,440
plant not necessarily in nutrient

1587
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:47,240
exchange but in protection from like

1588
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:52,480
ferium pythium other uh

1589
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:54,639
negative um uh pathogens and uh rootborn

1590
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,960
diseases

1591
00:58:54,639 --> 00:59:00,318
so what what's the approach that you

1592
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,920
need to take I think is really truly uh

1593
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:04,519
subjective in a lot of these different

1594
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,639
cases based on what you have available

1595
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:11,519
and what your the pressures are on your

1596
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:12,798
um your system oh 100% yeah that's just

1597
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,079
that's just kind of things I think about

1598
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:16,759
going forward is like I trying to get to

1599
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:18,400
the point where I know these where you

1600
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,680
can know these differences but it's very

1601
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,760
hard it's it's not easy to do no and

1602
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:25,358
like you even said you know you're

1603
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,880
especially as an outdoor grower your

1604
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:30,038
knowledge is built up season to season

1605
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,599
rather than grow to grow where I mean it

1606
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:33,359
is grow to grow but you have to look at

1607
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,559
it as this season to season thing

1608
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,000
because you have one opportunity one

1609
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:38,519
yeah it's one opportunity per year

1610
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,199
unless you're doing some sort of light

1611
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:43,920
depth setup but then you have a uh a

1612
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:45,919
greenhouse basically and you need to

1613
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,798
manage that completely differently than

1614
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,318
in your outdoor setup um what for your

1615
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,719
outdoor you know one of the things that

1616
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:55,719
you touched on briefly earlier is that

1617
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:58,399
integrated Pest Management is very

1618
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:00,078
important important because you only

1619
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,559
have one crop per year that you get to

1620
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:05,280
work with and if you're using this as

1621
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:07,760
medicine or even as a recreational um

1622
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,240
thing it the importance of making sure

1623
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:15,400
that you make it through to harvest with

1624
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:17,439
a limited crop per year is dire so it's

1625
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,318
dire and it you know and not not too

1626
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,480
negatively touch on it is like that's

1627
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:23,880
what that's why I think outdoor gets a

1628
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,440
bad WAP is cuz some people will do

1629
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,160
whatever they have to do to make it get

1630
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,440
to the end instead of doing what's right

1631
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:33,480
and the hard way to get it to the end

1632
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:35,079
but yes uh IPM is figuring out your IPM

1633
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,240
is going to be something you need to do

1634
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:39,480
within the first year or two because if

1635
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,679
you don't figure it out by then you're

1636
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,798
never going to have sub you know good

1637
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:46,279
years after that like that's like a you

1638
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:47,798
got to figure that out and you got to

1639
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,559
probably talk if you don't know someone

1640
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:51,199
who's watching that doesn't know talk to

1641
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:54,039
somebody who does know and at least

1642
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:56,639
start with somebody somebody IPM that

1643
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:57,880
they've kind of created cuz if go out

1644
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:58,920
without knowing what you're doing you're

1645
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,519
going to have it's going to you're going

1646
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,119
to have a bad time for sure what what

1647
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,719
are some experiences that you've had

1648
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,400
with IPM applications um knowing that we

1649
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:10,038
can't necessarily tell other people how

1650
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:13,400
to apply their own ipms but um in terms

1651
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:15,160
of where you found success with a um

1652
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:19,680
let's say an early detection that you

1653
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:21,440
were able to eradicate and then um

1654
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:23,318
perhaps something that maybe got out of

1655
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,358
control that you weren't necessarily

1656
01:01:23,318 --> 01:01:29,119
able to fight back within that specific

1657
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:32,679
season where it did then negatively a

1658
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:36,280
affect your yields so when I look at IPM

1659
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:38,798
and doing organic and not using any non

1660
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,599
approved sprays like so even spinoid is

1661
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:41,920
not approved in California anymore even

1662
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,318
though it is organic so you got to look

1663
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,240
at like I'm very very religious on not

1664
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:47,759
using anything that has any sort of

1665
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:49,959
negative effect on human health that has

1666
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,319
been proven sure

1667
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,880
so and when you're looking at an outdoor

1668
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:56,759
sense it's not I'm never going to get

1669
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,119
bugs it's like you are going to get

1670
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,520
something and you need to know that it

1671
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:01,519
is going to happen and what you want to

1672
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:04,559
do is get in place an IPM that is going

1673
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:06,440
to slow it's going to reduce the chance

1674
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,798
of it happening and if it does happen

1675
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,760
slow it down so you have time to react

1676
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:14,519
i' I've heard it referred to as uh

1677
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:16,240
achieving an economic threshold uh yes

1678
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:18,119
there's going to be pressure and pre and

1679
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,919
there's going to be pest pressure but

1680
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,680
you need to keep it very very low and

1681
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,838
keep control of it because you're never

1682
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:25,038
going to have it's out the plant's

1683
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:26,358
outside you're never going to not have

1684
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:28,520
bugs

1685
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:30,880
to say that I never had bugs this year

1686
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:32,679
is that's untruth like did you did you

1687
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,039
control it and did you go a good job and

1688
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:36,679
not have any negative effects from it

1689
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,839
yes did you not have any bugs on your

1690
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:40,960
plants no because I even use beneficial

1691
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,639
insects like we have Green Lace Wing

1692
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,880
here that come around naturally on the

1693
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:47,199
plants there's ladybug larva there's

1694
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,440
assassin bugs there's stuff that like so

1695
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:49,558
you're going to have bugs on your plants

1696
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,838
that aren't bad that you're going to

1697
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:53,880
want there so it's like kind of managing

1698
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:56,880
that and trying to fix pick something

1699
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,680
that is going to keep the pressure at

1700
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,838
Bay and allow you to make a choice and

1701
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:02,118
that's why I saying earlier so I like to

1702
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:04,278
use my own Bio Innovations they have you

1703
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:06,240
know Grand Evo and venerate which are

1704
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:08,559
two really good sprays that if you're

1705
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,078
going to be consistent and use them work

1706
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,000
very well but they are not going to save

1707
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,079
you by any means like if you if you go

1708
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,278
out and you weren't doing anything and

1709
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:16,760
you see that problem like there's only a

1710
01:03:15,278 --> 01:03:18,199
few products that you can use that are

1711
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,319
going to be organic and safe that are

1712
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:22,000
actually going to help you and they're

1713
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:23,159
going to be contact sprays at best like

1714
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,039
you're going to have to go out and do it

1715
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:26,920
religiously to bring the pressure back

1716
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,599
down to where you want to to be so I'd

1717
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,440
say being on top of that and figuring

1718
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:33,760
out a cycle of three products you want

1719
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:36,599
to use so when I'm in veg I use a

1720
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,680
mixture of mineral oil I'll use Grand

1721
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:40,640
Divo and vener and then when I get into

1722
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:43,000
start going into flow I'll pull the oils

1723
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:45,118
out so I won't use any mineral oil

1724
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,838
stylid oil if I was going to use neem

1725
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,079
oil I won't use that anymore or if you

1726
01:03:46,838 --> 01:03:50,159
are going to use neem oil you're going

1727
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,000
to back that out and then I found

1728
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,598
another product I can't remember the

1729
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,079
name of it but it's basically sugars

1730
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,599
that they found that plants Prett on

1731
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,480
their own and they synthesize them and

1732
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:04,640
they're so like a different type of

1733
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:07,400
sucos guard huh is it on guard Ong guard

1734
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:09,639
or it's called regalia or you said

1735
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,599
regalia right no I don't really use

1736
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:13,278
regalia okay I was thinking about using

1737
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,000
it but that's more of a that's more to

1738
01:04:13,278 --> 01:04:19,000
trigger a plant immune response to like

1739
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,480
funguses and stuff but

1740
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,039
um I'll think of the name or I'll grab

1741
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,760
it in a minute but anyway you're going

1742
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,599
to move into keep using your venerate

1743
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:29,000
your grand Evo and then move into a

1744
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,240
contact spray that you're going to want

1745
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,400
to spray every 3 or 4 days CU you're

1746
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:34,719
just going to at a certain point you're

1747
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,079
just going to say I assume that I have

1748
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:38,118
pests and I'm going to spray for them

1749
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,119
and you have to be religious about

1750
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:42,119
it right and then you follow that

1751
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:43,519
through and then right about flour like

1752
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:47,318
right when you get into like the last

1753
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:50,119
two weeks you need to as hard as it is

1754
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:53,358
to do you're going to need to spray for

1755
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:54,039
Caterpillar still which is going to be

1756
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:56,480
um

1757
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:58,278
BT as much as I as much as nobody

1758
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,838
outdoor wants as much as nobody wants to

1759
01:04:58,278 --> 01:05:03,119
spray their butt with anything however

1760
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:04,880
safe it is if you don't I feel like the

1761
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,960
consequences of having caterpillars and

1762
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,119
having caterpillar excrement and having

1763
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:13,318
mold and all that is way out way more

1764
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:17,680
harmful than having sprayed with BT yeah

1765
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:22,400
personal opion basilis sensus is not uh

1766
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:24,399
a harsh uh biology that would then

1767
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,639
negatively affect the end User it's it

1768
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,079
doesn't produce MotoX or anything like

1769
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:31,159
that that would affect um someone

1770
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:34,039
whether it be through consumption uh

1771
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:35,440
through combustion vaporization or um

1772
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:38,278
turning it into it like a tincture

1773
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:41,278
edible or otherwise um and that's that's

1774
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:44,960
been proven through its application on

1775
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:47,039
you know numerous crops uh that have the

1776
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,358
potential for caterpillars um you know

1777
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,119
it makes me think of a lot of like

1778
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:53,598
different brassas uh such as cauliflower

1779
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,160
cabbage uh brussels sprouts all those

1780
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:58,278
different things that you need to have

1781
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,480
something like that sprayed into them or

1782
01:05:58,278 --> 01:06:02,920
else you are going to lose 50% of your

1783
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,719
crop each year oh you are and then the

1784
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,480
then the the negative for ramifications

1785
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:08,879
of having mold in there like so I don't

1786
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,039
know about cauliflower but cannabis you

1787
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,000
don't want to take anything into the

1788
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:13,920
drying room that has mold in it cuz now

1789
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,798
you have a sealed environment where you

1790
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,639
just have where if you don't have

1791
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:18,960
control over your if you get any spikes

1792
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:21,239
and humidity you're just you're

1793
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,880
literally creating a culture like a pet

1794
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:26,479
Tre dish in there to spread mold to

1795
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,960
everything and so like caterpillars is

1796
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,440
like I mean I hate caterpillars and I'm

1797
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,519
sure every outdoor grower can say the

1798
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,720
exact same thing but like if you think

1799
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:35,159
you're spraying too early for

1800
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:37,919
caterpillars when it comes to flour

1801
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:41,960
you're not just just go ahead and do it

1802
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:45,200
for sure um since you do hang a lot of

1803
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:48,440
your end product outdoor for uh smokable

1804
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:50,639
flour as well as for concentrates um do

1805
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:55,358
you end up doing any sort of washes on

1806
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:57,838
your flow to move remove um dust debris

1807
01:06:55,358 --> 01:07:00,519
uh insect droppings carcasses or

1808
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,318
otherwise I do not and I've thought

1809
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:05,079
about doing it I haven't tested it yet

1810
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:07,960
I've heard mixed results I just don't

1811
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:09,519
know it it would probably depend on how

1812
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,920
dry it is when you're harvesting cuz if

1813
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,400
you've already had your plants outside

1814
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,240
and 80% humidity every morning for 2

1815
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,559
weeks and then you duck them in a bucket

1816
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:19,239
of water and then put them in the drying

1817
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,839
room I I haven't tried this but I have a

1818
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:23,439
feeling from past experience that you're

1819
01:07:20,838 --> 01:07:25,558
going to have a bad time yeah I don't I

1820
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,000
don't see that turning out too good yeah

1821
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:28,519
yeah and I'm not against washing it I

1822
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,798
don't think it's a bad idea by any means

1823
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:31,000
but if you're if you're going to destroy

1824
01:07:29,798 --> 01:07:33,880
everything and not have anything at the

1825
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,239
end then you know people who smoke

1826
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,798
outdoor you know what

1827
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:40,479
comes absolutely I feel like there's a

1828
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:42,920
you know there's a little bit of a charm

1829
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:46,358
to outdoor Bud that you know it has so

1830
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:50,000
much more characteristic to it let's say

1831
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:51,880
um and regardless if that's due to the

1832
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,358
extra stuff that comes along with it you

1833
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,798
know it's been something that people

1834
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:59,639
have used for

1835
01:07:55,798 --> 01:08:01,559
centuries thousands of years um and the

1836
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:05,519
fact that we now have

1837
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:09,519
these pampered pallets of indoor

1838
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:12,798
cannabis uh in climate environmentally

1839
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:16,198
controlled sort of uh clean rooms in

1840
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:18,798
some filtered water never sees anything

1841
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:20,238
other than fil yeah I mean I'm not and I

1842
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,359
love that and that's awesome that we do

1843
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:25,039
that but also you can't throw everything

1844
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,480
that got to that point out and they say

1845
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:28,960
like you know well outdoors in the past

1846
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:30,919
you know I feel like a lot of people do

1847
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,920
that and a lot of people newer

1848
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,798
Generations especially that haven't been

1849
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:37,119
around a while like I know people that

1850
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:39,238
I've like talked to that don't know what

1851
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:41,679
brick weed is for sure that don't know

1852
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:43,519
like don't like they you've lost this

1853
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,798
idea of what weed is came and like now

1854
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,719
it's just all indoor and there's nothing

1855
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:49,880
that everything before it doesn't exist

1856
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:55,198
right absolutely I mean and in some

1857
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:56,640
senses it it'll never go back so um well

1858
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,719
maybe maybe I shouldn't speak so soon on

1859
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:02,440
that who knows maybe it'll go back to

1860
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:05,439
something that's less than uh quality

1861
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:07,678
uh depending on how things change if

1862
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:09,278
Federal legalization ever goes through

1863
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,838
but oh well I don't want to think about

1864
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,920
that but yeah I get what you're saying

1865
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:18,759
no we don't want to talk about Philip

1866
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:22,039
Reynolds right now um so with

1867
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:24,520
uh with the fact that you do you know uh

1868
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:26,640
save a lot of your flour for both um

1869
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:28,239
dried flour it is and then you do a lot

1870
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,520
of it seems like you do a lot of

1871
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:34,838
concentrates as well um what have been

1872
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:38,040
some of your your U most memorable

1873
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:41,198
harvests uh as both flour and

1874
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:43,238
concentrate most memorable Harvest so at

1875
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:46,119
this property I'd say this year as far

1876
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:48,119
as flow and concentrates go the

1877
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:49,119
governmental Wast I grew did phenomenal

1878
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:55,039
for

1879
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:55,039
both 100% nice um

1880
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:59,879
and as far as like doing concentrates go

1881
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,360
I like doing concentrates but another

1882
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,119
aspect that a lot of people need to

1883
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:06,279
think about too is that you cut your

1884
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:08,559
your labor down to nothing by doing

1885
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:11,000
concentrates like doing fresh frozen

1886
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,320
you're cutting out Harve you're

1887
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,079
harvesting and it takes a little bit

1888
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:15,519
longer you're cutting out drying you're

1889
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:16,920
cutting out curing you're cutting out

1890
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,360
bucking down you're cutting out big

1891
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,440
leafing you're cutting out trimming

1892
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:22,679
you're cutting out you're cutting off

1893
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:24,719
you know like three four months worth of

1894
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:26,199
work by doing that which you do get a

1895
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,640
very excellent product depending on who

1896
01:10:26,198 --> 01:10:29,158
you find to work with and if someone's

1897
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,600
willing to work with you which I've been

1898
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:32,279
lucky enough to find somebody that's you

1899
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:36,120
know pretty proficient at what they do

1900
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:38,119
and very regarded but

1901
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:40,119
um

1902
01:10:38,119 --> 01:10:42,158
yeah that's another aspect to think

1903
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:44,719
about is doing fresh Frozen cuts your

1904
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:46,719
labor down cuz growing outdoor is a very

1905
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:50,198
labor intensive job every step of it

1906
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:52,359
every step of the way yep and another

1907
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:55,319
cool thing about fresh frozen is um like

1908
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:57,000
even we touched on before about the

1909
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:59,319
somehow how some people will wash their

1910
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,319
buds from outdoor or even indoor if they

1911
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:02,880
so feel like it but um you know I've

1912
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:04,880
heard a majority of people will do it

1913
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,480
for health reasons because they just

1914
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,679
can't have those uh extra things that

1915
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:12,479
come and take a ride in on that outdoor

1916
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:15,119
Bud um but if you're doing fresh frozen

1917
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:17,198
and you're washing it uh for the for the

1918
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:21,559
Tricom heads you do remove a lot of

1919
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:23,759
those other potential um dusts and bugs

1920
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,560
and other things that's why when you do

1921
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,840
outdoor fresh Frozen doing rosin the

1922
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:32,000
first wash you're never going to have so

1923
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:34,239
any reputable rosin producer is never

1924
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,760
going to have a first wash cuz the first

1925
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:37,678
wash is considered

1926
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,600
contaminated so the first wash is going

1927
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:41,158
to be taken set asign for Edibles and

1928
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,280
that's like so you're going want so if

1929
01:11:41,158 --> 01:11:44,679
you're going to do a wash you're going

1930
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:47,158
to do you know the guy that taught me

1931
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:48,719
does five washes so the first wash is

1932
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:50,519
going to be a very quick wash it's going

1933
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:52,439
to be your best triome heads and it's

1934
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,840
also going to be all your contaminants

1935
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:55,519
so it's kind of a double-edged sword

1936
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,319
because you're washing off all the

1937
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:00,040
briest you know easiest to break off

1938
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:01,519
Trikes and you're taking all your

1939
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:03,960
contamination and you're setting it the

1940
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:07,400
side for Edibles are they are they not

1941
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,880
uh rinsing it oh they do R they you do

1942
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:10,399
their first wash and you rinse it and

1943
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,319
you collect all that and you set it the

1944
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,879
side it's considered contaminated now I

1945
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:15,359
don't know if they've studied this or

1946
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,239
whatever I don't know they don't How

1947
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,479
Deep The the research into this goes I'm

1948
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:20,959
sure it's there but that you're doing

1949
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:22,519
your washing your first wash or the

1950
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,279
first harvest you get out of whatever

1951
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,000
your material washing is set to the side

1952
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:28,119
for Edibles because you're then you're

1953
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,319
taking all your contaminants or anything

1954
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:31,158
that could be in there and pushing it

1955
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:32,559
out and you're not you're not pressing

1956
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:34,039
that or freeze drying it or turning into

1957
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,199
a smokeable product so you are getting a

1958
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:37,639
cleaner product from that even though

1959
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:41,319
you are taking the best of the best

1960
01:12:37,639 --> 01:12:42,520
triome heads and setting them aside sure

1961
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:45,639
that's really fascinating I've never

1962
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:47,360
heard that before but I could see how um

1963
01:12:45,639 --> 01:12:49,920
depending on the washing practices that

1964
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:52,359
might be necessary to really make sort

1965
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,480
of you know maybe this is like one of

1966
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:57,119
those tricks that people use to get that

1967
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:58,439
that what five star hash six star hash

1968
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,639
or whatever the stuff that you can just

1969
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:03,638
straight take the the you know the nice

1970
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:06,199
no contaminant when it's done just yep

1971
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:09,239
and and you can it's dabbable basically

1972
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:10,678
at that point um that's really

1973
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:12,959
fascinating I hadn't I hadn't really

1974
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:15,719
thought about that yeah and that's a way

1975
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,158
that so like when you're yeah it cleans

1976
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:19,279
it up a little bit so that is the also

1977
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:20,719
the benefit the benefit from doing you

1978
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:23,158
know if you're going to Fresh Frozen not

1979
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,760
for resin but for rosin you are going to

1980
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:26,279
get a cleaner end product that you can

1981
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,239
have too too so if you are concerned

1982
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:30,399
about contaminants from outdoor health

1983
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,799
issues or you're sensitive or whatever

1984
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:34,599
going on with that that's going to be a

1985
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,639
better product choice for sure makes a

1986
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,360
lot smoke bud but the older I get I

1987
01:13:36,639 --> 01:13:39,760
realize why people stop smoking bud it's

1988
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:41,759
not you know it is a you're still

1989
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,280
smoking and combusting something for

1990
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,280
sure I I I had to like just completely

1991
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:48,639
stop actually smoking smoking like

1992
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:51,198
combusting and I only do like a volcano

1993
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:54,279
vaporizer now or one of their

1994
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,759
um like handheld units because it just

1995
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:58,559
uh

1996
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:02,320
there's no way to kind of avoid what

1997
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,719
comes with combustion um it's yeah you

1998
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:05,599
know you're not spoking cigarettes but

1999
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:07,760
that you know over however long you've

2000
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,039
been smoking does factor into that at a

2001
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,119
certain point yeah well I spent a decade

2002
01:14:10,039 --> 01:14:15,719
smoking cigarettes too and that didn't

2003
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:17,559
help me um so you know now I get to face

2004
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:20,158
those

2005
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:22,679
consequences I'm in the same boat are

2006
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:25,839
yeah I mean that and then also growing

2007
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:30,079
up in the Bay Area I think uh blunts

2008
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,840
were life at one point and uh yeah I I I

2009
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:33,399
face those consequences now with a

2010
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,560
little bit of a cough every once in a

2011
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:37,960
while 100 100% you know you when you're

2012
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,520
younger you're like [ __ ] it then you get

2013
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,719
older and you're like H you know what

2014
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:45,480
maybe I need to rethink this a little

2015
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:49,439
bit absolutely

2016
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:53,799
um all right so uh you know since you

2017
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:55,519
spent some time doing the cultivation

2018
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,920
thing um

2019
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,639
at a professional level where you were

2020
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,679
helping out at these different Farms

2021
01:14:59,639 --> 01:15:03,719
where you were uh learning these

2022
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,679
different practices and ins and out and

2023
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:08,480
and got a paycheck basically from it

2024
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,480
without having to be the the entire

2025
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:13,759
business owner yourself and then moving

2026
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:16,158
into having your own hom grow where you

2027
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,480
were making it for your own medicine and

2028
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:22,638
for your own consumption and uh for

2029
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:24,319
sharing that flower with other people um

2030
01:15:22,639 --> 01:15:27,520
where would you like to see the

2031
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:29,880
cultivation space sort of go over the

2032
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,960
next 5 to 10 years and and where do you

2033
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,239
think as though it could

2034
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,679
improve where does it need it needs to

2035
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:39,000
be

2036
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:40,719
more less consuming energy and I know

2037
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,880
saying that to an indor grower is a bad

2038
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:45,239
thing but there is a mass amount of

2039
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:48,239
energy consumed to grow Bud for people

2040
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:50,718
to smoke it is when there's ways that

2041
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:53,839
can be done without that and I

2042
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:56,119
think how the market has been trained as

2043
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,440
far as since legalization came about and

2044
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:59,079
people that you know would never think

2045
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:00,638
about smoking weed or putting thought in

2046
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:01,760
are now smoking and they the only thing

2047
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,560
they learned of what they've been taught

2048
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,079
at the

2049
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,239
dispensary which is you know indoor

2050
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:10,639
wheed is good outdoor weed is shitty um

2051
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:12,198
and you know that's like that's as far

2052
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:14,159
as the extent goes and I'm not saying

2053
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:15,638
indoor weed well most stuff of the

2054
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:19,679
dispensary let's not lie is not very

2055
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:23,159
good but you know there are good there

2056
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:26,079
is a way to grow weed without being so

2057
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:27,359
you know Carbon heavy us it carbon have

2058
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:28,439
been growing it I think there needs to

2059
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:29,960
be a shift to that because if you look

2060
01:16:28,439 --> 01:16:32,279
at how many warehouses have been built

2061
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:34,239
to grow weed or how many warehouses have

2062
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:36,319
been repurposed and there's thousands of

2063
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:39,000
Lights in there just you know run the

2064
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:41,399
meter is kind of like working away from

2065
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,119
that and the thing about outdoor that

2066
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:46,238
gets a bad wrap is if you're going to

2067
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:48,559
try to grow 300 plants with five people

2068
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:50,039
you're not going to grow good wheat like

2069
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,760
it needs to be brought down to a smaller

2070
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:53,279
scale which I don't ever see happening I

2071
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,480
would like to see that but I don't think

2072
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:55,359
that it's going to be there but if you

2073
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:58,198
can grow

2074
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:59,479
outdoor at and you can figure out how

2075
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:02,000
much you can do to grow like that's

2076
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:04,000
where I'm at I have 15 plants probably

2077
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,560
can't grow more than 15 plants and still

2078
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,238
do what I do because I'm going to

2079
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,400
overburden myself with labor yeah you

2080
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:11,319
know and that's just personal

2081
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:13,519
perspective but to see the market go to

2082
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:16,639
more of a niche smaller farmer kind of

2083
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,480
thing and making it more accessible to

2084
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:20,319
smaller Growers to get into the market

2085
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:22,198
rather than just saying you know if you

2086
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:23,960
don't have $2 million in backing you're

2087
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:25,559
never going to be a business is kind of

2088
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,039
where it's at now I

2089
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,080
maybe not so much in Oregon but as far

2090
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:31,719
as Colorado and California go like

2091
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:33,039
you're not getting into the market it's

2092
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:37,158
it's kind of the same in Oregon right

2093
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:39,479
now and um with the the price per pound

2094
01:17:37,158 --> 01:17:41,439
going down significantly over the past

2095
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:43,759
three years and and continuing to go

2096
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:46,519
down uh while the cost of production

2097
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,239
continues to go up it does seem as

2098
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:52,880
though any point that you can reduce

2099
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:55,079
your costs uh or increase the not only

2100
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,760
the quality but the quantity of

2101
01:17:55,079 --> 01:18:00,079
production unfortunately is extremely

2102
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:03,400
important to make sure that small

2103
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:05,679
businesses continue to remain viable um

2104
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:08,519
a lot of these larger businesses because

2105
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:12,760
overhead uh costs go down as you scale

2106
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:15,560
up um when it comes to

2107
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:17,520
um like how much it costs to run a

2108
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:20,719
business versus how much income that

2109
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,320
business makes your net your your cost

2110
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,439
to grow a pound goes down when you grow

2111
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:26,599
more obviously but what yeah what goes

2112
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:28,279
in entails that does the quality go down

2113
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,639
nothing no other factors is measured

2114
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:34,719
other than what can I produce for it's

2115
01:18:31,639 --> 01:18:37,480
all the bottom line yes and that that is

2116
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:40,480
unfortunate and um you know I I

2117
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:43,359
mentioned RJ Reynolds earlier uh and and

2118
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:45,519
other large uh either tobacco companies

2119
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:47,599
or other uh multic conglomerate

2120
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,520
companies that may pivot into the

2121
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,199
Cannabis space if it were to become

2122
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:55,880
federally legal uh are going to be able

2123
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:58,439
to produce uh cannabis

2124
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:00,359
uh I you know fortunately and

2125
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:03,839
unfortunately we've been able to

2126
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:06,198
increase how well cannabis can be grown

2127
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,480
with less of

2128
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:13,158
a uh like

2129
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:15,559
secretive nature to the processes behind

2130
01:19:13,158 --> 01:19:19,079
it a lot of this information is now more

2131
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:20,360
readily available and companies with

2132
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:24,399
lots

2133
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:27,479
of uh Expendable Revenue that they can

2134
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:31,238
put in into re research and development

2135
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:33,759
and creating methodologies that produce

2136
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:35,678
cannabis at a specific level especially

2137
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,400
if they're homogenizing an end product

2138
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:39,079
like a pre-roll or something like that

2139
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:41,000
or a

2140
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:43,359
concentrate companies that have the

2141
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,359
ability to produce vast amounts of

2142
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:48,319
cannabis and get it to the market for a

2143
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:51,719
very low price but maintain

2144
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:54,039
consistency and a certain level of

2145
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:56,719
quality not necessarily you know top

2146
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:58,519
shelf height quality you know that guy

2147
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:00,840
with four lights in his garage that's

2148
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:03,960
growing everything in a living soil bed

2149
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:05,760
and just crushing it um you know like

2150
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,359
not that level of quality but something

2151
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,400
where it's it's smokable it's not going

2152
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:11,880
to get you sick because it it has a

2153
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:14,599
specific level of standard that it has

2154
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:16,159
to be held to because you have all these

2155
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,320
different regulations you're going to

2156
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:21,279
have something that's going to be

2157
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:23,079
usable but it's going to be hores light

2158
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:25,119
it's going to be yeah you're I was going

2159
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:27,198
to say you're talking Miller Light yeah

2160
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:29,039
it's going to be something that is a

2161
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:31,279
lower quality product but it's going to

2162
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:33,119
be consistent and it's going to Garner

2163
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:36,158
the most use out of your average

2164
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:38,039
consumer because for me like I used to

2165
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:40,279
be a chef but I still love getting a

2166
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:42,000
burger from like In-N-Out or McDonald's

2167
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:44,399
or something where it's

2168
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,800
consistent you know I know exactly what

2169
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:48,319
it's going to be you know going to a

2170
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,840
Burger House or something where there

2171
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:52,158
it's a fancy restaurant that has a

2172
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,920
really nice burger sometimes I'm like

2173
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:56,238
did they did they do too much did they

2174
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,880
not do enough am I going to be

2175
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:01,158
overpaying and way under under liking

2176
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:05,480
what it is oh

2177
01:21:01,158 --> 01:21:07,158
100% um yeah that's like that's when it

2178
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:09,079
when it when the top comes off and it

2179
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:11,599
fully goes legal there's going to be

2180
01:21:09,079 --> 01:21:13,000
it's going to be a race to mediocrity to

2181
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,960
say not to be negative about it but it's

2182
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,399
going to be a race to the middle not to

2183
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,480
the bottom or the top because it has to

2184
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:21,599
like meet some standards for enough

2185
01:21:19,479 --> 01:21:22,759
people to be repeat customers cuz that's

2186
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,079
the only way that they're going to be

2187
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:28,239
able to maintain any sort of business

2188
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:29,679
model like that but it can't be the best

2189
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:31,079
because that's going to cost too much to

2190
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,679
produce and it can't be the worst

2191
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:33,840
because well no one's going to want to

2192
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:35,520
come back to it so it has to be

2193
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,119
somewhere in the middle and you know

2194
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,600
there's a lot of advanc advancements in

2195
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:43,800
technology within the Cannabis space

2196
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:45,679
like the distillation of different tpin

2197
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,960
and the mixing of different tarpine

2198
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:51,560
profiles to match specific cannabis

2199
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:53,480
cultivars and doing that through either

2200
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:57,039
gathered tpin from Cannabis production

2201
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:58,919
or synthetically tpin or uh you know

2202
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:02,198
exogenously sourced tpin from

2203
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:04,119
non-cannabis related still like natural

2204
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:05,839
sources but then the mixing of those and

2205
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:10,840
the application of that

2206
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:14,159
to you know R roll flour or even whole

2207
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:16,639
pounds of what looks like nice cannabis

2208
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:19,279
but may be completely tpless when it's

2209
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:21,719
done drying and curing because they

2210
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:23,800
dried it and cured it in 5 days you know

2211
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:26,480
yeah or whatever race to the end goal

2212
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,800
was yeah that that yeah well like what

2213
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:29,879
I've noticed here in California I'm sure

2214
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:32,679
it's the same everywhere is so when I

2215
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,159
came out here it was full boom like

2216
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:36,880
Farmers everywhere like nobody liked I

2217
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:38,399
want say nobody liked Farmers there were

2218
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,119
so there were farmers everywhere and

2219
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:42,000
they got a bad rap from coming in from

2220
01:22:40,119 --> 01:22:44,279
out of you know different states coming

2221
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,119
and setting up shop trashing everything

2222
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:48,800
and leaving and being able to survive as

2223
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:52,119
a business while creating a product that

2224
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:54,600
was horrible just because of the lack of

2225
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:56,760
demand and the kind of approach I took

2226
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,480
as like leaving leaving the industry so

2227
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:01,039
to say and finding a different career

2228
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:02,959
and then still doing what I'm doing is

2229
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:05,158
like you're watching all these Legacy

2230
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,439
farmers fall off left and right and

2231
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:09,679
obviously by quality first like the

2232
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:11,919
lower quality farmers are Dro it off the

2233
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,639
mid quality farmers are dropping off

2234
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:17,440
even people that grew pretty decent

2235
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:18,800
flower either change their practices

2236
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:20,238
based on how much money they could get

2237
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,119
out of it right so if you're not getting

2238
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:25,279
3,000 a pound anymore you're getting you

2239
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:27,279
know 250 to 500 a pound

2240
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:28,880
well all the practices they use to grow

2241
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:30,119
good weed they are not doing anymore

2242
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,079
because they're try they're trying to

2243
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:35,639
survive so all of your high-end flower

2244
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:37,519
on the outdoor scene is starting to fall

2245
01:23:35,639 --> 01:23:39,199
off too and you're starting to lose any

2246
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,639
good outdoor flower that you can find I

2247
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:44,559
mean it's hard to find good outdoor weed

2248
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:46,319
Y which only furthers furthers the whole

2249
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,960
thing that outdoor is not good which is

2250
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,799
like it's stigmatizing almost it's like

2251
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,520
starting the self- ending cycle of like

2252
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:56,119
it's just going to try to burn itself

2253
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:58,440
out yeah yeah it's like the the snake

2254
01:23:56,119 --> 01:24:01,039
that eats its tail the the Ora Boris

2255
01:23:58,439 --> 01:24:03,359
it's just uh going around and continuing

2256
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:06,238
to eat itself and it's never going to

2257
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:08,479
stop um yeah I agree with that it is

2258
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:12,000
unfortunate to see sort of some of these

2259
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:12,000
trends that it it

2260
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,840
almost it's going to be hard to break

2261
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:18,560
the cycles and these trends that they've

2262
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:21,719
already started

2263
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:23,719
because as the price per pound goes down

2264
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:26,960
yeah you can pivot away from more

2265
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:30,119
expensive puts uh uh less intensive

2266
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:32,039
farming practices um but if it was those

2267
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:34,920
intensive farming practices or the

2268
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:37,359
specific inputs or uh different things

2269
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:39,319
that you did to make your farm work

2270
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:40,639
because as you know these are plants and

2271
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:42,399
they're growing and they're alive and

2272
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,279
they need things to make sure that they

2273
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:46,198
stay alive and if you start to remove

2274
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:49,158
those different

2275
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:51,960
things maybe your plants don't survive a

2276
01:24:49,158 --> 01:24:54,759
year maybe you have a failed half crop

2277
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:57,359
or something like that and maybe that

2278
01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:00,920
crop was what was needed to keep the

2279
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:07,679
lights on or you know oh 100%

2280
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:10,039
so you so because yeah it feels like the

2281
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:12,719
way that things are moving away from

2282
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:15,399
smaller Growers being able to provide

2283
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:18,639
for their local community to larger

2284
01:25:15,399 --> 01:25:21,719
scale Growers providing for a more macro

2285
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:26,000
Community um within each

2286
01:25:21,719 --> 01:25:29,439
state and and how homeg growing seems to

2287
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:32,639
be sort of one of the last bastions of

2288
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:34,678
ability for people to produce the

2289
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,880
medicine that they want or the Cannabis

2290
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:39,960
that they want not necessarily what's

2291
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,600
available on the market um what would be

2292
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,880
some advice that you would give to new

2293
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:47,719
Growers based

2294
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:50,000
on your successes and failures as a

2295
01:25:47,719 --> 01:25:52,319
grower

2296
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,319
yourself advice I would give to new

2297
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:57,799
Growers is

2298
01:25:55,319 --> 01:26:00,000
don't stop doing what you're doing it's

2299
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:03,199
very very easy to get discouraged to

2300
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,520
have a bad year and especially like if

2301
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:05,919
you care about what you do and it's a

2302
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,880
passion project and you're doing this

2303
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,719
because you believe in it it's really

2304
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,600
easy to get disheartened having a bad

2305
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:13,158
year like you can have a bad year and

2306
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,159
your bad year can be six like if you're

2307
01:26:13,158 --> 01:26:16,559
outdoor it could be six months long that

2308
01:26:15,158 --> 01:26:18,000
you are just like and you don't want to

2309
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,440
do it next

2310
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,960
year you know so like what if you choose

2311
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:23,198
to do if you choose to start growing

2312
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,960
outdoor and you want to grow what you

2313
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,719
want to grow for you

2314
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,359
and then you need to kind of take pride

2315
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,679
in that and like there are you're going

2316
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:31,158
to take some hits to the face you're

2317
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,600
going to get knocked down and it's like

2318
01:26:31,158 --> 01:26:33,519
I mean you're going to get you're not

2319
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,079
going to know what you're doing you're

2320
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,280
going to get blindsided by pests you're

2321
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:37,639
going to not know you're going to kill a

2322
01:26:36,279 --> 01:26:39,279
plant you're going to you know all these

2323
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:40,800
things are going to happen and it's not

2324
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:42,960
something that you need to stop doing it

2325
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,119
because of that like you need to like

2326
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,039
try to remove the emotion from it and

2327
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:48,000
like logically look at what you're doing

2328
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:49,079
because when you put a bunch of time and

2329
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,319
effort into something especially like an

2330
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:54,279
outdoor even what I do is considered

2331
01:26:51,319 --> 01:26:56,359
small you know on the scale of Outdoors

2332
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:59,158
like it's easy to like I mean you got to

2333
01:26:56,359 --> 01:27:01,920
just keep rolling with it yep it seems

2334
01:26:59,158 --> 01:27:05,759
like uh something that it seems like to

2335
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:07,399
be a repeat uh advice for new Growers is

2336
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,960
don't let your

2337
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:12,479
failures remain failures let them become

2338
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:13,800
a Learning lesson so that you can take

2339
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:16,559
that

2340
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,520
information that you gain within that

2341
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,639
failure so that you don't then face

2342
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:23,600
those same failures again in the future

2343
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:25,520
100% And it's like when you first start

2344
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,320
growing it's like falling up the

2345
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,639
stairs like you're going to you're going

2346
01:27:27,319 --> 01:27:31,759
to hit the you're going to just keep

2347
01:27:29,639 --> 01:27:33,480
[ __ ] up until you end up to a spot

2348
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,440
where you have something that you like

2349
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:37,279
kind of understand what you're doing and

2350
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:39,638
like like like we saw touched on before

2351
01:27:37,279 --> 01:27:42,880
you get one shot a year don't let the

2352
01:27:39,639 --> 01:27:44,239
first year that you just completely [ __ ]

2353
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,560
the whole thing up stop you from trying

2354
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:50,000
to get the next year for sure it's just

2355
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:53,280
like any other skill or practice um

2356
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:56,039
there's plenty of different books or um

2357
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:57,039
ID IDE IES that will say you know you

2358
01:27:56,039 --> 01:28:00,000
need

2359
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:02,319
10,000 hours of practice to become a

2360
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,880
master at something or you know a

2361
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:07,799
million hours of practice to to become

2362
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,679
you proficient at something I I don't

2363
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:14,039
forget the exact or I forget the exact

2364
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:15,520
numbers but repetition and perseverance

2365
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:17,800
through a lot of these different

2366
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,520
practices and aspects of cultivation are

2367
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:22,920
what go are what are going to make you a

2368
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:24,880
better cultivator overall and every time

2369
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:28,239
you fail if you pick yourself up dust

2370
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:30,319
yourself off and say that suck I don't

2371
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:33,000
want that to happen again how am I going

2372
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:35,039
to prevent that like I failed and this

2373
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,920
is what I did wrong don't don't try to

2374
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:38,840
blame or figure out some reason why it

2375
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,319
wasn't what you did which I mean that's

2376
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,760
like that's generally in life too if you

2377
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:43,679
can accept the responsibility you can

2378
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,679
move on another thing I would offer to

2379
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:48,679
new Growers is don't be afraid to ask

2380
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:50,118
questions because I don't know one of

2381
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:51,440
the Jungle boys browers said that you

2382
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:53,319
can give people the tech and they won't

2383
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:55,519
use it anyway like there's like some

2384
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:57,279
sort of ego about growing and I don't

2385
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,679
understand like how it works that no one

2386
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:01,039
wants to listen to the other person and

2387
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:01,920
I'm sure you've experienced this like

2388
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:03,639
you could be like I know what you're

2389
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,118
doing wrong change this okay well if

2390
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:06,279
you're not because I said that you're

2391
01:29:05,118 --> 01:29:08,399
not going to do it now or whatever it

2392
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:11,039
may be like don't be afraid to ask for

2393
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:13,279
advice and find somebody that does grow

2394
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:14,920
and pick their brain because especially

2395
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:17,198
with outdoor if someone like I've been

2396
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:18,920
growing about a decade if you if it's

2397
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:20,198
your first outdoor and you have access

2398
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:22,679
to somebody who's been doing it for 10

2399
01:29:20,198 --> 01:29:24,839
years like that's going to be your key

2400
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:25,840
to getting better quicker yeah like

2401
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,039
you're not going to get the actual

2402
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:29,760
experience doing it but like you're

2403
01:29:28,039 --> 01:29:32,238
going to like you're going to learn

2404
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,840
don't do ab c and d and then that's

2405
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:35,039
going to keep you from fail you know

2406
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,239
that's going to bring in like your

2407
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:38,560
success to be like I know I'm not going

2408
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:40,079
to fail this way and I know I'm not

2409
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,239
going to screw it up this way like

2410
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,600
listen to people around you that have

2411
01:29:41,238 --> 01:29:45,118
done it like don't be too egocentric

2412
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,000
that you can't take advice from somebody

2413
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:48,519
because if you get one shot a year it's

2414
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,800
going to take a long time to get good

2415
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:52,080
and you might as well talk to somebody

2416
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:54,480
who's done it and get some like take

2417
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:56,158
their input y I was just going to say

2418
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:58,919
don't let pride and ego stand in your

2419
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:01,839
way it's this is a it's it's hard to

2420
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:03,679
grow really good cannabis um and not

2421
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,440
necessarily because like the processes

2422
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:07,800
are hard but because there's so many

2423
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:09,759
different aspects to it that can fail

2424
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,159
and without knowing what those things

2425
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:14,719
are ahead of time or how to react to

2426
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:17,359
them you can have this sort of Snowball

2427
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:19,639
Effect and cause an avalanche to fall

2428
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:21,559
down on the grow around you without

2429
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:24,159
setting up those proper barriers to

2430
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:25,560
prevent it well that too and like then

2431
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:28,158
you talk about the whole atmosphere

2432
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:30,960
online like from Instagram it's like but

2433
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:34,638
it's so egocentric to grow weed like and

2434
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:36,639
I don't like on a mass scale it's like a

2435
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:39,480
personal pride and like everybody's ego

2436
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:41,679
is literally tied to them growing weed

2437
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:43,678
that like even new Growers like even if

2438
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,480
you were to stumble upon Instagram like

2439
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:47,719
this is the vibe that the whole industry

2440
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:50,638
gives off and it's like this [ __ ] you

2441
01:30:47,719 --> 01:30:52,118
I'm the best kind of vibe which I mean

2442
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,639
when you get people with long experience

2443
01:30:52,118 --> 01:30:55,799
you people are showing off and there is

2444
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:58,600
a there is ego in there and there is you

2445
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:59,920
know pride in people's work but like

2446
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,760
from an outside perspective if you were

2447
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,679
just trying to get into it like looking

2448
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:07,039
at all like the way that people think

2449
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:09,039
and act about cannabis online is not

2450
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:10,279
going to help you in reality like it's

2451
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:12,079
all it's going to do is hold you back

2452
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:14,479
and it's kind of gatekeeping in like a

2453
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:16,600
like a brainwash way that everybody want

2454
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:18,959
to acts like they're so good and you're

2455
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,520
never going to get to their level which

2456
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,800
is not true at all like I mean there's

2457
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,600
plenty of people that are open to

2458
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,719
discussing and giving advice but like

2459
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,320
when you look at the Grand Vibe of

2460
01:31:25,719 --> 01:31:28,600
everything online it's telling you the

2461
01:31:27,319 --> 01:31:30,920
opposite and don't you don't need to

2462
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:32,679
believe that nope yeah it's it's the

2463
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:37,279
exact that is the exact opposite of

2464
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:38,880
what's the truth to Growing um there are

2465
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:41,519
more people that are going to be willing

2466
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:44,639
to teach you how to grow and help you

2467
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:48,159
along the way um especially when it

2468
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:51,118
comes to trying to help fix something or

2469
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:54,118
trying to help prevent something or

2470
01:31:51,118 --> 01:31:55,439
react to something or set up the best

2471
01:31:54,118 --> 01:31:57,479
practices ahead of time so that you

2472
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:58,919
don't run into those issues there's so

2473
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:01,599
many people that want to help new

2474
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:03,520
Growers because without new Growers

2475
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,360
getting into this it's it could

2476
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,360
eventually become something stagnant

2477
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:10,079
that does go to only the people who can

2478
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:12,158
afford it and that's when we do start to

2479
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:15,238
run into issues like we were talking

2480
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:18,319
about earlier of larger companies being

2481
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:21,879
the only source for cannabis and if

2482
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:24,079
that's what can happen we want to try

2483
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:25,480
and prevent that and by trying to

2484
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:28,719
prevent that I think one of the best

2485
01:32:25,479 --> 01:32:32,359
ways that we can is by promoting hom

2486
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:34,920
Growers to continue to grow um and to do

2487
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:38,158
it as best as they possibly can

2488
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:40,639
because it's you know it's just as easy

2489
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:43,079
to produce enough for yourself as it is

2490
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:45,719
to produce enough for yourself and a few

2491
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:47,519
other people and other people see that

2492
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:49,198
you can produce it for them maybe they

2493
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,000
want to get into it and it can just

2494
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:52,279
spread and spread and spread and

2495
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,639
hopefully you know eventually you know

2496
01:32:52,279 --> 01:32:55,639
I've heard other people say we want to

2497
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:57,560
over overgrow the nation where there's

2498
01:32:55,639 --> 01:33:00,319
just more Growers than people know what

2499
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:02,080
to do with and so larger corporations

2500
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:06,719
don't have an opportunity to enter the

2501
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:09,399
market because there's just no demand um

2502
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:10,639
something like that would be off 100%

2503
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:12,638
And that's

2504
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:13,960
like kind of like I don't want to sound

2505
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:15,960
egocentric like I can go down to

2506
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,000
dispensary and buy the most expensive

2507
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:20,079
weed there and the stuff that I grow

2508
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,920
like blows it out of the water like and

2509
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:24,439
that's like where what you don't realize

2510
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:26,920
is like or what people don't realize

2511
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:28,559
this the like whoever's advertising you

2512
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:30,920
that they have the best weed at the

2513
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,159
dispensary or wherever is full of [ __ ]

2514
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:34,239
in its marketing 90% of the time I don't

2515
01:33:33,158 --> 01:33:35,599
want to say it always is like you're

2516
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:37,000
going to find stuff that's really good

2517
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,840
there but you're not going to find it

2518
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,158
being advertised very heavily and

2519
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:42,800
there's not going to be a lot of it it's

2520
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:44,719
going to be very Niche definitely you

2521
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:47,880
know it's not hard to get I mean I want

2522
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:51,439
say it's not hard it's not impossible to

2523
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:54,239
out compete a lot of the commercial

2524
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:56,198
Growers just from the reason like

2525
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:58,198
yes terms of quality it's not hard to

2526
01:33:56,198 --> 01:33:59,678
out compete like from a home grower

2527
01:33:58,198 --> 01:34:02,799
aspect and that's what people need to

2528
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:04,158
realize too is that like people talk a

2529
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,800
big game about a lot of the weed

2530
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:08,079
especially in like the that commercial

2531
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:11,520
sense and like the legal industry but

2532
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:13,158
it's all hype 100 like not all of it but

2533
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,320
it's there's a lot of fluff in there and

2534
01:34:13,158 --> 01:34:15,439
there's a lot of people that don't know

2535
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:16,880
what they're doing and a lot of people

2536
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:19,000
that have grew two years and now have a

2537
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,440
job growing and like there's a lot of

2538
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,158
there's a lot of a lack of Legacy in

2539
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:25,960
that market that like is not it's not

2540
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,879
hard to get up to where they're

2541
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:31,039
at it's not it a lot of it like I said

2542
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,960
earlier there's so much accessible

2543
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:37,000
information online or through

2544
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:40,198
communities or forums or uh chat groups

especially as it pertains to outdoor

2557
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:09,400
practices and maintaining a specific

2558

level of quality and um high

2599
01:36:49,319 --> 01:36:54,118
little question here what is your most

2600
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:56,439
memorable cannabis related

2601
01:36:54,118 --> 01:36:59,079
experience most memorable in a good or a

2602
01:36:56,439 --> 01:37:01,079
bad way I kind I kind of want to tell my

2603
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:03,399
RAID story just so people that uh

2604
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:05,719
haven't weren't around when this was a

2605
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:07,679
thing understand this that sounds like

2606
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:10,118
it could be a memorable story it was

2607
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,679
very memorable so I worked at this this

2608
01:37:10,118 --> 01:37:12,759
the first job I had where I was running

2609
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:15,760
the farm and it was the one I told you

2610
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:18,039
about Lake County so it was on the side

2611
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,239
of a mountain and it was off botle Rock

2612
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:20,639
Road if you want to look it up in Lake

2613
01:37:19,238 --> 01:37:22,799
County I think it's Kelseyville

2614
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:24,159
California so it's in the middle of it's

2615
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,039
kind of in the middle of nowhere on the

2616
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:28,920
side of this mountain and you had to

2617
01:37:26,039 --> 01:37:30,118
drive this really long you know windy

2618
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:32,760
[ __ ] Gravel Road that you could

2619
01:37:30,118 --> 01:37:34,319
barely get a car up to get there and I

2620
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:37,880
think it was mid

2621
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:39,759
August late August and I like where I

2622
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:41,039
stayed was in The Shack on the side this

2623
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,639
sounds really stupid but there was a

2624
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:44,719
Shack on the mountain on stilts and so

2625
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:47,118
there was a like a a shed basically on

2626
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,439
top of these stilts and I remember

2627
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:49,719
sitting there one day and it was

2628
01:37:48,439 --> 01:37:50,919
probably noon it was like in the middle

2629
01:37:49,719 --> 01:37:52,439
of the day when it was hot so I was

2630
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,679
inside and I heard a car I'm like I

2631
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:55,559
don't recognize this car I don't

2632
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:57,199
recognize the sound of this car and so I

2633
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,639
open the door up to the shack and I look

2634
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:00,960
out and I have a bunch of guys pointing

2635
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:02,880
AR-15s at me and so the sheriff had

2636
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:05,679
walked up in front of the truck that was

2637
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:07,279
driving so they were already at the door

2638
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,639
so you get the full raid experience

2639
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:10,519
they're screaming at you pointing guns

2640
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:12,440
at you telling you to get on the ground

2641
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:13,639
like I get out of there and at the time

2642
01:38:12,439 --> 01:38:15,839
I was on the side of mountain so I

2643
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:18,679
didn't wear shoes the whole time Tippy

2644
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:20,239
[ __ ] so I get out of the I go out of the

2645
01:38:18,679 --> 01:38:22,000
shack they're screaming at me to get on

2646
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:23,198
the ground freeze they're asking me

2647
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,359
where my shoes are at I don't have any

2648
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:27,000
shoes sh and they get up and you know

2649
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:28,519
they're the tough guys you know so they

2650
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,439
arrest me and I'm sitting there and I'm

2651
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,679
shaking while they're putting me in

2652
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:32,279
handcuffs and the guy looks at me he's

2653
01:38:30,679 --> 01:38:33,359
like why are why are you so nervous H

2654
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:35,920
what are you nervous about and I was

2655
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:37,598
like I've never been arrested before and

2656
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,158
you see the look in these guys' face

2657
01:38:37,599 --> 01:38:43,840
just go from like they're you know

2658
01:38:39,158 --> 01:38:47,000
they've got the bad guy too like oh okay

2659
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,360
and so they they handcuffed me they put

2660
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,800
me up and they set me off to the side

2661
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:52,079
and they sit there with the they take

2662
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,039
the side by side and everything that's

2663
01:38:52,079 --> 01:38:55,760
on the property and it takes them 6

2664
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:57,439
hours to cut all these plants down cuz

2665
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,400
they're cage so they had me sitting

2666
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:02,479
there watching them cut all these plants

2667
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:04,118
down the that I spent all your growing

2668
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:05,559
and dragging them in front of me and

2669
01:39:04,118 --> 01:39:07,319
putting on this whole you know

2670
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:09,760
production that you know they like

2671
01:39:07,319 --> 01:39:11,279
you're you know like you know shame on

2672
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:15,159
you look at all what we're

2673
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:16,519
doing um it wasn't it wasn't very fun no

2674
01:39:15,158 --> 01:39:17,960
that's probably the most memorable one

2675
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:20,280
that was the one that impacted me the

2676
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,679
most I want say in a positive way but

2677
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:24,198
kind of seeing how you always hear about

2678
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:26,000
people getting raped and you hear about

2679
01:39:24,198 --> 01:39:27,399
like the past you know like the cops and

2680
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,198
the helicopters like when you're

2681
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:32,158
involved in that that is like they they

2682
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:33,759
aren't [ __ ] around oh that sounds

2683
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:35,839
quite terrifying actually like it was a

2684
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:38,239
little little traumatizing but it it

2685
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,599
definitely made an impact on me for sure

2686
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:42,519
well I mean it seems like you made it

2687
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:46,079
out of there uh sem semi

2688
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:47,480
unscathed I did make yes 100% it was a

2689
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:49,319
whole it was a whole thing that ran on

2690
01:39:47,479 --> 01:39:51,238
for about 2 years but yeah for anybody

2691
01:39:49,319 --> 01:39:53,399
who's watching that wasn't around in the

2692
01:39:51,238 --> 01:39:56,238
in the Black Market Days like getting

2693
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:57,759
rated is definitely a scary not fun

2694
01:39:56,238 --> 01:40:01,359
experience that I'm glad we've kind of

2695
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:03,159
gotten past as a as a cannabis community

2696
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:06,598
and law enforcement how well they don't

2697
01:40:03,158 --> 01:40:09,359
interact together wow well I mean that

2698
01:40:06,599 --> 01:40:11,639
is definitely a memorable cannabis

2699
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:13,238

2700
