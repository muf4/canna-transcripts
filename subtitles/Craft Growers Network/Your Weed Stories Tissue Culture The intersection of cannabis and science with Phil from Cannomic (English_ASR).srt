2
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,559
what's up everybody welcome to your weed

3
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,679
stories on the craft Growers Network

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,759
today we are joined by Phil estan he's

5
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,839
the tissue culture expert from konomac

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,400
and the grateful Head we're excited to

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,678
learn about his story and we think we're

8
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,199
going to learn at least a little

9
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,079
something about tissue culture today so

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,000
welcome to the show Phil thank you for

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,759
having me oh and of course we've got our

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Slovenian Hobbit Sasha joining us he's

13
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,479
our European correspondent and he's also

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,519
very interested in learning about some

15
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:52,599
tissue culture so um Phil why don't we

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,000
start by you telling us a little bit

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,558
about your cannabis Story how your first

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,878
experiences in cannabis and sure how it

19
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,280
led you to tissue culture okay sure I

20
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:08,039
think my first experiences are pretty

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,200
common but just a bunch of guys were my

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,840
you know friends hanging out smoking not

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,759
knowing if I'm doing it right the first

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,799
time coping more than I expect and then

25
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:23,000
eventually it clicked I think by the

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,799
time I was in my early 20s cannabis had

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,560
found a main stay in my life and I was

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,920
fortunate enough to be studying genetics

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,159
at that time um

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,759
and there was an opportunity I'm

31
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,560
originally from the state of Connecticut

32
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,799
it had just uh expanded into medical and

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,600
there was an opportunity when I was in

34
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,960
grad school to work at a medical

35
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,319
facility and that was really the Gateway

36
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,118
that showed me that it could be a career

37
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:52,559
path and then more than just a personal

38
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:55,759
lifestyle something that can be a

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,600
community and added to and since then

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,359
I've never thought of working in any

41
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:04,199
other industry what was your role at

42
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:08,800
that cannabis um facility sure so this

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,920
was a extraction laboratory so basically

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,319
I was just like a a low Tech um they so

45
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:18,079
Connecticut very funny in the beginning

46
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,560
they did not necessarily know how to

47
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,239
legalize uh cannabis and how to legalize

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,920
these kind of auxilary things that would

49
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,560
be associated with cannabis like

50
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,878
extraction stuff like that so initially

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,400
they did not allow any organic solvents

52
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:34,919
including water essentially and that's

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
pretty tough in a facility outside of

54
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,079
the extraction lab you know not being

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,920
able to use water so they quickly

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,560
remediated that they allowed alcohol but

57
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,759
you couldn't use hydrocarbon so in

58
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,400
Connecticut at least in 2015 2016 all

59
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,679
they were using was super critical CO2

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,519
because it was solventless at that time

61
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,840
didn't know about necessarily the

62
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,879
techniques that we have nowadays and I

63
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,080
was doing that I was ramping up super

64
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,000
critical systems running them very far

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,440
away from my biology

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,039
background um but they had initially had

67
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:14,759
interest in doing tissue culture and

68
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:18,639
they asked me to figure out how to do it

69
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:22,519
essentially um which is obvious what

70
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:26,639
ended up leading me into this specific

71
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,680
Pursuit nice and where were you studying

72
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,039
was that in Connecticut yeah University

73
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,760
of Connecticut

74
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:39,959
nice and slasha you're you're muted I

75
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:43,039
believe sorry uh beside beside the the

76
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,400
ethanol and uh CO2 super critical did

77
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,039
you also use uh Bon extraction V so at

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,640
that time you could not use any

79
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,919
hydrocarbon you couldn't use anything

80
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:57,039
really yeah what about today is it legal

81
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,958
uh to use V1 today in

82
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,840
Connecticut so you know Connecticut is a

83
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,920
very interesting State it's a little bit

84
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,598
of um so for reference in 2015 2016 when

85
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,158
I was there it was only medical they

86
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,959
only had four producers since then

87
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,840
they've expanded to adult use and

88
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,560
they've expanded to four producers so

89
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,519
it's the same people that were providing

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,439
for medical have now split their product

91
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,519
between medical and adult use the rules

92
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,079
around adult use I'm not exactly

93
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,758
familiar with but I'm I am pretty

94
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,439
confident that medical is still only

95
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,439
allowed to be solved

96
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,879
so now with the lizin and and stuff like

97
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,399
that there has been an expanded

98
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,719
portfolio but you know there's no closed

99
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:43,478
loop systems or stuff like

100
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,800
that okay and

101
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:49,120
um when you were were studying you were

102
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,520
studying biology is that what you said

103
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,600
yeah so I went to school for molecular

104
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,478
biology basically genetics H and what

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,560
were you interested in studying before

106
00:04:55,478 --> 00:05:02,839
you got into Canada uh cannabis as far

107
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:05,120
as uh molecular bi sure I think um in

108
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:09,719
general genetics that always fascinated

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,038
me the the ability to kind of Meet the

110
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,400
moment when chemistry gained some

111
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:15,560
sentience even though I think there's a

112
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,679
lot of very good chemists out there

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,519
would say there's even preor uh prior uh

114
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,959
examples of that but for me that was the

115
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:26,439
first thing that clicked I had worked in

116
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,239
uh Immunology Labs before and done a lot

117
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:32,038
of bacterial work a lot of genetics work

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,960
a lot of viral work like that all very

119
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:39,079
fascinating I think uh especially when

120
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:41,758
we apply these techniques to medical

121
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,038
research and stuff like that there's a

122
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,360
lot of potential for Therapeutics that

123
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,079
traditional medical approaches couldn't

124
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,919
necessarily solve or Target so that was

125
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,240
always very fascinating to me the idea

126
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:57,560
of working for a company like Asen or

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,519
fizer was a lot less uh appetizing to me

128
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,879
so ultimately that Canabis being an

129
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,918
alternative pathway was very

130
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:09,560
tantalizing and when you were um asked

131
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:13,478
to learn about tissue culture how did

132
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,680
you how did you start that Journey sure

133
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:17,120
so I was still at uh the University of

134
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,598
Connecticut I was in the genetics

135
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,160
department finishing up my masters and

136
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:26,319
while doing this um this work at this uh

137
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,720
medical marijuana facility so when they

138
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,319
asked me I just went to the plant

139
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,240
science department

140
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,680
and asked uh Professor Name by the name

141
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,639
of Gerald

142
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,000
burtz who was doing uh tissue culture on

143
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,240
a plant called arabidopsis a model

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,680
organism for plant science but not

145
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,319
necessarily A commercially or consumer

146
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,079
common crop so I asked him and he was

147
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,560
like I have no idea how to do it but why

148
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,800
don't you just come and like study here

149
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,120
and maybe we can figure it out together

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,038
and I was like why don't I just come and

151
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,519
study here and we can figure it out

152
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,639
together and so I very promptly left the

153
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,000
uh the opportunity I had the medical

154
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,439
marijuana facility and contined to do

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,079
research uh under Gerald bur Woods's Lab

156
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,839
at the University of Connecticut and

157
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,478
there at that time only the lot of

158
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,918
Publications from Old Miss were

159
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:22,918
accessible so that was our starting

160
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:25,680
point as I believe many people starting

161
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,120
points back at that time um but we were

162
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,400
fortunate to find some things that

163
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,720
worked and when my time finished with uh

164
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:40,799
at at Yukon we start we came and started

165
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:44,319
kenic and so a question is were was it

166
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,560
allowed and I mean did that even matter

167
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,319
to experiment on cannabis at the

168
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,240
University since you did not have a

169
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,919
license through the university okay so

170
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,038
yes it was allowed because in 2016 they

171
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,158
had passed the farm bill which was the

172
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:02,120
first time that they allowed research

173
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:07,000
institutions and agricultural

174
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,918
institutions to research hemp CBD hemp

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,560
like no one was doing the

176
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,359
thca Nifty loopholes that you might see

177
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,720
nowadays no one was really talking about

178
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:21,038
d8 and stuff like that it was just let's

179
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:24,199
find some Fiber seeds let's find some uh

180
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,959
like autoflowering four seed production

181
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,199
seeds of pamp we don't really care let's

182
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:32,158
just get some material like um I think

183
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,320
one thing to note is many times in

184
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,879
biology it is not a game of what's best

185
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,800
but a game of what's first eoli is a

186
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,278
classic Model organism not because it is

187
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,879
the best bacteria but because it is very

188
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,838
easy to find it is in all of us so that

189
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,919
makes it very easy there might be

190
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:53,160
arguably nowadays much better model

191
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:54,639
organms build from but uh eal first so

192
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,120
we were in the same place we just needed

193
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,600
whatever we didn't like we would love to

194
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,360
have worked with really good quality

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,360
substances but um sourcing material was

196
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,600
very tough and it very much mattered I

197
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,360
talked to a lot of lawyers um because

198
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,680
Unicon is Connecticut's Flagship public

199
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,200
State University their legal staff is

200
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,199
essentially the assistant Ag and stuff

201
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,720
like that all of them wanted to talk to

202
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,680
us and make sure that we were

203
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,399
interpreting the farm bill correctly

204
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:28,078
obviously not being lawyers like that

205
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,559
eventually long story short they okayed

206
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:33,559
us to do it and Yukon has a very

207
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:36,639
successful uh hemp program ever

208
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:41,078
since and so were you actually using

209
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:43,600
like low TC hemp or or were you using

210
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:46,838
yeah yeah so I mean the process is the

211
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,879
same yeah Finola I mean much to the

212
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:53,640
point of like using today's

213
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,399
justifications like at that time we're

214
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,480
not flowering anything you know tissue

215
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,039
culture doesn't require any flowering so

216
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,278
whatever material is tested will show up

217
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,519
with the same Tac

218
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,600
as corn Tomatoes whatever you want right

219
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,679
so from that perspective that's what the

220
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,759
farm bill kind of limited us to and we

221
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,759
very much played within that

222
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,000
bounds give muted can you tell us uh

223
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:23,639
which uh strains of uh of cemp were you

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,078
using you said phola yeah so later on I

225
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,159
mean again when we uh initially got

226
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,239
these they were just whatever was

227
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,838
accessible um

228
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,039
eventually once there came time to

229
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,399
publication a lot of journals won't

230
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,838
necessarily accept it's we trust me bro

231
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,039
so it was sent in for genetic

232
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,360
fingerprinting and the closest related

233
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:48,599
other fingerprinted plant was Finola so

234
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,879
it was just subscribed as Finola 2 and

235
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,600
we continued onward um it's a very early

236
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:58,759
flowering hemp variety we use it here

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,800
also we got a lot of hemp here you know

238
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:04,639
like yeah yeah Finola is like you know

239
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:07,479
it's like a standard here it's like

240
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,120
every third field is Finola here because

241
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,039
it's because it's so early you know yeah

242
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,399
it makes little sense um at some point

243
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:19,480
when we eventually switch to American

244
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,278
crops we had like cherry wine

245
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,600
and Abacus I believe was another one

246
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:27,720
yeah at this point unfortunately my

247
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,480
memory is uh is not so great in

248
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,839
2015 16 is becoming further and further

249
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,200
away every year but uh I believe those

250
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,399
were like the major ones and yeah

251
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,440
undeniably the Finola

252
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:43,519
was in many ways very nice because it's

253
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,040
fast growing it's not very hybridized

254
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,560
sew it it just puts out a lot of plant

255
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,838
material not necessarily the greatest

256
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:53,518
morphology but a lot of morphology um

257
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,959
cherry wine Abus were much more they

258
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,360
were more realistically just like

259
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:00,000
traditional cannabis strains that had

260
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,600
generated a knock kned out version of

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,600
the THC syes so now they immediately

262
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,240
became hemp and that made them very

263
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,399
commercially viable because they had

264
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,879
really good metabolic pathways they

265
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,120
produced a lot of CBD and they looked

266
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,639
like commercially viable uh indoor

267
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,839
plants versus Finola sometimes is not M

268
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,440
and you mentioned that uh the papers

269
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:26,720
were published is this something that

270
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,639
anyone can find yeah yeah I mean uh to I

271
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,680
think secure funding you got to keep

272
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,278
public shap in Academia so ever since

273
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,879
I've left um they've been publishing

274
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,879
like like crazy and and if you search

275
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,399
burwitz you'll find brick witz cannabis

276
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:45,320
you'll find a lot of good interviews

277
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,320
that he's done and a lot of his

278
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,919
Publications and so like you said they

279
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,760
are continuing to study um tissue

280
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,120
culture and and hempen and cannabis I

281
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:59,759
think the reality is when you look at

282
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
something in in Academia and it's in

283
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,720
Publications is called an impact factor

284
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,800
you can look at any Journal that you

285
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,800
want plus the word impact factor and

286
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:10,559
it'll tell you a number if that number

287
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,679
is above three it means that it's at

288
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,799
least peer review so a lot of times a

289
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,638
lot of very funky science from a lot of

290
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,198
obscure papers we'll get like a 1.2

291
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,360
publication a 2.3 it means no one looked

292
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:23,479
at it there was no uh journalistic

293
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,399
Insight

294
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,399
right impact factor typically means

295
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,039
impactful to people so Medical journals

296
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,720
are always going to be at the highest of

297
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,519
the impact fact because anything you

298
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,480
discover in medicine is immediately

299
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,919
going to be applicable to many many

300
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,159
people so New England Journal of

301
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,679
Medicine is one of the highest the

302
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,838
Journal of the American Medical

303
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,439
Association jamama is the second highest

304
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,199
they're crazy who Compares something

305
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,120
like science is a 10 the other ones that

306
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,919
I just listed they're 50 plus they're

307
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,679
radically different fall Parts the

308
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,439
highest one in plant plant cell or plant

309
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,919
science depending on which one or plant

310
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,320
physiology um there at like four four

311
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:05,120
and a half five so you can see

312
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,600
traditionally plant research is

313
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,360
considered pretty low impact cannabis

314
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,800
has an incredible benefit in being a

315
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,240
therapeutic plant as well so it

316
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:17,039
traditionally scores much higher so if

317
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,879
you are a plant Department in desperate

318
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,319
need of funding jumping onto cannabis is

319
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,519
an assured way to bump up your

320
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,759
publication scores and potentially

321
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,440
secure better funding and grants in the

322
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,720
future can Connecticut is non

323
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,880
agricultural state so cannabis being

324
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,000
studied at Yukon provided the plant

325
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,958
science department which was a

326
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,839
relatively minor Department I think a

327
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,159
lot of opportunities that traditional

328
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,560
research in like aonia which is a plant

329
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,159
I had never heard of before I worked in

330
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,919
that department uh would probably not

331
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,759
bring to them and that was one that they

332
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,919
were studying and I have not heard of it

333
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,800
since it's interesting that you said

334
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:59,360
that plants um don't get that high of a

335
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:01,319
of a rating but does that include food

336
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,600
yeah yeah I mean like because you would

337
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,800
think like food is medicine and you know

338
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,440
next to water it's one of the most

339
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,679
important things we have on this on this

340
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:15,160
planet it is but you know at the same

341
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,239
time science is not

342
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:20,600
altruistic uh someone is footing the

343
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,320
bill and this always leads to a large

344
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,278
concerning conversation on ethics right

345
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,759
um in the good old days of ISAC no

346
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,838
whatever all of those people every

347
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,159
scientist we've heard of from before

348
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,800
1800s came from an incredibly wealthy

349
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,600
family and usually had a castle that

350
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,799
they were doing all these stuff in their

351
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,120
in their basement of and that's why they

352
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,078
all pursued Alchemy it's obviously been

353
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,519
more democratized since then but it

354
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,758
still needs to be funded uh and the

355
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,639
problem is like like corn or or

356
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,159
agricultural crops in this country Corn

357
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,159
is the largest one that we plant uh 70%

358
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:58,240
of plantable corn is not for food right

359
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:01,078
it's for ethanol production grain feed

360
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,600
stuff that might eventually lead to food

361
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,318
being produced especially for cattle

362
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,000
production but ultimately not calories

363
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:10,198
meant for human

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,759
consumption that ethanol producing corn

365
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:15,159
gets a lot more research into it than it

366
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,560
publicly than food grade corn and food

367
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,799
grade corn is mostly researched by Bayer

368
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,719
and large scale AAL companies and their

369
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:26,318
incentive to share that research is

370
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,639
limited um so it's it's a very

371
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:32,838
fascinating frustrating web but I think

372
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,519
that's B like if you have your own lab

373
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,759
you can study anything you want I think

374
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,839
that's one of the beautiful things about

375
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,560
it there are a lot of for example easy

376
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,319
to cultivate uh organisms like fungi

377
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,039
there are a lot of forgers out there who

378
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,679
will go with a peach dish and they'll

379
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:49,000
isolate fungal isolates right and then

380
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,559
from there if they want to sequence it

381
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,600
that's relatively cost effective they

382
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,879
want to do then computation biology all

383
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,120
that's accessible but to put a academic

384
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,838
lab into that it would be hard to

385
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,759
incentivize some unless there is

386
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,400
financial incentive and cannabis offered

387
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,038
that to a large amount of people I I

388
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,280
always say that I'm recording this

389
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:10,519
podcast for me and if everyone else

390
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,959
likes it then good and I find what

391
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:16,879
you're saying is it's Awakening so you

392
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:20,000
know I I'm enjoying the conversation

393
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,360
it's a perspective of uh somebody who is

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,359
uh like a lab rat right I mean you're

395
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,798
you're somebody from from the science

396
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,519
yeah so people from science and labs

397
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,279
always have uh

398
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,960
perspective which is more realistic than

399
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,839
any others you know what I mean it's

400
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,640
like you like you say Money Rules these

401
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,879
kind of markets right it's like that

402
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,840
it's just even the science behind it

403
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,520
it's ruled by by big Investments and

404
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,599
that's how it's going right I mean the

405
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,279
world is going like this today so we

406
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,159
should be aware that it's going on like

407
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,519
that yeah yeah exactly and I think

408
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,159
similarly

409
00:17:53,519 --> 00:18:00,038
like many good people can be swayed by

410
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,320
many directions you know

411
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,919
sometimes someone can make a decision

412
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,279
that we don't agree with that we might

413
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:06,559
think is moralistically bankrupt but

414
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,558
they have

415
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,639
alternative uh forces that are pushing

416
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,918
them to make these decisions family

417
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,400
members financial crisis whatever it is

418
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:18,038
we should be as understanding as we are

419
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,360
ultimately science isn't good or bad

420
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:22,279
it's purely discovering facts a lot of

421
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:24,439
people like Madam Kerry discovered some

422
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,599
of the most important facts in terms of

423
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,360
radiation how it can develop she

424
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,399
ultimately paid the price for it and her

425
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,399
notebook continue to be so radioactive

426
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,080
that they have to be locked away and can

427
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,480
only be shown behind display right yeah

428
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,960
that is a very altruistic approach to it

429
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,640
and yet it still ultimately she

430
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,600
sacrificed her life I think we're very

431
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,840
fortunate to be playing with cannabis

432
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,158
and while our discoveries are

433
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,279
fascinating they you know stand on the

434
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:53,240
shoulders of of the people who came

435
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:58,079
before

436
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:00,558
us so I think uh you you you started to

437
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,519
talk about before about the how you went

438
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,558
into the program in Connecticut in in

439
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,440
the in the University with this

440
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,798
professor uh can you describe your first

441
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,480
uh years you know how it was for you uh

442
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,038
the failures you know you have to make a

443
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,360
lot of failures I think right sure yeah

444
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:21,960
um so the department that I went to was

445
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,279
very very uh nice very comedy everyone

446
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,240
there was very curious about us starting

447
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:29,918
to pursue into cannabis they all wanted

448
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:34,240
to offer help and me having never or

449
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,400
planted prior was extremely grateful for

450
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,798
any help that could be brought so the

451
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,679
way that you tissue culture arabidopsis

452
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,400
is different than how you tissue culture

453
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,159
tobacco different than how you tissue

454
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,679
culture uh tomatoes and these were

455
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,840
plants that people working with in the

456
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,280
department so they all approached me and

457
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,038
were like maybe this hormone maybe this

458
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,599
concentration of hormones maybe this

459
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:59,919
media base maybe that a lot of failures

460
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:02,599
a lot of frustrations especially ear on

461
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,759
uh very insightful sentiment is we don't

462
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:09,079
know what we don't know so I had no idea

463
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,960
where to even start I had no idea what

464
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:13,480
was deficiency what was toxicity what

465
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,519
played well together what was

466
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,000
synergistic what was

467
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,480
antagonistic eventually though you get

468
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,440
your first success classically I think

469
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,640
the way to build it is like science is

470
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,679
incremental uh success is incremental

471
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,679
you get 5% success before you get 10%

472
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,440
success before you get 20% success

473
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,038
before you get 40% success before you

474
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,279
get 80% success and then at some point

475
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:39,558
you're just def you're just figuring out

476
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,678
what your margin of error is is it 99%

477
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:44,720
99.9%

478
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,440
99.999% and at some point you consider

479
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,679
yourself to

480
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,360
have successfully tissue cultured The

481
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,798
Strain the plant however broad your

482
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:59,119
successes hard um but I can promise you

483
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:02,480
in the beginning it was far away from

484
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:05,479
where we are now almost 10 years later

485
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,159
did you you said this was 2018 so this

486
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,360
was 20

487
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,600
16 yeah

488
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:16,000
2016 did you know the about the

489
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:17,879
advantages of uh of TC tissue tissue

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,720
culture for kobies at that time when you

491
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,000
started you know because today because

492
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,278
of these viruses and pathogens and

493
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,679
endites and all this we know why it's

494
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:30,798
good for or and preserving genetics of

495
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,159
course you know you know small small uh

496
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,839
facility you can preserve like a lot so

497
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,320
did you know that at that time when you

498
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:40,558
started it yeah I think I so I did not

499
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,839
you know one of the realities is an

500
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,480
academic mind and Industrial mind might

501
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,399
be different even though they both at

502
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,640
the fundamental stage are trying to

503
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,278
solve problems the problems that they

504
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,360
might be trying to solve are different

505
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:55,599
in Academia tissue culture is simply a

506
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:59,519
means to an end you almost exclusively

507
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:02,319
use it to propagate or

508
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,519
or cells like Maman tissue culture

509
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,798
bacterial tissue culture fungal tissue

510
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:10,000
culture mostly is done post genetic

511
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:13,240
engineering because you have a cell that

512
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,798
is very easy to engineer you can't like

513
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,000
you can't necessarily do genetic

514
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:19,519
engineering on even two cells because if

515
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,200
you only successfully do one you have a

516
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,918
chimeric organism 50% is genetically

517
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,519
modified and 50% is wild type so you

518
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,520
have to go down to one cell the base

519
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:33,558
Quant of basic basically living biology

520
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:35,558
and then you need to Rumer your organism

521
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:37,839
so you do tissue culture to get out one

522
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:40,440
cell to many cells to an organ to a

523
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:43,798
complex tissue into an organism right

524
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:47,600
that's always how I had been taught

525
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,839
about it had uh seen it utilized in

526
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:54,599
Research

527
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:57,359
Laboratories in Academia and then um in

528
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,199
Industry it was radically different now

529
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,879
we're talking about grow gr High

530
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:06,480
densities of monocultures in in enclosed

531
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,120
environments so the risk of communicable

532
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,720
diseases getting in there and spreading

533
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,759
is much much higher and now using tissue

534
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,720
culture as a means of putting this

535
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,200
potentially SI plant into a pocket of

536
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,960
sterility cleaning it in that pocket of

537
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,360
sterility and then regenerating a clean

538
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,720
plant is a unique to Industry Pursuit

539
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,918
it's not necessarily one that you see

540
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,759
commonly and personally not one that I

541
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,840
had ever seen done in

542
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:38,278
Academia so it was new it was a new way

543
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:43,119
to think about it fortunately the

544
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:46,240
technique and the steps are the same

545
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,918
whether you're reconstituting a cell or

546
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,000
a marem or nose or whatever the timeline

547
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,720
might be just a little bit more

548
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,079
extended is it is the reason why it

549
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,640
wasn't as used with other plants because

550
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:03,199
more of them are seed grown

551
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,480
no so I I don't know if I would say less

552
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,319
used I think the thing is I I meant as

553
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,839
far as like getting rid of virus and

554
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:14,200
disease or maybe I misunderstood you

555
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:17,720
yeah I think the thing is most other

556
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,000
plants have alternative

557
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,079
strategies that are allowed in their

558
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,480
Industries or accepted in their

559
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:26,678
Industries I mean one of the things is

560
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:30,440
like the easiest way to get a

561
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:33,600
PM resistant plant is to find a single

562
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,360
protein that PM uses to latch onto the

563
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,879
plant and either change its confirmation

564
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,918
or remove it entirely and now you don't

565
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,440
have any more pm and now you can just

566
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,960
spray pm on your plants and they'll

567
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,880
never get on you don't have to spray uh

568
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,159
any pesticides anything like that right

569
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,640
but I think the Cannabis community in

570
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,919
general has certain negative attitudes

571
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,038
towards GM crops and that's totally

572
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:59,600
within their respective to hold So

573
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:03,319
within the you know within being again

574
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:06,439
an industry lab that has to

575
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:09,038
uh be aware of people's attitudes and

576
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,880
pressures you want to do what is most

577
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,519
susceptible in the industry so tissue

578
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,399
culture has been forced that way I think

579
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,240
if you look at how to remediate like

580
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:18,519
Hops and vroid which is not necessarily

581
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,399
spread to a lot of other plants but

582
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,599
there are other viroids much to your

583
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:25,479
point that have spread to other

584
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:28,000
plants they are usually remediated in

585
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:32,798
other ways and maybe sometimes they do

586
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,759
use stuff like marem and thermal uh

587
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,879
combinatorial methods but often times

588
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,798
they'll use something different that

589
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,840
we're just not using in the canis

590
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:44,480
industry like a chemical application

591
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,278
yeah yeah or like as you know mention

592
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,480
like genetic engineering crops are very

593
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:50,398
common

594
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,679
go so in America you're not allowed to

595
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:55,439
buy directly genetic engineered crops

596
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,320
that's slowly changing under the last

597
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,880
two

598
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:02,480
administrations um but like genetically

599
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,640
engineered byproducts are very allowed

600
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,159
in food so go pick up a Snickers bar

601
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,520
it'll say right on there made with

602
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:12,080
genetically bioengineered or whatever

603
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:14,839
terminology they're trying to use um

604
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,759
that's more accepted in their Pursuits I

605
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,240
think cannabis has a very holistic

606
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,640
attitude and you know we should be

607
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,240
really respectful of that and so part of

608
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,038
that leads to yeah marem is the industry

609
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,240
accepted way of remediating something

610
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:33,119
like hopside and vroid and it works so

611
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,240
before we get too much into that I

612
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,398
wanted to ask you about you mentioned

613
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,319
ethics and I'm wondering when you went

614
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:42,079
to the

615
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:45,960
university you know if this was a

616
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:49,879
question of them you know like was there

617
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:53,440
any you said um Professor burwitz you

618
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,640
know immediately was was you know hip to

619
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,360
the idea of of doing this study but was

620
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:02,080
there any push back from any of the

621
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:05,079
other members of of the facil of the

622
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,079
University

623
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:12,599
so I'm sure if I really thought about

624
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:15,038
it potentially right because similarly

625
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,678
the university is not a monolith many of

626
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,679
the professors come from different

627
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,798
countries that have varying different

628
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,919
attitudes some even more positive and

629
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:27,679
some potentially more negative towards

630
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:30,159
cannabis drug research in general um so

631
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,640
it probably be naive to say there wasn't

632
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,919
any push back to say that I experienced

633
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,880
any of it would uh I can certainly say

634
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,759
no like I was in the plant science

635
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,480
department at this point um pretty much

636
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:46,558
everyone I knew in the mular biology

637
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,558
Department smoked a lot of the

638
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,440
professors smoked it was not certainly

639
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:54,960
talked about very readily but uh there

640
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,880
was a moment where one of my best

641
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,519
friends who was doing his graduate

642
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,679
program at the same time as I his

643
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,640
Professor was about to publish and his

644
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,440
protocol for publishing was to basically

645
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,320
go home lock himself away for two weeks

646
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,558
to write the whole manuscript and just

647
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,480
smoke like a pound of weed during that

648
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,038
time so he asked me to help him procure

649
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,240
the pound of weed for the professor to

650
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,480
go because I was in the in the program

651
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,200
and I'm like as many times I to tell

652
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,759
people you know this is hemp this not

653
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,640
obviously what the program is for the

654
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,640
professor got what he needed um so my

655
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,919
experience with what with it was almost

656
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,080
like everyone was fascinated like

657
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,000
everyone is doing fascinating research

658
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,720
on this illness that plant this organism

659
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,599
whatever it was but we were kind of

660
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,278
doing the cool thing the taboo thing

661
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,678
with cannabis so a lot of people were

662
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,679
like you know what are you guys going on

663
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,960
what kind of like how are you guys going

664
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,159
to tackle this approach let me give you

665
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:55,519
your mind to something it was very very

666
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:56,880
enthusiastic that's cool yeah and and so

667
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,880
from there when you started to have

668
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:05,840
success you made your own company kic

669
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:09,080
yeah yeah so when I left um when I left

670
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:11,599
Yukon I had already had some very

671
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,879
positive uh industry connections that I

672
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,038
had talked to just from being with Yukon

673
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,480
a lot of you know people in industry for

674
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:20,440
example like we talk about funding

675
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,079
because at the time and I mean still

676
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,558
techn is cannabis is schedule one a

677
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:30,639
federally illegal substance and Yukon is

678
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:33,519
a federally uh funded school if we were

679
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,759
to use federal funds on cannabis there

680
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,440
was a risk or a concern that all federal

681
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:40,960
funding for the entire school every

682
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,519
unrelated Department from psychology to

683
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,679
puppetry to everything that got any

684
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,519
federal federal funding would get their

685
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,919
Federal funding pulled obviously in

686
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,159
addition to usense prop that's why I

687
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:55,000
asked the question about ethics and push

688
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,480
back well so that's fair from a funding

689
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,519
perspective we couldn't write a

690
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,319
traditional Grant and and go through

691
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,440
that type of process which is what every

692
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,480
other laboratory in that department was

693
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,360
basically doing we had to go and find

694
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,159
industry Partners Connecticut at the

695
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:14,959
time had cure Leaf which is a major MSO

696
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,320
um I think that was pretty much the only

697
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,880
MSO at that time since then a few others

698
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:25,798
have moved in but they were essentially

699
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:28,399
uh like Angel Investing and funding this

700
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,038
um and that was like the only way way we

701
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:33,038
could get uh it to go forward we were

702
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,440
very fortunate they literally never

703
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:39,200
asked anything one of the nice things

704
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,120
about this is It's a pretty NE uh Niche

705
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,278
nuanced science so it's hard to make

706
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:47,839
demands like you might expect an

707
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:50,200
investor to do if they don't

708
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,759
necessarily understand what's going on

709
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,720
they're more just like excited at the

710
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,679
research is happening and probably

711
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,000
realistically it's a it's a mechanism

712
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,440
for them to say like we are supporting

713
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,599
research and stuff like that they never

714
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,038
asked us what our Ro of progress was

715
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:10,240
they never asked us what we were doing

716
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:12,798
they were just very kind so by Angel

717
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,278
Investing that means that they weren't

718
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,720
trying to make a profit that they were

719
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,720
doing it because they believed that it

720
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:24,120
was a good thing to do I promise you

721
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,880
they made no profit they exclusively H

722
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:29,079
merged money into that lab and then

723
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,360
again because public University

724
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:32,398
everything even though it was still

725
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:34,719
privately funded everything that was

726
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:38,278
discovered and published is published in

727
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,480
public you know uh journals not given to

728
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,159
them you know exclusively Stu like that

729
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,839
so yeah they exclusively lost money I

730
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,880
think this was just uh a check that they

731
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,558
were comfortable to write and then

732
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,519
forget about must be nice to have that

733
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,038
type of money hopefully someday I will

734
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,720
and I'll be able to be an angel investor

735
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:59,240
for for good causes like that as well

736
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,679
but I mean that's just it's an

737
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,638
incredible thing to think about yeah we

738
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,639
were incredibly

739
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:09,839
grateful and so I wanted to just take a

740
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:11,719
step back and say or ask the company

741
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,959
that you used to work for in cannabis

742
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,440
they told you or they asked you if you

743
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,840
were you would look into tissue culture

744
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,759
and you went and did that but you never

745
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:25,359
returned back to that company yeah so

746
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:26,519
when I was there I was um incredibly

747
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,319
grateful for the

748
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:32,399
opportunity um

749
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:34,079
they initially brought me in to help in

750
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,000
the lab in the in the extraction

751
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:39,879
laboratory but had asked me to you know

752
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,200
one day do tissue culture and I was like

753
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,159
great I know how to do that with

754
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,240
bacteria fungi all the stuff that I've

755
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:50,720
done in Academia but not not uh plants

756
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,240
and that was what led me as I mentioned

757
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,759
to asking uh do burkowitz about his lab

758
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,519
and stuff like that and then him asking

759
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,079
me to work there

760
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,079
when he offered that

761
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,879
opportunity it

762
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:09,359
was it was incredibly hard to think

763
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,200
about returning back to this facility

764
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,918
and knowing that like while my

765
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,240
opportunity to grow in that facility uh

766
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,159
and in that company was was high and I

767
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,399
and I believe that they you know have a

768
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,240
really good corporate uh structure and

769
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:26,439
they promote from within so so it was

770
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,359
really tantalizing my capacity to learn

771
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,240
would probably have never been as high

772
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,119
as if I had stayed in school and just

773
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,558
committed a few more years and

774
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,479
ultimately that's just what I decided to

775
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:39,599
do I think for a very short period of

776
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:42,798
time I would help out at the lab and

777
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:46,000
then do school work but ultimately stuck

778
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,759
with school and you know very thankful

779
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,119
for making that decision back then that

780
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,158
was another question I was going to ask

781
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:54,398
is you were still considered a student

782
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,559
you weren't like working for the school

783
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:59,719
you were a student and you were he was a

784
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:59,720
graduate okay

785
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,319
nice and so when at what point did you

786
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:11,119
stop this endeavor at the school and and

787
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:15,759
take it to the next step so in

788
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,039
2018 basically um finished up at Yukon

789
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,040
and then

790
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:22,079
I yeah was very poorly planned I mean I

791
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,519
knew I was

792
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,879
leaving everything was set in stone I

793
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:28,679
had met with all my committees and stuff

794
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:31,039
like that but

795
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,159
planning job hunting all that type of

796
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,800
stuff I was so focused on finishing all

797
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,760
my research and stuff like that to make

798
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,839
sure that I could just clean slate leave

799
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,720
uh it was a little

800
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:46,799
shortsighted so I I got fortunate to

801
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,559
help someone with their with the grow

802
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,720
operation and that provided the neste to

803
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:54,878
essentially start kinomic and as soon as

804
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:58,480
I could was started it so within 6

805
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:01,440
months we had some operating agreement

806
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,079
we had a lease and a dream and we were

807
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,000
Off to the Races and when you started

808
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:12,200
konic was the plan to do um tissue

809
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,639
culture for others or to to be like a

810
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:16,519
genetic repository like you know you

811
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,358
guys are doing with the grateful Head or

812
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,800
sure so initially it was actually just

813
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:23,880
to do classes um and that's basically

814
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,200
what we did for the first two and a half

815
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,440
years we were just offering tissue

816
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:29,000
culture classes come in we'll show you

817
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,760
how to micropropagation show you how to

818
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,480
do marem make media whatever it is right

819
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:40,240
synthetic seeds for a while um and then

820
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,920
at one point the the classes were a

821
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:45,358
little bit of a premium because

822
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,159
self-funded class uh self-funded lab so

823
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:52,838
um the people that were coming into the

824
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:54,679
classes were people like skunk VA and

825
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:57,400
incred I was going to mention him so

826
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:59,318
incredible individuals in the industry

827
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,760
and essentially at one point I was

828
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:03,880
looking at the people that I knew my

829
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,079
role ofex for lack of a better term and

830
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,838
was realizing that it was an incredible

831
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,318
uh list of individuals like an

832
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:14,440
incredible

833
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:17,358
combination um so once that realization

834
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,960
happened the opportunity to expand

835
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:24,119
Beyond classes started to

836
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,679
conceptualize uh forming a network of

837
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,519
people that really understood the plant

838
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:32,078
really understood

839
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:35,559
the uh Legacy of the plant especially

840
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,400
within the community and the genetics of

841
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:41,719
the plant itself

842
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,920
was just again yet another opportunity

843
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:50,039
that I could not afford to let slip by

844
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:52,800
so for a very long time we had genetics

845
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,440
that were just our own we never really

846
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,000
worried about it we' usually just tell

847
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,639
people to go to other Fant ftic

848
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
companies within the industry if they

849
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:03,480
were looking for stuff like that and we

850
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,358
were just focused on education so you

851
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,760
weren't even doing lab work for other

852
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:10,559
people like multiplying their plants or

853
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,680
cleaning their plants and tissue culture

854
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,679
you were just doing the classes yeah um

855
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:19,480
we so we did consults we helped people

856
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:21,399
establish their own Labs um but yeah

857
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,039
like we we were doing a lot of tissue

858
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,160
culture work for No One But ourselves

859
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:29,440
essentially and and you know essentially

860
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,318
like again like in Academia to prove

861
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,880
something you really just need three

862
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:36,719
successful plans to show that it can be

863
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,000
done that it's that you can replicate it

864
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,199
that's what the second PL and that you

865
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,920
can have an average that's what the

866
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:45,598
third plant does right in Industry you

867
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,760
need to be like you know 95% efficient

868
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:52,800
you so getting that level of efficiency

869
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,160
and again really just a mind shift there

870
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,720
there was a lag on on me personally So

871
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:02,239
eventually industry mind kicked in and

872
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:06,159
the opportunity that we were sitting on

873
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:09,639
uh finally clicked um leading to where

874
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:13,639
we are now yeah the grateful Head yeah

875
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:16,759
when uh when I spoke to Jason VA skunk

876
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:19,000
about um you being on the show he was he

877
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,839
was quite excited and he was like that's

878
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,760
my

879
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:25,239
teacher and you know a great guy I

880
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,800
wasn't going to name drop him I never

881
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:29,679
know how he likes to roll but uh out in

882
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,119
the public now people know that he goes

883
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,759
by Jason and and frankly

884
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:37,400
uh I think I've outed him already a few

885
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,880
times so so he's out there I'm happy to

886
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,880
write on your coiles and say that Jason

887
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,559
is a fantastic but nobody knows him as

888
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Jason so even when I say Jason I always

889
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,519
have to say Jason VA skunk that way

890
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,400
everyone really knows who we're talking

891
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,239
about but yeah he's been telling me

892
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,920
about his tissue culture Journey now for

893
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,959
a few years um when did he study with

894
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,079
you do you

895
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:03,000
remember h is going to be a bad clip but

896
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:06,079
I believe he took it in

897
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
2022 actually actually I think I know

898
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,480
exactly when he took it I think he took

899
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,599
it

900
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,599
in

901
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,000
June

902
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,000
or oh man going backwards in the month

903
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,280
may may is before June I think he took

904
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,639
it one of those two months because after

905
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:29,480
that I took a uh extended like holiday

906
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:32,559
and when I came back our first month in

907
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,119
September our neighbors their facility

908
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,119
caught on fire and they flooded our

909
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,079
facility because our spinker system went

910
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,640
off with the smoke which propped us

911
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,440
leaving Western Massachusetts and moving

912
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:48,879
to Maine so I believe he was in the

913
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,559
last successful class because quite

914
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,358
literally that fire happened during a

915
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,960
class so we had to do marem day at my

916
00:39:53,358 --> 00:40:00,679
house was was exciting but um he took

917
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,039
that believe and if not Jason I'm sorry

918
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:04,118
correct director I don't think it

919
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:07,679
matters that much

920
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:10,039
um but like I said I had talked to him

921
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,039
like after him doing your class and he's

922
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,639
setting up his lab and he's so excited

923
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:17,318
about it and you know I'll tell I'll

924
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:20,400
take a minute to tell a little bit about

925
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:23,239
my tissue culture journey and we spoke

926
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,599
about it a little bit um before we

927
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:28,439
recorded um and you know we mentioned

928
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:32,240
Bill Graham

929
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:35,559
he made the uh home tissue culture kits

930
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,919
mic and yeah and what' you say the

931
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:41,480
microcone kit yeah the microcone kit and

932
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,119
so my funny story about the microcone

933
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:49,159
kit is first of all I I knew Bill Graham

934
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:51,720
from before he ever um was doing you

935
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:55,358
know the microcone kit he owned the

936
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:57,919
hydroponic shop in San Jose I think it

937
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:00,119
was called Pure Foods

938
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,680
and you know he also did some wholesale

939
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:06,640
distribution so me being in in the grow

940
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:11,358
shop business I knew him for a while

941
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:14,519
and um I remember also we went to Epcot

942
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:17,279
Center and at Epcot Center they have

943
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:19,880
this place called the land and in the

944
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,560
land you could you could buy tissue

945
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,200
culture plants it's actually the only

946
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:29,239
place that I've ever seen that you can

947
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:30,358
buy plants like in in vitro in the gel

948
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:33,959
you know they'll sell them to you there

949
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:35,519
and we we bought some redwood trees and

950
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,838
I don't remember what else they s the

951
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,719
the redwood trees is the one that I

952
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:42,078
really

953
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:45,559
remember and um after that you know Bill

954
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,800
had his microcone kit and I was super

955
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:51,880
excited about it right so you know I

956
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,920
bought the kit and I think that this is

957
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,039
very similar to what a lot of my clients

958
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,159
did was I bought the kit

959
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:02,838
and I did nothing with it for years and

960
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:05,759
the reason why I didn't do it was

961
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:07,799
because I felt like I needed to be ready

962
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,720
I need to make the space I need you know

963
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,720
and I really had to just get my head

964
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:17,559
around the idea of doing it and so

965
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,759
literally I kept the kit for over a year

966
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:22,159
might have you know the ingredients

967
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:25,480
might have already been bad in it and

968
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:27,639
you know one day bill came to my store

969
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:32,800
and he said we're just going to do this

970
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:35,679
right now and I'm like what and you know

971
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,720
I had a retail store mhm you know and we

972
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:40,799
did it right in the middle of our retail

973
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:43,719
store with the front door opening with a

974
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,960
rubber made tough box turned on its

975
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:50,199
side and we divided up um some redwood

976
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,838
trees the other thing that we divided I

977
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:54,399
don't know if we got if he bought that

978
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:57,199
at um Epcot or if it was something he

979
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,358
had was scented geranium with the

980
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,000
divided some of

981
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:03,039
those and

982
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,119
unbelievably it all

983
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:09,639
worked and there was no contamination

984
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:12,119
like zero I don't know if he puts like

985
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:13,199
preservatives into his system or or want

986
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,280
to make it so that there's no

987
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:19,598
contamination but for someone that had

988
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:22,319
no experience using scalpel and forceps

989
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,599
and the front door opening and just

990
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,759
working in this Rubbermaid tough box mhm

991
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,800
to see that that actually

992
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,760
worked was really inspiring for me and

993
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,920
so at that point I started doing tissue

994
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:41,920
culture right there in the middle of my

995
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:44,960
store every day and I had um 2x4 grow

996
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:48,680
tent that had four shelves on it and

997
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,240
that thing was just packed M with jars

998
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:52,558
of plants that were growing and I even

999
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,399
shared a picture with you and I I'll put

1000
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:59,280
it up in the video of I had and this one

1001
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:02,559
of my shock ly proudest plant moments

1002
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,599
scented Bonia was blooming in the jar

1003
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:08,559
you know and I I just think it was so

1004
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,359
incredible that that that happened the

1005
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,800
redwood trees were super easy to grow

1006
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,639
you know they'd grow we'd cut it up into

1007
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,519
a million pieces put it in there and

1008
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:23,000
they would just grow and so before you

1009
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:25,159
knew it I had this tent filled with

1010
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,599
tissue culture plants at that point I

1011
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:30,960
still hadn't ever done cannabis

1012
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,000
and I was able to inspire people to

1013
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,880
purchase the kit okay and we got you

1014
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,719
know I don't know maybe a couple of

1015
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,400
dozen people that purchased the kit and

1016
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:45,159
no one used it for the very same reason

1017
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,920
that when I started my tissue culture

1018
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:49,719
Journey well there was actually two

1019
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,280
reasons number one was the intimidation

1020
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:54,358
Factor right the other thing that

1021
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,720
stopped people from doing it was they

1022
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,239
didn't get the it wasn't helping them

1023
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,078
now

1024
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,919
I told people hey look if you do this

1025
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,640
tissue culture you'll be lucky if you

1026
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,000
have plants that you can take out of

1027
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,318
tissue culture and actually use in your

1028
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,679
garden in 6 to 9 months because the

1029
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:14,000
sterilization process is super stressful

1030
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,279
then they got to grow and then you got

1031
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,760
to divide them before you do it and so

1032
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,559
because they weren't getting I don't

1033
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,040
want to say immediate satisfaction but

1034
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,960
immediate

1035
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:27,159
benefit they never did it and like

1036
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,838
literally I can say with confidence zero

1037
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:32,519
0% of the people that I sold that kit

1038
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:35,119
ever used it sure and

1039
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:37,599
so one day I went over to my buddy's

1040
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,200
house just like Bill Graham and said

1041
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,720
that's it we're going to do it you know

1042
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:46,960
because I wasn't growing cannabis at the

1043
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:49,399
time when I had my retail shop and um so

1044
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,960
I said you know we're going to do this

1045
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,680
and we did um nodle tissue culture of

1046
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,960
course wasn't doing

1047
00:45:54,679 --> 00:46:01,598
marem and again

1048
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,679
worked and the plants kind of looked a

1049
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,480
little bit weird which is something that

1050
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:09,480
I wanted to talk to you about um they

1051
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,599
were like a bit glassy the leaves were

1052
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:17,119
like you know like shiny and very

1053
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:21,838
transparent and even looking a little

1054
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:24,519
bit fragile sure but they grew yeah and

1055
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,279
you know the mistake that I made and

1056
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:28,920
I've actually made this mistake multiple

1057
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,920
times was

1058
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,000
I didn't take it to the next step the

1059
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,318
plants would grow into the top of the

1060
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,239
jar and eventually they'd start to get

1061
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:40,119
damaged because they needed to be you

1062
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:43,598
know

1063
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:48,200
moved and yeah that's pretty much where

1064
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:51,440
my tissue culture Journey ended I

1065
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:53,799
never took those plants divided them

1066
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,159
although I know that I had already

1067
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,920
accomplished the hardest part was

1068
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:01,799
sanitizing the plant because you know

1069
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,880
when I so I I rarely got

1070
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,480
contamination but it was common that the

1071
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,000
plants would get damaged in the

1072
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,960
sanitization process and they would just

1073
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,679
never survive you know putting them into

1074
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:18,159
the

1075
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:21,440
gel um but I never like I said I never

1076
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:23,480
divided them again and at that point I

1077
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,838
wouldn't have needed to sanitize them

1078
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,639
again because they were clean they were

1079
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:33,358
living in the jar for some time nothing

1080
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:37,159
is growing in the agar so I I don't you

1081
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:40,078
know so it's just again at this point I

1082
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:43,598
wish that I would have taken that next

1083
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,519
step and what I wanted to say is in

1084
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:50,400
talking with Jason and hearing about the

1085
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:52,838
Grateful head and also um we have

1086
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,680
another host on our show he goes by

1087
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:56,880
Cosmic and

1088
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:58,838
unfortunately um he doesn't make his

1089
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,640
living in cannabis you know it's just

1090
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:05,920
his passion um he has home tissue

1091
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:09,159
culture set up but he does

1092
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,400
maristan and what you know he learned

1093
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:14,759
how to do this on his own by like

1094
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,200
reading books and YouTube videos and

1095
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,040
stuff like that

1096
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:22,480
but he never used

1097
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:23,318
hormones he just puts it I believe in

1098
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,920
the

1099
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:30,159
agar and I forget what the stuff is

1100
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,400
called mus mus or something like that M

1101
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:37,318
scoo yeah I M is what most people call

1102
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:41,160
it yeah and but yeah he doesn't use the

1103
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:46,279
hormones and the plants grow from a

1104
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:47,960
meristem sample into plants so I guess

1105
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,798
now that I told a little bit of my story

1106
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,159
in tissue culture well before I do as I

1107
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:55,880
want to say is I'm re inspired to learn

1108
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:57,480
more about tissue culture because of

1109
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:02,519
cosmic

1110
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:05,280
and you and um Jason VA skunk and what

1111
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:08,159
the grateful Head are doing now I want

1112
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,599
to continue this journey and I have a

1113
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:14,118
little spot at a friend's house that

1114
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,920
he's built a tissue culture lab I'm

1115
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:20,559
going to share some pictures with you

1116
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,838
and with everybody um so I want to learn

1117
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,960
about it not because I want to make it

1118
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:27,279
into a business I maybe that'll happen

1119
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,358
someday but more because

1120
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,960
I just want to learn about the pro

1121
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:34,000
process and I want to be able to

1122
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,318
preserve my

1123
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,798
genetics and all right so still got to

1124
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:40,199
like just wipe the floor up a little bit

1125
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:43,079
but this is

1126
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:46,960
our little like kind of scuttle room to

1127
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:49,960
change in and right here we'll have

1128
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,559
a got lap fridge set up there's going to

1129
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,039
be a rack for tisue cultures with a

1130
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:56,480
bunch of intelligence

1131
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,798
to call me if there's problems L on our

1132
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,358
Hood got the mini extra linar hood for

1133
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:02,440
doing the marem

1134
00:50:00,358 --> 00:50:03,838
stuff yeah all the tissue culture

1135
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,599
vessels and [ __ ] and I'll be able to

1136
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:08,759
fill this all up with like 200 ball jars

1137
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:12,240
so that'll be our start starting uh next

1138
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:14,920
week I hope you know while there are

1139
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,679
other people doing it you know that

1140
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,240
there's places that will Bank your

1141
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:21,480
genetics it kind of becomes expensive

1142
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:23,239
after a while you know and so for what

1143
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,400
it costs to bank some

1144
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:29,519
genetics you can you know learn how to

1145
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,160
do it maybe and sure you know I also

1146
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,519
like the idea of being in charge of my

1147
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:38,000
own destiny you know so I want to learn

1148
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:41,199
about tissue culture and um I noticed

1149
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,159
and you know we tell everyone that um

1150
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:46,318
Philip is still doing the

1151
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:49,879
classes and uh if you go look at

1152
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:54,000
his I'll I'll include the link on the

1153
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,880
description but on the conomic Instagram

1154
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,639
he has a link tree that takes you to his

1155
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:03,480
website where you can see the services

1156
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:07,039
that he provides so um

1157
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,400
sure uh more than happy to except I'm

1158
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:09,519
going to do something totally different

1159
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,599
I'm going to address a bunch of the

1160
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,480
stuff that you said okay the glassy

1161
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:17,039
leaves That's a classic condition called

1162
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:20,199
hyper hydrosity it's quite literally

1163
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:21,838
these plants are in an environment that

1164
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:24,399
often when you put them in there the the

1165
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:27,558
agar's been poured it's cooled and and

1166
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:30,000
dried and uh the en is dry right so you

1167
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,599
put a plant in there the Agger is mostly

1168
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,920
water so in this open room the plant is

1169
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:37,079
going to start pulling water from the

1170
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,200
Agger and any nutrients hormones

1171
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,318
whatever else is in that media mix will

1172
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,439
come into the plant too and then it will

1173
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:45,279
start transpiring the water out of the

1174
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,200
leaves as it produces new leaves and

1175
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,880
stuff like that right and you'll

1176
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:51,000
eventually see condensation form in your

1177
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,119
container because it's essentially a

1178
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,239
humidity dome but humidity domes often

1179
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:59,000
allow the humidity to vent a tissue

1180
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,358
culture because the container is often

1181
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,880
fully sealed maybe a small vent at the

1182
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:08,000
top you'll reach an equilibrium where

1183
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:10,680
there will be saturation of water in the

1184
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,880
air leading to condensation just like it

1185
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:14,879
does when you take a hot shower on your

1186
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,640
window on your mirror the only reason

1187
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,119
that's happening is because the air has

1188
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,798
cond has saturation so it's looking for

1189
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,160
somewhere else to stick and the walls of

1190
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:24,880
the container are't easy to do that when

1191
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:29,118
you use especially some hormones like

1192
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,760
cyto and especially TDC which I know uh

1193
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:35,200
is very commonly used in in canti

1194
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:38,000
culture it will promote hyper hydrosity

1195
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:43,199
it essentially forces the plant to keep

1196
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:47,599
suing you say tdz or tdt tdz yeah side

1197
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:50,960
Dion right that was one of the um one of

1198
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:54,119
the kits that I got I'm very familiar um

1199
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:57,240
and so it what it'll do is like normally

1200
00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:00,079
under regular biological regulation

1201
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:03,159
once you reach saturation plants will

1202
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,400
stop pulling in water and stop

1203
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:06,920
transpiring water which will slow down

1204
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,160
their growth because all of the

1205
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,760
nutrients and all the hormones are in

1206
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:13,920
the water in the Ager it's a hydroponic

1207
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,880
system so the more water they pull

1208
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,639
through and push out of their leaves the

1209
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,039
more nutrients the more hormones are

1210
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:22,719
getting through them some hormones can

1211
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:23,960
force them to do it beyond the regular

1212
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:25,798
regulation this is basically what

1213
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,519
hormones are designed to do are to

1214
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:30,719
override regulatory just like adrenaline

1215
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,838
overrides your regular normal state of

1216
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,558
being but then very quickly has to go

1217
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:36,199
away because you can't live your life on

1218
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:40,680
adrenaline we'd all die of cardiac

1219
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:43,399
arasin in our 30s um something like cyto

1220
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:47,039
especially tdz will continue to force

1221
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:50,280
the plant to push pull in water and push

1222
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:53,119
it out which leads to hyper hydros it's

1223
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,760
beyond a saturated level of water and

1224
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:59,760
the plant morphology especially looks

1225
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:02,079
incredibly glassy not very good um

1226
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,119
venting helps that lowering your plant

1227
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:08,760
density helps that uh just as two very

1228
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:11,039
easy ways I wasn't venting when I first

1229
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,280
started that you know I didn't even

1230
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,239
think that that was was an option and

1231
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,960
the last time I did tissue culture which

1232
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:22,558
was a year ago I did buy some little

1233
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:24,440
stickers that you could drill a hole in

1234
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:28,359
the top of your container and then you

1235
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:30,000
put that sticker on and I I mean I'm

1236
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:33,318
assuming that it was a combination of

1237
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,960
both things that first is that I was

1238
00:54:33,318 --> 00:54:40,519
venting them but also at that point Bill

1239
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:43,798
Graham had like multiple different uh

1240
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:48,480
kits some that had tdz and then some

1241
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:50,599
that had other um hormones in there and

1242
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,240
you know this last time that I did it I

1243
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:57,240
didn't have that problem of the glassy

1244
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,239
leaves

1245
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:09,119
makes total sense

1246
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:12,039
um and then another one distract you no

1247
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,720
no no no I you're totally good uh my

1248
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:18,279
ADHD rattled mind uh is never going to

1249
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:20,919
be so good at one topic but I Remember

1250
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,280
You also mentioned when the plants would

1251
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,440
hit the upper threshold of the

1252
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:27,000
containers right so plants have no

1253
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,440
natural

1254
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,119
defense or strategy for an upper limit

1255
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,920
like that that they're the tallest

1256
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,039
growing thing in every environment and

1257
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,798
and except for shade crop and shade crop

1258
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:41,079
grows radically different than a tall

1259
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:42,798
growing plant like cannabis right so

1260
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:44,440
tall growing plants like cannabis they

1261
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,358
have one plan right they hit something

1262
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,200
they try to bend and grow around it it's

1263
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:50,400
basically it gibberella ends up work and

1264
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:51,960
what you probably saw is they'll hit it

1265
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,240
and then they'll start going like this

1266
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,280
they're trying to go around they're

1267
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:59,078
trying to sense it eventually when it

1268
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,039
izes it has nowhere to go it will self

1269
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:05,400
toop it will literally necr necrotize

1270
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:07,319
its own apical node and let the lateral

1271
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:10,920
node start shooting off because maybe

1272
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:13,079
they'll have a chance to bypass this

1273
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,280
upper threshold that is preventing it

1274
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:16,960
from growing right when those lateral

1275
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,559
nodes hit the top and they also die

1276
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,920
usually the whole plant just has no

1277
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,599
backup being plan and and that's

1278
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,960
probably what you saw you probably saw

1279
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,440
it hit the top this top part just kind

1280
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,880
of Dy and look sad and the side broke

1281
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:32,039
like a top go but then eventually the

1282
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,440
plan doesn't know what to do anymore um

1283
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:35,400
and then

1284
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,159
finally what I'll say is the hardest

1285
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,079
part of tissue culture is always going

1286
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:42,358
to be organogenesis growing a new organ

1287
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,880
out of your plant so for noal

1288
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:46,798
micropropagation that means rooting your

1289
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,960
plant I mean think about traditional

1290
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:52,079
propagation one my not growing without

1291
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,039
roots no no that's super easy the

1292
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,559
easiest thing in the world right um so

1293
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:57,280
think about like a classic plant that

1294
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:01,480
you have right now now a veggie plant

1295
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:03,079
right you cut it you dip it in clonex 10

1296
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,719
days 14 days from now there's going to

1297
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:07,599
be Roots at the base of the plant right

1298
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:08,919
where did that primordial original root

1299
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,880
Cell come

1300
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,480
from where did it come from where did

1301
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,079
that initial root cell that made the

1302
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,760
second root sell that made a clump of

1303
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,280
roots that little white nodule that

1304
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,760
eventually made the full grown root

1305
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,400
right how did that happen I mean that

1306
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,240
happens every time I've never seen your

1307
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,079
Gardens and I can guess that's what

1308
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,679
happens because it's not coincidental

1309
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:28,720
it's mechanistic

1310
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:30,919
what's the underlying mechanism right

1311
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:33,558
the under the underlying mechanism is

1312
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:36,480
that you are changing the cellular

1313
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:39,039
identity of those branch cells at the at

1314
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,000
near the injury site and you're telling

1315
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:45,039
them to stop being uh Branch cells

1316
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,400
become stem cells quite literally uh

1317
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:49,359
callous and out of that callus because

1318
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,519
callus naturally wants to bias towards

1319
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:55,960
Roots they root all under the direction

1320
00:57:52,519 --> 00:58:00,159
of Iva right the active ingredi clonex

1321
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:03,159
and AA IA whatever oxin you're using um

1322
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:05,838
so in tissue culture if you don't close

1323
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:07,838
the wound you can just keep it going

1324
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:09,920
indefinitely because you're not growing

1325
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:12,159
new organs you're just letting the

1326
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,358
organs you have keep producing new ones

1327
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,519
you have already a node so the node will

1328
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:17,880
grow into a branch which has many nodes

1329
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:20,318
which can grow into many branches which

1330
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,838
will all have many nodes growing The

1331
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,480
Roots out of it is the hardest part it's

1332
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:26,318
why it's the only part of our entire

1333
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,318
growth cycle where the plant doesn't

1334
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:31,759
grow at all for two weeks just freaking

1335
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:34,599
chills while it commits all of its

1336
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,720
metabolic energy to generating a new

1337
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:38,920
organ and then once it has that organ it

1338
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,838
starts growing and then your clone grows

1339
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,798
and then your veg grows and your flower

1340
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:46,440
explodes and grow right but your clone

1341
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:48,159
before it Roots it's not growing at all

1342
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,920
and what you said Phil was really

1343
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:56,519
interesting that growing The Roots is

1344
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:57,920
the hardest part and I agree that you

1345
00:58:56,519 --> 00:59:00,440
know when we're not thinking about

1346
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,920
tissue culture one of the most magical

1347
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,798
things that we do with these plants is

1348
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:08,798
take a cutting and get them to root it's

1349
00:59:05,798 --> 00:59:12,639
it's a pretty incredible thing to to do

1350
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:15,639
and make happen and multiply plants um

1351
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:20,400
but for someone and for people that have

1352
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:22,318
been cloning cannabis for many years mhm

1353
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,318
maybe it's not the most difficult thing

1354
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:28,000
but the most amazing thing for us to see

1355
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:30,679
is a plant growing without

1356
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,480
roots so what I would say classically is

1357
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:37,038
like tissue culture is one of these

1358
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:40,119
relatively new techniques right when

1359
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:43,319
once like you're saying once we anything

1360
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:45,960
that isn't normalized is magical and

1361
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:48,440
once it becomes normalized it's just

1362
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,798
science because it's understood right so

1363
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:53,039
like if you were at a party in the year

1364
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:55,000
2000 and you had an aeroc cloner and you

1365
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,760
were telling people you cloned in the

1366
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,400
air did look at you like you were lying

1367
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,039
to them or a warlock right one of those

1368
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,440
two but now if you tell people you clone

1369
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,760
in the air they'd be like yeah I totally

1370
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,240
understand because I've seen a lot of a

1371
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:11,680
cloners it's no longer magical it's just

1372
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:13,959
science dish culture is the same like

1373
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:15,879
thinking a plant can't survive 20

1374
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:18,760
minutes in bleach and a little bit of

1375
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:23,599
soap and then being put into a pressure

1376
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:26,359
cooked media is Fantastical because it's

1377
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:29,119
foreign but when you do it much like

1378
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:31,960
cloning it it just becomes a job right

1379
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:34,440
and then like to many people who pursue

1380
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,079
gardening as a hobby they have a

1381
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,200
radically different relationship than

1382
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:42,200
people who pursue agriculture as a

1383
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,960
profession and they're growing thousands

1384
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:47,318
of plants rather than a couple

1385
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:50,119
selectable right so um I think every

1386
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:52,880
part of tissue culture is fascinating

1387
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:55,480
when you do it initially similarly

1388
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,039
seeing the roots in a clear media that

1389
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,119
you can just flip over and your plant

1390
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,480
doesn't fall down and you can see them

1391
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,358
growing out of the Spiral you can

1392
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,599
actually see the initial injury still

1393
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:07,598
and see it growing because it's not uh

1394
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:10,039
you know obstructed by a rock Cube or or

1395
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:13,280
some kind of plug I think that is in

1396
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:16,079
itself quite fascinating um and then I

1397
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:20,160
think at some point people are just like

1398
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:22,240
okay on to on to the next one right of

1399
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:24,798
course you know after you've seen it for

1400
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:27,358
a while yeah you know for me still

1401
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:30,038
seeing the plants multiply itself with

1402
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,480
no roots you know over the course I mean

1403
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:32,960
just seeing a plant in a jar is

1404
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,760
incredible for sure you know it's like

1405
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,679
you have that like the movie The

1406
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,839
Biosphere or something where people were

1407
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:40,759
living in this jar and like you know

1408
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:42,838
particularly before I put the vent on

1409
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:46,160
the container it's like nothing goes in

1410
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:48,400
nothing goes out you know it it's just

1411
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:51,759
an incredible thing to experience and as

1412
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,680
you see it much more you so when we I

1413
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,440
just thought it was interesting that you

1414
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:57,440
said that the rooting is the hardest

1415
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:00,159
part only from I mean from a purely

1416
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:02,519
biological standpoint growing what you

1417
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:05,920
have already is pretty easy you just got

1418
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:10,798
to keep on eating growing something new

1419
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:13,119
is incredibly hard so um and and then I

1420
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:15,119
just meant I like to relay it because

1421
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:18,119
we've all Clon so we've seen our plant

1422
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:20,160
just sit still for 10 11 days until it

1423
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,240
roots and then once it Roots it does

1424
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:25,358
what the plant did before I cut it and

1425
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:28,919
after it Roots it just Grows Right so I

1426
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:30,318
only want to that uh relay that I think

1427
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,960
you're totally right when we go to

1428
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:35,199
conventions when we go to shows we bring

1429
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,720
very pretty rooted plants in the

1430
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:38,679
containers because when we move them out

1431
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:41,038
of the container everybody knows what a

1432
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:43,679
plant in veg looks like they have them

1433
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:46,119
but in the container no if we're going

1434
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,679
to a show or let's say a convention and

1435
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:50,119
someone else is selling genetics over

1436
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,759
there it's very easy to be like well if

1437
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:53,838
let's say their genetics are clean but

1438
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,480
someone else walked in with potentially

1439
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:57,558
russet knes on their boot or whatever

1440
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,559
you know they can have access to those

1441
01:02:57,559 --> 01:03:02,000
plants at least our plants are in

1442
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:05,599
completely enclosed vessel so that

1443
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,000
provides a level of peace of mind that

1444
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,880
is hard to find elsewhere and people are

1445
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,199
incredibly fascinated by it way more

1446
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,200
than the science they just like the

1447
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:16,318
plant in the container and that's that's

1448
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:18,318
totally okay too not everyone has to

1449
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:20,519
know how something works to appreciate

1450
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:23,519
it but yeah I mean that's what you said

1451
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:25,480
is people don't know how it works um but

1452
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:27,639
you know like when you're in school you

1453
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:30,079
learn learn that the plants uptake

1454
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:32,000
nutrient from the roots and they you

1455
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,920
know they bring that up and then the

1456
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,159
plant photosynthesizes and creates more

1457
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,798
foliage and choots and you know maybe

1458
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:40,519
fruit so it's just taking that step out

1459
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,798
of the equation that leaves people going

1460
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:44,559
hey I learned that this is the way

1461
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:48,480
plants grow that that they need the

1462
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,160
roots yeah I think what happens is this

1463
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,119
is very common I remember like in an

1464
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:54,480
early

1465
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:57,640
class we often hear stuff and we fill in

1466
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,119
the gaps right like I remember being in

1467
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:02,798
an early physics class a little bit off

1468
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,400
the be path and there was like okay two

1469
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:07,119
cars hit into each

1470
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,400
other what do you expect to happen it's

1471
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,599
like what you expect to happen is they

1472
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,798
both bounce back right it's like that's

1473
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:14,359
exactly what happens now a heavier car

1474
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,599
and they both bounce into each other the

1475
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:18,000
heavier car you expect to not go flying

1476
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:20,920
backwards and the lighter car to go

1477
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,440
flying backwards right but explain why

1478
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:25,880
explain why and it's incredibly hard if

1479
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,000
you can't explain the concept of inertia

1480
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:31,240
but you fill in the Gap right you fill

1481
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,480
in the Gap and then it's like well what

1482
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:35,558
happens when I run into a wall really

1483
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,639
really fast I bounce backwards because I

1484
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:39,039
have less inertia than the wall but

1485
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:41,199
people don't think about it this way

1486
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,480
they just they fill in the gaps I think

1487
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:44,798
the same happens with like tissue

1488
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,559
culture or anything else this is why I

1489
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:49,960
often try to in my classes relate it to

1490
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:51,480
Conventional or traditional propagation

1491
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,760
because it's something that we're much

1492
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:56,719
more familiar with and Fascination is

1493
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:59,200
good but it's science we should be

1494
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:01,639
demystifying it and helping people

1495
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:04,439
understand it so that way like you if

1496
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:07,519
you want to pursue it the more

1497
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,960
demystified it is the easier it'll be

1498
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:11,480
like imagine how hard it would have been

1499
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,199
to even do it on your own if Bill had

1500
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,159
never come by and offer that initial

1501
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:18,558
assistance right uh never would have

1502
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:21,440
happened and it's probably maybe because

1503
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:24,720
it seemed Fantastical and very mystical

1504
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:27,960
it was intimidating exactly exactly so I

1505
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,399
I very much relate um or or empathetic

1506
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,159
to people like that it's why we thought

1507
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:34,720
the classes would be uh as popular as

1508
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,838
they ended up being um because people do

1509
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,480
really want to know and even if they

1510
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:40,318
don't do it they at least want to

1511
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,000
understand what other people are doing

1512
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:45,400
to make the most deliberate decision for

1513
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,278
themselves one of the main reasons why I

1514
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,480
wanted to do it back in the day and

1515
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:53,719
still want to um continue my tissue

1516
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:57,519
culture journey is it's very hard to

1517
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:59,519
keep lots of genetics mhm you know I I

1518
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:01,239
mean honestly if you just have one it

1519
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:04,079
can be hard to keep that as well we've

1520
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:07,679
seen many people you know including me

1521
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:11,079
lose valuable genetics and so when Bill

1522
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,639
showed me and I just love the man you

1523
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:16,480
know whe whether his kid is perfect or

1524
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:18,358
not I just love the man so um cuz he

1525
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,039
inspired me in in a lot of ways not just

1526
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:24,000
that but what he showed me was hey look

1527
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:26,039
in one flat you can have 30 jobs and

1528
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,838
even if you have redundancy let's say

1529
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:33,559
you have five jars of you know one

1530
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:34,440
genetic okay you can have six genetics

1531
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:37,400
in a

1532
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:41,278
flat okay and then you look at how many

1533
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:44,278
flats can you have in you know this 2x4

1534
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:50,480
10 that I had with with four rows on it

1535
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:54,119
it's like this isn't a way for me to

1536
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:56,519
preserve so many different genetics you

1537
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:59,039
know well like I think what the grateful

1538
01:06:56,519 --> 01:07:00,519
Head is doing is really great as far as

1539
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:05,880
they're holding these genetics and

1540
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:08,199
providing it to people but and this is

1541
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,798
nothing um negative to say about the

1542
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:10,838
Grateful head but like there have been

1543
01:07:09,798 --> 01:07:14,159
other

1544
01:07:10,838 --> 01:07:17,000
companies that you know people have paid

1545
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:20,038
to store their genetics and they went

1546
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,159
out of business you know and so like

1547
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:25,520
being able to do this stuff yourself to

1548
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:27,920
me is attractive because again you're

1549
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,519
you're in charge of your own destiny um

1550
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,798
you know something that we talked about

1551
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:33,719
you know on many other shows is like

1552
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:35,759
sharing genetics and you know part of

1553
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:37,639
the chem dog story is you know how it

1554
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,119
was shared and if it wasn't shared

1555
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:42,519
wouldn't be here so I mean using another

1556
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,440
place

1557
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:47,318
to you know do tissue culture as well

1558
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:50,278
and giving cuting to your friends and

1559
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:53,000
people that you know I think has value

1560
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:57,278
but you know one thing I want people to

1561
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:01,199
leave or I'd like people to leave this

1562
01:07:57,278 --> 01:08:04,318
um show with is an

1563
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:07,679
inspiration to you know learn about

1564
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:09,558
tissue culture and see you know because

1565
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:11,639
even though I didn't follow

1566
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:13,359
through you know for one reason or

1567
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:15,239
another you know things happened and you

1568
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:16,960
know I wasn't able to complete my tissue

1569
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:20,358
culture Journey I'm going to continue It

1570
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:23,439
Forward the benefits of of Growers using

1571
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:26,159
this technology even if it's just nodal

1572
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:29,198
you know for instance if you don't have

1573
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:32,079
um viruses if if you know this right

1574
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:34,079
let's say you purchased your clones from

1575
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:36,519
grateful Head and you know that they

1576
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:38,600
they don't have the virus then just

1577
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:41,560
keeping them and dividing them using

1578
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:44,920
noal tissue culture

1579
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,159
is a great way to go you know as far as

1580
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:50,000
like the amount of space that it's going

1581
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:53,639
to take so I want to encourage people to

1582
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,359
you know take a look at um you know not

1583
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:59,319
only bills class uh you know kits but um

1584
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:02,239
Phil has these classes now do you sell

1585
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:05,359
kits as well or do you just do classes

1586
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:08,439
we we just do classes because the the

1587
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:11,920
ingredients are available yeah yeah I

1588
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:13,719
mean yes I think like um basically what

1589
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,399
Bill taught you more than tissue culture

1590
01:09:13,719 --> 01:09:17,960
is that it's technique over everything

1591
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:20,238
right you didn't need a a huge setup and

1592
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,319
our first lab when we started was in a

1593
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:24,639
basement of a New England Mill probably

1594
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,880
one of the dirtiest places in this world

1595
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,319
and like it didn't matter because we

1596
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,400
didn't have to be sterile everywhere we

1597
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,520
had to be sterile in specific moments in

1598
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:35,679
in out of the auto playay in the Lamor

1599
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,159
Flo everywhere else it's all capped

1600
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,199
right so the same reason I can bring it

1601
01:09:37,158 --> 01:09:43,639
to a show is why I can do it here or

1602
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:47,599
there um I want to like yeah I want to

1603
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:50,520
just like adjust it in a pretty simple

1604
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,798
way the more self-sufficient you are

1605
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,159
across the board it's not a tissue

1606
01:09:51,798 --> 01:09:55,039
culture specific thing the more

1607
01:09:53,158 --> 01:09:57,399
self-sufficient you are across the board

1608
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:59,439
the better if you have land it's good to

1609
01:09:57,399 --> 01:10:03,719
learn how to grow agricultural crops

1610
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:05,639
food crops even more than NE necessarily

1611
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:07,239
uh something like cannabis something

1612
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,719
like you know you should learn how to

1613
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:10,439
grow food you should learn how to do

1614
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,719
basic maintenance on your car basic

1615
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:14,799
maintenance around the house like all of

1616
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,239
this is better than calling in a

1617
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,079
handyman and it also makes it more

1618
01:10:17,238 --> 01:10:20,799
applicable that you'll know when it is

1619
01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:22,840
appropriate to call in a handy man

1620
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,440
versus like switching out a fuse

1621
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:27,159
yourself versus necessarily needing to

1622
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:30,039
wire something because it's a deeper

1623
01:10:27,158 --> 01:10:31,960
issue than that right so knowing

1624
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:34,198
knowledge is never the wrong way it's

1625
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,439
always good to be as self-sufficient as

1626
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:39,599
you can be I think it's ultimately comes

1627
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:42,279
down to convenience and price right like

1628
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,560
there's a reason why an oil change is

1629
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:45,198
one of the easiest things you can do on

1630
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,080
your car and it's one of the least

1631
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:49,719
common performed tasks that people do

1632
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:52,960
because it costs $30 $40 for someone to

1633
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:54,399
do it and you'd rather many people would

1634
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,239
rather the Peace of Mind of having a

1635
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:58,439
professional do the oil change and if

1636
01:10:56,238 --> 01:10:59,839
they mess up whatever issue you know

1637
01:10:58,439 --> 01:11:02,359
whatever liability that comes is on

1638
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:05,199
their hands rather than if I mess up an

1639
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:07,319
oil change and now my driveway has a

1640
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:09,799
beautiful rainbow Sheen for the next six

1641
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:12,000
months as the oil just kind of stin

1642
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:15,039
there I have to deal with it right this

1643
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,920
is always like if the company goes out

1644
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:21,000
of business and they lose the strain

1645
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:25,359
there honestly might be like Pathways

1646
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:29,479
that people can take to at least get

1647
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:31,880
some level of

1648
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:34,158
uh I'm losing a word but like to get

1649
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,279
some value back right there may be like

1650
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:37,839
legal Pathways and St like that if you

1651
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:40,479
lose your strain in your tissue culture

1652
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:45,480
lab then it's like that's it it's gone

1653
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:47,479
um so the best place is like to do it in

1654
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:49,079
tandem ideally right I mean it doesn't

1655
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:50,479
have to be some paid facility if you and

1656
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:53,000
your friend both learn how to do tissue

1657
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:55,039
culture backing up each other's plants

1658
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,920
offsite of each other is always going to

1659
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:58,800
be the the safest way to ensure it it's

1660
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,158
like you're saying it's the reason chmd

1661
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,960
survived was because everyone had the

1662
01:12:01,158 --> 01:12:07,319
ability to keep it going and its

1663
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,760
Providence was never questioned so we

1664
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:12,000
all know what it is and everyone wants

1665
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:15,480
it it's great right

1666
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,560
um I I highly recommend like I wouldn't

1667
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:19,279
be able to do tissue culture if I didn't

1668
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,159
learn how to do tissue culture none of

1669
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:23,238
us would be able to grow cannabis if we

1670
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:24,719
didn't learn how to grow cannabis even

1671
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,879
if our parents were the greatest

1672
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,439
cannabis Growers ever we would still

1673
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,520
have to learn for us to be able to do it

1674
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,678
tissue culture and much to maybe your

1675
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,679
lived experience um it's not rocket

1676
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:38,920
surgery it's it's not the hardest thing

1677
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:40,639
in the world meem can be very tough you

1678
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,880
need a little bit of a microscope and

1679
01:12:40,639 --> 01:12:45,039
working under magnification can be tough

1680
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,639
because your own movements are magnified

1681
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:50,079
so your movement to the left is 30 times

1682
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:52,600
more to the left now under under a

1683
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:54,679
microscope but otherwise it's just

1684
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:58,400
muscle memory that's what growing is

1685
01:12:54,679 --> 01:13:01,920
that's what we all have so I highly

1686
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:05,759
encourage anyone who has any interest to

1687
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,960
learn it um no's very beginner friendly

1688
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,800
especially if you have any experience

1689
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,279
with cannabis cultivation it's very

1690
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,719
similar to cloning just on a much

1691
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:13,719
smaller

1692
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:22,039
scale and um something else that always

1693
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:23,399
concerns me about tissue culture that I

1694
01:13:22,039 --> 01:13:27,039
think it was part of the reason why I

1695
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:29,638
never made the full-on jump to it was I

1696
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:32,319
was scared that okay I can have these

1697
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:35,600
genetics and tissue culture but because

1698
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:38,279
it was still foreign to me I felt like I

1699
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,800
still had to keep the moms you know like

1700
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:42,439
I I I was scared like man you know like

1701
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,199
these things they could get contaminated

1702
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:46,000
or they could die and then I lose the

1703
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:49,399
genetics but I know that if I keep these

1704
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,359
mother plants I know how to do it yeah

1705
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:57,519
this I mean the golden rule for data

1706
01:13:52,359 --> 01:14:00,439
backup is 321 three copies two different

1707
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:03,960
Medias one offsite right right so three

1708
01:14:00,439 --> 01:14:05,638
copies can be you your buddy one of

1709
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,840
yours is in tissue culture one of them

1710
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:10,199
is a mom right it's an analog backup and

1711
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,880
and a digital backup for like and then

1712
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:14,879
your buddy is the third copy and he's

1713
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,319
offsite so if anything happens in your

1714
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,920
facility you can always get the genetics

1715
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:19,920
back I mean you know how to do the it's

1716
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:23,239
hard to do that like when particularly

1717
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:26,119
like when you get more and more genetics

1718
01:14:23,238 --> 01:14:27,919
yeah I mean space is all ultimately the

1719
01:14:26,119 --> 01:14:31,000
name of the game right I mean I think

1720
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,840
that's where for many cultivators you

1721
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,639
clean up your plants only once if you're

1722
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:37,119
Sops are good you don't necessarily need

1723
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:39,159
to be doing Maris stem cycle after after

1724
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:41,039
cycle you should just have a clean mom

1725
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:43,638
and then now you have a clean mom stop

1726
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,960
getting it dirty so for many cultivators

1727
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:48,279
it's it's exactly what you're describing

1728
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:51,079
it is a space thing they have

1729
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:54,000
sentimental or non-commercially viable

1730
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:57,639
but still valuable plants and they need

1731
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,439
some way of storing it um I mean I still

1732
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:02,679
recommend keeping a all around Universal

1733
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:04,279
like you that takes away one of the big

1734
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:06,119
advantages of tissue like that I

1735
01:15:04,279 --> 01:15:08,759
mentioned of tissue culture is that

1736
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:11,760
you're able to you know keep so many

1737
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:14,119
genetics in a small space well if I have

1738
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,000
to do that and then still have another

1739
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:17,920
space to keep the moms then that that

1740
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,719
whole Advantage was I would change it

1741
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:23,440
right because right now let's say you've

1742
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:25,760
got three strings right so you've got

1743
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:28,319
multiple moms per string

1744
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,239
usually at least on maybe a little bit

1745
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:32,519
smaller keeping the lineage going and

1746
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:34,559
one is being cannibalized for the round

1747
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,239
of cuttings or propagates that are being

1748
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,719
made right in tissue culture scenario

1749
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:42,519
you would keep a single mom alive

1750
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:45,399
literally just to be the backup Nole

1751
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:47,600
donor if it comes down and ideally that

1752
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:49,119
mom came from a Marist stem plant so you

1753
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,280
know it's clean and you never cut it so

1754
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:51,960
it's never going to be introduced to

1755
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:54,158
anything nothing's ever getting in there

1756
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,480
it's just in a corner somewhere growing

1757
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:58,638
never needed maybe once every other

1758
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:01,000
month it gets cloned down or or a fresh

1759
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:03,039
one out of TC comes out to replace it

1760
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,479
right but in tissue culture you are

1761
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:07,639
multiplying so you are making more

1762
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:09,319
copies that's your cloning step and

1763
01:16:07,639 --> 01:16:11,159
you're rooting so you're producing

1764
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:14,840
clones like you are basically replacing

1765
01:16:11,158 --> 01:16:16,559
the entire mom stage in tissue culture

1766
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,600
you would you would just keep a single

1767
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,000
mom as an analog backup so yeah it's a

1768
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,760
little bit Le I mean it's a little bit

1769
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,399
of a larger footprint for strain I think

1770
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:28,320
it's still considerably smaller than uh

1771
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:31,279
what many facilities are running now

1772
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:34,439
like five moms per strain so that they

1773
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:36,759
can meet their threshold run um how many

1774
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:38,839
clones they need yeah exactly exactly

1775
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,480
right right so throughput in tissue

1776
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:43,960
culture is very very easy it's it's the

1777
01:16:41,479 --> 01:16:46,279
main thing you see it being used for in

1778
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:49,359
Industry outside of Canabis like

1779
01:16:46,279 --> 01:16:52,399
commercial agricultural tissue culture

1780
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:55,439
is purely for production so like

1781
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:58,079
seedless watermelon they're great love

1782
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:00,039
them right seedless grapes whatever

1783
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:01,760
they're seedless you don't get a second

1784
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:03,319
generation from them they're not going

1785
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,119
to give you any seeds right so the

1786
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:08,479
easiest way to propagate them in the

1787
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:11,000
high density that's needed to Reed all

1788
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:13,479
the fields for the next generation is

1789
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,560
through tissue culture and sess

1790
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:18,559
watermelon all the plants that you can

1791
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,400
buy at your local hardware store if they

1792
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,679
sell them like moms or stuff like that

1793
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:26,439
yeah at a Home Depot or whatever all of

1794
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:28,279
those start from tisue culture and then

1795
01:17:26,439 --> 01:17:31,919
eventually make their way out right so

1796
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:33,479
for propagation cultivation scale it's

1797
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,840
an ex it's

1798
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:39,079
an Immaculate tool for like this large

1799
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:42,279
scale uh

1800
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:43,800
cultivation yeah for sure Sasha I know I

1801
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:46,679
interrupted you before when you were

1802
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,639
asking a questions so go ahead I have we

1803
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:50,359
both have so many questions for Phil

1804
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:53,119
yeah hopefully we can actually you know

1805
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:55,719
I have to tell you I have a facility of

1806
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:59,158
mother plants also here in Austria is

1807
01:17:55,719 --> 01:18:00,880
next to Slovenia where I live but uh

1808
01:17:59,158 --> 01:18:03,799
it's the same thing for me like I and

1809
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:06,840
Gabby when we met we started to talk and

1810
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:09,360
uh both of us have a lot of similarities

1811
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,679
and one of those is definitely the one

1812
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:13,639
that we are both uh dealing with the

1813
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:16,039
with the thoughts about starting a

1814
01:18:13,639 --> 01:18:18,400
tissue culture technique because we are

1815
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:19,920
getting older you know all of us in this

1816
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,638
industry you have to keep up the

1817
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,359
genetics for years and years you know

1818
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:26,359
and you are sometimes the only one that

1819
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:29,039
has a particular cut you're actually

1820
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:31,319
begging other other people to to keep it

1821
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:35,158
also but you know it's hard you know

1822
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:37,238
it's not yeah so something that is maybe

1823
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:39,879
only valuable to me right now maybe will

1824
01:18:37,238 --> 01:18:42,519
be valuable in 30 years to to many many

1825
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:45,000
more you know like like Gabby mentions

1826
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:47,840
the cam you know that's exactly this

1827
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,158
kind of story and the thing is that uh

1828
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,800
you realize when you work with plants a

1829
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:55,439
long time that this particular C that

1830
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:58,560
you work with every time so if you keep

1831
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:00,879
it like really in the perfect shape and

1832
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,600
the traditional cloning works right but

1833
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,880
the problem gets when you start to get

1834
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:07,600
this kind of you know when the cuts

1835
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,840
getting like 30 years old mhm like and

1836
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,760
then you can keep it up just for a

1837
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:16,119
certain amount of time and then you know

1838
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:19,840
cuz I was listening to skv podcast last

1839
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:21,880
time um he was on a podcast he told

1840
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,719
about his Endo fights right maybe it's

1841
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,880
not the virus The Hop virus but there

1842
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:29,119
there is this so much other stuff right

1843
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,440
yeah and uh I wanted to ask you before

1844
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:35,000
this question if I cut from a healthy

1845
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:37,759
mom let me say healthy not not top virus

1846
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,520
but it has all kind of other stuff right

1847
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:43,400
which I don't even know to name uh I

1848
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:46,639
make a merry stem from it a cut and I

1849
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:49,799
culture it and I I do then this uh noal

1850
01:19:46,639 --> 01:19:52,239
cuts from that yeah we will it be clean

1851
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:54,440
immediately or is there is a chance also

1852
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:55,399
that the virus is already in the tissue

1853
01:19:54,439 --> 01:19:56,439
right

1854
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:59,238
so like

1855
01:19:56,439 --> 01:20:01,678
the the reality is it's like how much

1856
01:19:59,238 --> 01:20:04,359
Nuance do we want to jump into because

1857
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:08,279
what does clean really mean right hops

1858
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:11,519
SL and vroid isn't new it's just we care

1859
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:13,519
about it now because all the other stuff

1860
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,560
that we already knew about we can handle

1861
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,639
right no one cares about hoplite and

1862
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:22,080
vroid when You' got rites because Russ

1863
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:24,800
mites kill your operation right now hops

1864
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:28,559
site and virid is a generational Pro

1865
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:31,000
long annoyance right how I have to

1866
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,880
disagree with you oh I mean but the

1867
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,039
thing is the reason why is because like

1868
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,560
russet mites may be super devastating to

1869
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:40,238
your plants right away but we do have

1870
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:42,360
some ideas on how to handle it like the

1871
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:45,079
average person can do it right that's

1872
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:48,039
what I'm saying man like we used to not

1873
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:51,279
know what to do with it right and so it

1874
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:52,840
kills your cycle immediately py milw

1875
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:55,158
kills your cycle immediately no one

1876
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:57,000
cares about how amazing your V was when

1877
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:58,759
you got powdery mildew and flour no one

1878
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,639
cares about how amazing your grow is

1879
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:03,960
when you got ptis faer but all of these

1880
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:06,119
because they're way more pertinent have

1881
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:08,000
solutions they needed Solutions we

1882
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:10,399
needed to figure out how to stop Russ at

1883
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,560
MES we needed to figure out how to stop

1884
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:14,799
howy Mill do because there would be no

1885
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,800
cannabis industry at all popsite and

1886
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:20,119
vroid is Progressive it's opportunistic

1887
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:22,760
the reason it can Thrive now is because

1888
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:25,639
we can handle everything else so now the

1889
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:28,600
next kid on the Block like bi ology is a

1890
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:30,920
game of finding energy resources and

1891
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,639
dominating them and plants are an

1892
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:35,158
incredible energy resource let's say we

1893
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:36,560
let's say we do Marist right this a

1894
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:39,359
classic question and I know I'm going to

1895
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:41,520
get uh into the weeds into it meristems

1896
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:43,359
aren't sterile they are infected by

1897
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,320
other things mitoviruses have been shown

1898
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:48,279
to infect cannabis meems have you ever

1899
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:51,039
heard of mitoviruses before this right

1900
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:54,079
no because who has who cares what does

1901
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:57,158
clean mean clean means I want my plant

1902
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:59,600
to produ prod right anything that stops

1903
01:21:57,158 --> 01:22:04,479
my plant from producing means it's not

1904
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:06,039
clean so HS vroid is now the newest

1905
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:07,839
version of the plant not being clean

1906
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:10,119
even though it's probably been around

1907
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,600
for thousands of years it's not named

1908
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:15,920
cannabis latent vroid and it's not

1909
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:18,159
called hops active vroid it's a latent

1910
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:21,239
vroid from a different species to jump

1911
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:24,079
species takes a lot of evolutionary time

1912
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:25,039
and to be latent it takes a lot of and

1913
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:27,719
then to be

1914
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:29,760
actually shown takes a lot of metabolic

1915
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:33,079
energy just like for humans showing

1916
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:35,560
herpes it's a latent virus it hides and

1917
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:37,439
only shows up when your immune system is

1918
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,159
complicated with some other illness

1919
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,799
right and then it goes away and then

1920
01:22:39,158 --> 01:22:44,679
like hops is exactly the same it shows

1921
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:46,639
up it's a it's a fantastic perspective

1922
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:48,800
that you have thank you for this because

1923
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:50,600
I was thinking the same and I'm not I

1924
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,239
was think I was thinking is I'm the only

1925
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:56,440
one that says hop latent is already been

1926
01:22:53,238 --> 01:22:58,479
there you know look at me and say no

1927
01:22:56,439 --> 01:23:01,039
it's not like that no let me Po it this

1928
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:03,718
way you have a garden that's got Hops

1929
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:05,679
and vroid and rites and there's no

1930
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:08,198
solution to either which one do you care

1931
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:10,319
more about

1932
01:23:08,198 --> 01:23:12,879
rites we don't care about it it's far

1933
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:14,880
more devastating far quicker for sure

1934
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,119
and and generationally if you don't get

1935
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,319
rid of them and you put more plants in

1936
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:22,000
the room they're right there again so it

1937
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:24,880
has the exact same threat of hops but

1938
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,840
like in the immediacy but we can deal

1939
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:31,000
with it we have MDES and sulfur sprays

1940
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:34,840
and all of these from holistic to

1941
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,639
pharmaceutical great Solutions and

1942
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:41,400
hops does not have that level of

1943
01:23:37,639 --> 01:23:43,639
solution yet or sophistication yet so so

1944
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:46,079
I mean literally Mar them is surgical

1945
01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:47,880
isolation this is like saying like you

1946
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:49,880
know we have a bloodb brain barrier many

1947
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:52,039
pathogens cannot cross it is the

1948
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,920
physical barrier to prevent things

1949
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:55,479
syphilis doesn't care it gets right into

1950
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,039
your brain and Rex havoc and in fact

1951
01:23:55,479 --> 01:24:00,119
because nothing else can co- uh infect

1952
01:23:58,039 --> 01:24:03,880
your brain or or struggles it has free

1953
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:06,439
rain and um so the marem is like we

1954
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:08,639
isolate the marem we isolate a lot of

1955
01:24:06,439 --> 01:24:10,879
stuff the Mito viruses nobody cares

1956
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:13,079
about but maybe in the future what every

1957
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,359
plant is from marem and we've

1958
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:18,359
essentially just hyper proliferated

1959
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:20,119
these viruses or viroids maybe they will

1960
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:22,279
cause issues but right now much like

1961
01:24:20,119 --> 01:24:24,599
hops andyroid when you have pattering

1962
01:24:22,279 --> 01:24:25,880
mil do you consider hops Android to

1963
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:30,239
basically

1964
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:33,039
asymptomatic um so I think uh like you

1965
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:35,919
know to go back to Sasha your initial

1966
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:38,158
question if you go from meristem and you

1967
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,639
successfully isolate that tissue you

1968
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:43,479
have successfully cleared up the

1969
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:46,960
systemic pathogens we currently care

1970
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:49,158
about but biology won't be static and in

1971
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:53,480
10 years from now there may be tomato

1972
01:24:49,158 --> 01:24:56,079
latent vroid or tobacco Mosaic vroid or

1973
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:58,479
like literally all you know and the more

1974
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:01,079
crops that are grown and the more land

1975
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:03,718
mass that is grown with it this type of

1976
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:06,719
cross speciation of pathogens you know

1977
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:08,880
is more likely a lot of mono monoculture

1978
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:12,118
also in the traditional sense where

1979
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:14,000
there is too much monoculture and this

1980
01:25:12,118 --> 01:25:15,880
yeah it's all monoculture these things

1981
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,679
progress in monoculture

1982
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:21,159
right with tissue culture like yeah this

1983
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:22,679
is why people wanted it because I mean

1984
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:24,519
you're talking about mon culture but I

1985
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:27,880
understand that you know in a lot of

1986
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:30,040
European uh sections it's mostly either

1987
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:32,560
hybridized Greenhouse or all outdoor

1988
01:25:30,039 --> 01:25:35,439
props right in the United States it's

1989
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:38,039
indoor so imagine indoor monoculture the

1990
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:40,039
minute any pathogen gets in there it's

1991
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:41,960
Wildfire because that pathogen has no

1992
01:25:40,039 --> 01:25:44,560
natural predators to prevent it like

1993
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:47,520
there are no natural Predators for Russ

1994
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:49,159
knites in my house there are Outdoors

1995
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,199
but when I grow the plant in my house

1996
01:25:49,158 --> 01:25:53,679
the rites get in they they are going to

1997
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:56,319
run wild and I mean uh same for

1998
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,960
everything too right so tissue culture

1999
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:00,359
is invaluable in that sense and if yeah

2000
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,439
if your pathogens that you're dealing

2001
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:04,880
with are

2002
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:08,118
nonsystemic Nole is is super good if

2003
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:10,279
your pathogens are systemic meristem is

2004
01:26:08,118 --> 01:26:12,399
the best we have right now because it

2005
01:26:10,279 --> 01:26:14,118
has a mosmatic barrier just like we have

2006
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:18,118
a blood brain barrier and that will

2007
01:26:14,118 --> 01:26:21,039
physically prevent certain microbes uh

2008
01:26:18,118 --> 01:26:24,679
and pathogens to get in there from like

2009
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:27,158
ferium to hopsa envir but you know to

2010
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:32,000
say it's clean so I guess in the end

2011
01:26:27,158 --> 01:26:35,638
it's um far better to start with marem

2012
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,760
anyway because you don't know the

2013
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:41,400
systemic issues that you have right

2014
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:43,280
every get intake we do through Mar Stu

2015
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:45,238
why risk it I mean you guys probably

2016
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:46,960
have a quarantine area because why risk

2017
01:26:45,238 --> 01:26:48,559
it already right this but even the

2018
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,239
quarantine area is only going to tell

2019
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,320
you about stuff that you can see that's

2020
01:26:51,238 --> 01:26:55,118
what I was like the marem is the

2021
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:57,238
quarantine area on stage steroids you're

2022
01:26:55,118 --> 01:27:00,158
not quarantining the plant you're

2023
01:26:57,238 --> 01:27:02,559
quarantining the section of the plant

2024
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:05,079
that won't have the microbes even if it

2025
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,560
didn't have it or even if it did have it

2026
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:08,319
and then because you know that you're

2027
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,920
quarantining that section what results

2028
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:14,439
from that section is totally kosher and

2029
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:16,760
and the resulting plant you can be less

2030
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:19,678
nervous of I mean you should certainly

2031
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:22,719
still test and and testing services are

2032
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:25,000
out there to help you but uh yeah that

2033
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:28,520
marem is the way to start if you run a

2034
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:33,279
tis but you know as far as testing it's

2035
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:35,280
kind of like um cannabid uh content we

2036
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:38,559
only test for certain things that we

2037
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:42,479
know about right so we may not be able

2038
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:44,920
to test for certain systemic issues that

2039
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:47,799
we don't know exist right like you're

2040
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:50,520
testing for ferium and stuff like that

2041
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,440
but yeah yeah what about like pium right

2042
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,320
like much to your point the reality is

2043
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:58,000
like

2044
01:27:54,319 --> 01:28:00,118
it's so it's even Bleaker the so oh my

2045
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,560
God it's bleer for many things that we

2046
01:28:00,118 --> 01:28:04,039
can test I mean the test is fine if

2047
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:06,480
you've got ferium it's a you know it's a

2048
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:08,960
fungi it's got DNA a DNA based test is

2049
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:10,879
very reliable anyone who goes onto a

2050
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,000
reality TV show to find out if they are

2051
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:15,239
or aren't the dad doesn't start arguing

2052
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,238
with a genetics test because DNA is

2053
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:21,479
pretty concrete evidence of an organism

2054
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:23,678
right um it's just like like for example

2055
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:24,638
the hopsa and V testing is a lot

2056
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:27,279
trickier

2057
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,159
but people demand it so everyone feels

2058
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:31,399
like they have to but it's almost like

2059
01:28:29,158 --> 01:28:33,839
uh security at the airport it's security

2060
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:35,559
theater rather than actual security

2061
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,239
they're not necessarily probably at the

2062
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:40,119
airport it works even better still I I

2063
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:44,279
would I would argue like you could make

2064
01:28:40,118 --> 01:28:47,439
that argument um that like a lot of the

2065
01:28:44,279 --> 01:28:49,559
testing that's offered is really just to

2066
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:51,799
Plate the minds of the people who are

2067
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:54,920
doing it rather than to get a genuine

2068
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:56,440
test um and then

2069
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:58,239
getting a genuine test is much harder

2070
01:28:56,439 --> 01:29:00,118
said than them too you know for some

2071
01:28:58,238 --> 01:29:01,839
things again for foran for paty M for

2072
01:29:00,118 --> 01:29:04,158
usit it's very very easy to get a

2073
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:06,000
reputable test and not worry about it

2074
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:09,359
but some other things that people care

2075
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,679
about are a little bit harder and so

2076
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:14,198
just to take a a quick flashback in time

2077
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:17,480
for me when I used to own the garden

2078
01:29:14,198 --> 01:29:19,719
spout and people would come in with you

2079
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:21,519
know some type of plant problem it was

2080
01:29:19,719 --> 01:29:23,118
very common that they would say I mean

2081
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,840
so common it would happen multiple times

2082
01:29:23,118 --> 01:29:28,039
a day people would say I think I have

2083
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:30,239
tobacco mosaic virus sure and we just

2084
01:29:28,039 --> 01:29:31,359
felt and you know the reason why I'm

2085
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:33,599
saying this is because I wanted to ask

2086
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:35,359
you what you think but we just felt

2087
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,800
anytime there was a problem that they

2088
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:40,238
didn't know what it was they were saying

2089
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,239
it's tobacco mosaic virus and now I

2090
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:44,198
think people are doing the same thing

2091
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:46,079
with hop Leon you if they're not doing

2092
01:29:44,198 --> 01:29:50,399
the testing they're like oh this plant

2093
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:52,479
is you know Gabby as an as an amazing uh

2094
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:55,000
juder character I think you accidentally

2095
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:57,799
stumbling into something closer to to a

2096
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,960
human condition like you are growing a

2097
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:02,119
plant your plant is growing suboptimum

2098
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:04,480
there are two realities either the

2099
01:30:02,118 --> 01:30:06,839
environment and exterior outside world

2100
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:08,759
is messing your plant or you are messing

2101
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:11,079
up your plant right and it's much easier

2102
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:13,560
for people who have egos and who have

2103
01:30:11,079 --> 01:30:16,319
like defensive mechanisms to blame

2104
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,840
anything other than themselves I just

2105
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,840
think it's that simple like my plant is

2106
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,279
messed up it's never been messed up

2107
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:25,239
before it must be the nutrients that

2108
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:27,399
have never been messed up up it must be

2109
01:30:25,238 --> 01:30:32,638
the soil that's never been messed up it

2110
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:35,599
must be the um vroid or whatever I mean

2111
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:38,639
most illnesses

2112
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:41,159
have uh obvious characteristics right

2113
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:43,719
like there are generalized immune

2114
01:30:41,158 --> 01:30:45,198
responses in Plants just like we have

2115
01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:48,679
generalized immune responses with

2116
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:50,238
getting a fever uh maybe feeling uneasy

2117
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:51,639
going to the bathroom like that no

2118
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:53,759
matter what gets us sick those are the

2119
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:56,440
first things our body wants us to do to

2120
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,560
get get a fever feel uneasy go to the

2121
01:30:56,439 --> 01:31:00,799
bathroom right plants do the same thing

2122
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:03,000
whether if they are overwatered they

2123
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,400
they Wilt if they're underwater they

2124
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,238
will they have generalized responses and

2125
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:10,000
when people see a generalized response I

2126
01:31:07,238 --> 01:31:14,000
think they just want to ascribe it to

2127
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,840
something other than my fault um the

2128
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,279
reality is probably like it wasn't

2129
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,960
tobacco mosaic virus its infection of

2130
01:31:18,279 --> 01:31:23,319
cannabis is relatively rare and if these

2131
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:26,239
are like indoor Growers going to a you

2132
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:29,399
know hydroponic shop then they probably

2133
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:32,079
are not interacting with tobacco

2134
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:34,559
frequently enough to be interact you

2135
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:36,439
know live tobacco not not like smokable

2136
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,719
tobacco but live tobacco that's got the

2137
01:31:36,439 --> 01:31:40,198
virus it's not just readily transmitting

2138
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:41,960
it and depending in what part of the

2139
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:43,919
country you're in it might not even be

2140
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:45,880
hospitable to grow tobacco in that part

2141
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,319
of the country so there might not be any

2142
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:51,118
tobacco for hundreds of miles you know

2143
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:54,158
from Connecticut the only tobacco they

2144
01:31:51,118 --> 01:31:56,238
grow is in green houses because they can

2145
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:58,359
make the leaves very very big perfect

2146
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:00,559
for Rolling but they don't grow any

2147
01:31:58,359 --> 01:32:02,359
smokable tobacco in Connecticut so if

2148
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:05,960
you had TMV

2149
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:08,679
here it would be you know quite I I

2150
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:10,560
guess I was you know because kind of

2151
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:13,239
like hop and viroid a lot of people

2152
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:18,159
blame their problems on hop and vroid

2153
01:32:13,238 --> 01:32:21,158
hop and vroid does exist right and um I

2154
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:24,399
thought tobacco mosaic virus did exist

2155
01:32:21,158 --> 01:32:26,879
in cannabis and that's and that's why um

2156
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:29,960
this had been happening so just as an

2157
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:32,000
education for me in the world do you cuz

2158
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:35,000
you just said that it would spread via

2159
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,279
fresh tobacco so it can't be spread like

2160
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,600
if somebody's holding a cigarette that's

2161
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:42,279
not going to spread it yeah yeah I mean

2162
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,480
like CU I always tell people you smoke

2163
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:45,399
you got to I mean you got to clean your

2164
01:32:43,479 --> 01:32:49,238
hands you probably should anyway but I

2165
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:50,118
was for me it was a confirm uh like to

2166
01:32:49,238 --> 01:32:51,919
just

2167
01:32:50,118 --> 01:32:54,599
potentially make sure that we're not

2168
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:57,199
spreading any you know vir irus or

2169
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:58,480
disease yeah I think like there has been

2170
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:02,238
a lot

2171
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:04,479
of it it was for the public good to tell

2172
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:06,158
people about spreading germs and washing

2173
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:08,439
your hands because the public should

2174
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:10,638
wash their hands like that's just a good

2175
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:12,198
advice to give people right but I think

2176
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:15,639
there was a lot

2177
01:33:12,198 --> 01:33:17,960
of Miss or a lot of emphasis put about

2178
01:33:15,639 --> 01:33:19,319
how transmittable certain things are

2179
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,639
like I remember growing up and watching

2180
01:33:19,319 --> 01:33:22,158
this video where someone put like blue

2181
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,480
paint on their hand and then every door

2182
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:27,920
knob they touch and stuff like that it's

2183
01:33:23,479 --> 01:33:32,238
like yeah but like how hospitable to a

2184
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:34,199
microb is a a metal door knob like yeah

2185
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:35,959
they're on there but are they growing on

2186
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:38,000
there am I touching that doorknob two

2187
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:41,600
laters two hours later and that's now

2188
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,079
still a living asilis and it might and

2189
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,880
then you know that's a very compelling

2190
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:47,279
reason to wash our hands but something

2191
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:49,319
like you know

2192
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:51,759
viruses they're not but they can very

2193
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:54,479
simply be thought of as like

2194
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:58,119
uh God like um

2195
01:33:54,479 --> 01:34:00,959
parasites so they need other cellular

2196
01:33:58,118 --> 01:34:02,519
Machinery from a donor to work they

2197
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,439
can't just I mean they can survive in

2198
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,920
the environment but they can't

2199
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:07,439
necessarily live in the environment

2200
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:10,920
Drive in the environment for a very long

2201
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:14,799
time until applicable host gets

2202
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:17,840
them dead tobacco tissue that's been

2203
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:19,360
processed and probably been like infused

2204
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:22,679
with some glycerin and stuff to make it

2205
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:24,839
more smokable and and easier to that I

2206
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:26,880
would say that's you probably have a

2207
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:28,760
higher risk of like

2208
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,118
catching I don't want to go

2209
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:33,239
controversial you probably are very safe

2210
01:34:31,118 --> 01:34:36,158
you are very say if you if you have a

2211
01:34:33,238 --> 01:34:39,359
field next to a tobacco field and

2212
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:41,238
cannabis likes very similar

2213
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:43,679
environmental conditions that tobacco

2214
01:34:41,238 --> 01:34:45,638
likes so it's not like to say in certain

2215
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:47,199
countries where they could grow both

2216
01:34:45,639 --> 01:34:49,760
that they're growing both yeah you could

2217
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:53,479
definitely see TMV uh and it has some

2218
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:54,880
very unique variegation style morphology

2219
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:55,799
uh

2220
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,239
but that's what I'm saying like if

2221
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,039
you're just like a if you're a hom

2222
01:34:57,238 --> 01:35:02,678
grower in the Pacific Northwest it's

2223
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:04,840
probably very rare that you have um TMV

2224
01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:07,760
if you're a hom grower in the great

2225
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:10,719
north of uh Maine it's probably rare if

2226
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:13,960
you're in Georgia it's a more compelling

2227
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:16,198
argument makes sense yeah something else

2228
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:17,719
that I was really interested in and SL

2229
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:19,118
Sasha please interrupt me if you have

2230
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:20,560
any questions cuz I have so many

2231
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:25,319
questions I may not be giving you any

2232
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:29,920
time but um I saw on your website and

2233
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:33,719
I've heard on so I was actually I'm part

2234
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:36,600
of a tissue culture group on Facebook

2235
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:37,439
nice and it's all like regular plants

2236
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,800
not

2237
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:43,559
cannabis and um and I'm sure you know

2238
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:46,039
the company uh plant sell Technologies

2239
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:48,280
they sell um you know ingredients for

2240
01:35:46,039 --> 01:35:50,880
tissue culture MH

2241
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:55,079
um they were talking about synthetic

2242
01:35:50,880 --> 01:36:00,400
seeds and I saw synthetic seeds on

2243
01:35:55,079 --> 01:36:03,000
your um on your website so please tell

2244
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:04,439
people about synthetic seeds because I

2245
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,238
can't be the only one that doesn't know

2246
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:07,879
much about them okay it's very simple

2247
01:36:06,238 --> 01:36:10,839
think about it this

2248
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:13,560
way you we can make a gel right that's

2249
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:16,079
what the Agger is that we uh put in

2250
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:19,000
tissue coats right normally what we do

2251
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:20,559
is we make the gel it's a liquid we pour

2252
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,679
that gel into a container and when it

2253
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,920
cools it solidifies and then it becomes

2254
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:27,639
the gel that you can half and you this a

2255
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,319
solid right where synthetic Ceda says

2256
01:36:27,639 --> 01:36:31,719
it's like why don't we just put the

2257
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:34,118
plant in the middle of that gel and then

2258
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:38,679
we put the gel around it so it's not a

2259
01:36:34,118 --> 01:36:40,920
real seed it's not uh new tissue that's

2260
01:36:38,679 --> 01:36:43,279
made from two parents and the result of

2261
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:46,199
pollination it's not a seed you don't

2262
01:36:43,279 --> 01:36:47,880
germinate it like a seed you don't crack

2263
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:51,198
it like a seed all that good stuff it's

2264
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:54,279
a seed in that it's around it looks like

2265
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:56,839
a seed it's aesthetically pleasing

2266
01:36:54,279 --> 01:36:59,279
um most of the time in industry and in a

2267
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:00,960
lot of like academic lab they don't go

2268
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:04,399
for that aesthetic route they just

2269
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:07,039
encapsulate it literally they make the

2270
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:09,198
seed the capsule they put the node in

2271
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:10,880
the capsule whatever shape it is

2272
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:12,519
whatever shape it naturally made because

2273
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:15,118
it's a chemical reaction so when the two

2274
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:18,880
chemicals interact it immediately makes

2275
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:22,559
that hardening of the shell so um how it

2276
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:24,480
works is in traditional tissue culture

2277
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,159
you put all your nutrients and hormones

2278
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:28,718
into the Agger and then the Ager

2279
01:37:27,158 --> 01:37:32,519
solidifies as it

2280
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:35,279
cools in a synthetic seed you put all of

2281
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:38,239
your nutrients into the solution and the

2282
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:39,920
solution will naturally solidify when it

2283
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:41,598
comes into contact with a semach second

2284
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,239
chemical so it's a chemical reaction

2285
01:37:41,599 --> 01:37:45,079
it's not about cooling down it happens

2286
01:37:43,238 --> 01:37:46,678
at room temperature versus like tissue

2287
01:37:45,079 --> 01:37:50,198
culture when you pour the media has to

2288
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:52,639
still be warm um and yeah they call it a

2289
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:54,439
synthetic seed because the plant isn't

2290
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:56,840
really actively growing you can put it

2291
01:37:54,439 --> 01:38:00,598
in the fridge you can store it for a

2292
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:04,319
very long time it has some similarities

2293
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:05,719
in a functional way as a seed but like

2294
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:08,000
it's not going to have a tap rout it's

2295
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:10,840
not going to have any of that type of uh

2296
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,359
characteristics and it looks immaculate

2297
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:16,840
in pictures people love it very very

2298
01:38:13,359 --> 01:38:18,920
cool science fiction I mean is this

2299
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:21,400
something that for CU so for instance

2300
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:23,158
out here there's a lot of people that

2301
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:25,000
will grow seasonally and they take the

2302
01:38:23,158 --> 01:38:27,960
winter off like you people that are not

2303
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:31,800
growing indoors is this something that

2304
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:33,800
actually could be used for for them no

2305
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:36,079
no so like so from this you still have

2306
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:38,639
to do the tissue culture process is it

2307
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:41,760
more complicated than if you were to do

2308
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:43,960
tissue culture right out of the gate

2309
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,320
it's it's a it's literally noal I mean

2310
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,840
you you're encapsulating a node and then

2311
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:49,679
you're storing it and when you break

2312
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,360
that storage that dorcy you're just

2313
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,719
doing nodal um what it really is for is

2314
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:57,039
like let's say I wanted to get some

2315
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:59,039
genetics to Sasha even shipping stuff in

2316
01:38:57,039 --> 01:39:01,519
tissue culture could be

2317
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:04,560
very uh temperamental to the temperature

2318
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:06,840
outside I mean because in tissue culture

2319
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:09,920
the nutrients and hormones are still

2320
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,279
promoting growth growth under stressful

2321
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:13,359
conditions like the below freezing

2322
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,319
temperatures that it currently is means

2323
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:18,479
that you'll get messed up morphology or

2324
01:39:15,319 --> 01:39:20,960
more commonly often death because uh

2325
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:22,638
synthetic seeds are about stasis I can

2326
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,760
ship them somewhere that will take a

2327
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:27,118
very long time they can get caught up in

2328
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:29,920
customs and then eventually make it to

2329
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:32,279
his doorstep and then if he you know can

2330
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,039
do nodal on them he can germinate them

2331
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:36,198
they'll have you know the longer they

2332
01:39:34,039 --> 01:39:38,039
stay the lower germination rate they'll

2333
01:39:36,198 --> 01:39:40,598
be just like traditional seeds so this

2334
01:39:38,039 --> 01:39:42,279
is a great way of transporting genetics

2335
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:45,279
to someone on the other end that can do

2336
01:39:42,279 --> 01:39:49,359
Nole yeah this is essentially how

2337
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:51,479
all tissue culture organisms I'm not

2338
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:54,238
even saying plants this is basically how

2339
01:39:51,479 --> 01:39:56,598
they're all sent they're sent in

2340
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:58,238
culture if they can survive in a Petri

2341
01:39:56,599 --> 01:40:00,599
dish they'll survive in a Petri dish but

2342
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:02,638
if they can't they'll usually be sent in

2343
01:40:00,599 --> 01:40:04,159
some kind of suspension the plant

2344
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,719
version of that suspension is a

2345
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:10,559
synthetic

2346
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:13,520
seed wow it's super cool yeah everything

2347
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:15,880
you're doing is super cool um something

2348
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:18,960
that I mentioned earlier before and

2349
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:22,359
wanted to make sure to get back to

2350
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:24,480
was um well first of all let me tell a

2351
01:40:22,359 --> 01:40:27,719
story that someone else tells oh yeah

2352
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:31,319
and this is um NATO dog he tells a story

2353
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:33,279
about how he bought a bunch of plants

2354
01:40:31,319 --> 01:40:36,238
that were tissue culture

2355
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:39,039
plants and that you know it was

2356
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:41,919
thousands of plants at a giant farm in

2357
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:44,158
the Palm Desert or somewhere down in you

2358
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:47,880
know Southern California and he said

2359
01:40:44,158 --> 01:40:51,799
that he had a massive incidence of

2360
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:54,000
heroism and he felt that it was because

2361
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:58,440
of the hormones

2362
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:01,279
that are used in tissue culture and my

2363
01:40:58,439 --> 01:41:03,439
buddy Cosmic not because of that but

2364
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:06,599
just because of lack of knowing how to

2365
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:09,479
you know mix the hormones or you know

2366
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:12,639
the fear of it he just does noal t uh

2367
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:17,000
tissue culture with the MS is that what

2368
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:20,118
it's called MH MH and it works now the

2369
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:23,000
disadvantage that I see is that the

2370
01:41:20,118 --> 01:41:23,759
plants root and they kind of grow like a

2371
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,319
reg

2372
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:30,119
plant in there whereas when you use the

2373
01:41:27,319 --> 01:41:31,079
growth hormone for instance you get a

2374
01:41:30,118 --> 01:41:34,079
lot of

2375
01:41:31,079 --> 01:41:38,158
multiplication so you get more

2376
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:40,399
shoots but you know I I'm trying to

2377
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:43,920
learn and when I'm thinking about like

2378
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:46,879
what he's doing I say well maybe this is

2379
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:49,599
less likely to cause a

2380
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:52,039
problem um because he's not using these

2381
01:41:49,599 --> 01:41:53,880
hormones even if he doesn't have the

2382
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:57,800
advantage of

2383
01:41:53,880 --> 01:42:00,719
of of being able to get it to multiply

2384
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:02,960
as fast yeah so you know what do you

2385
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:05,319
think you're coming from so uh this is

2386
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,520
honestly more a broad question about

2387
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:10,158
hormones their use their function how do

2388
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,800
we how do we navigate it right because

2389
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:14,079
we don't really you know we're not

2390
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:16,039
plants we don't use Iva so how much is

2391
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:17,279
the right amount of Iva versus how much

2392
01:42:16,039 --> 01:42:20,238
is going to get

2393
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:22,399
you adverse effects right the thing

2394
01:42:20,238 --> 01:42:25,879
we're always trying to not get any side

2395
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:28,799
effects adverse stuff that right

2396
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:31,319
so when we started Massachusetts

2397
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:34,199
Massachusetts similar to Connecticut non

2398
01:42:31,319 --> 01:42:36,479
agricultural State um that aformentioned

2399
01:42:34,198 --> 01:42:39,238
plant maybe I talked about like an hour

2400
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:41,638
and a half ago aronia is grown primarily

2401
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:44,799
in Massachusetts I it's a tree I never

2402
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:48,800
heard of it it makes juice that makes

2403
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:50,440
cranberries taste sweet so uh very un I

2404
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,480
have it here at home it's growing

2405
01:42:50,439 --> 01:42:53,919
outside of my house it's a beautiful

2406
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:56,638
tree

2407
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:59,039
in terms of like you know uh is they

2408
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:00,599
sell pills of it yeah yeah it's very

2409
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:02,800
healthy for stuff like that yeah yeah

2410
01:43:00,599 --> 01:43:06,920
like I tried it like it was like a

2411
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:09,639
novelty thing where you know you eat it

2412
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:11,359
and then you try other foods and they

2413
01:43:09,639 --> 01:43:14,039
taste completely different and sour

2414
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:16,319
stuff will tast taste sweet did it work

2415
01:43:14,039 --> 01:43:18,719
it worked that's great it was I think

2416
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:20,279
it's called like Miracle something so I

2417
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:22,319
know a lot of people like that because

2418
01:43:20,279 --> 01:43:24,880
it's a red fruit so it's very high in

2419
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:27,198
antioxidants and if you're someone who

2420
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:30,480
like really believes in oxidative stress

2421
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:33,799
then it makes a lot of uh sense to to

2422
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:36,158
like it but it's not very common um so

2423
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:38,400
yeah Massachusetts did not have a strong

2424
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:40,559
agricultural program um so when they

2425
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:43,319
legalize Canabis in 2016 what they did

2426
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:47,000
was they copied the USDA rules for

2427
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:48,719
organic Horticulture blindly one to one

2428
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,599
they didn't revise anything they just

2429
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:53,840
copy pasted it this is now their hemp

2430
01:43:50,599 --> 01:43:56,639
program guidelines right so the USDA

2431
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:58,760
Organics guidelines say you can do a lot

2432
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,319
of stuff you can use salt fertilizers

2433
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:01,679
you can grow in rockol you can gr do

2434
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:04,039
whatever right the only thing you can't

2435
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:05,599
do is use synthetic pesticides it's the

2436
01:44:04,039 --> 01:44:09,439
only thing that will make an organic

2437
01:44:05,599 --> 01:44:12,560
grow not organic synthetic okay one of

2438
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:15,319
my favorite things to talk about is that

2439
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:19,280
IBA is often

2440
01:44:15,319 --> 01:44:23,198
synthetic and oxin in high doses are

2441
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:24,399
herbicidal so it's in it is by the USDA

2442
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,000
definition and in the state of

2443
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:28,879
Massachusetts ibaa is a synthetic

2444
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,198
pesticide you cannot use you can't use

2445
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,359
it in tisue culture you can't use it at

2446
01:44:30,198 --> 01:44:34,399
all they don't clone with clone X they

2447
01:44:32,359 --> 01:44:36,439
don't clone with formin they don't well

2448
01:44:34,399 --> 01:44:38,399
maybe they do and it's just hidden right

2449
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:42,079
no they don't because let me tell you

2450
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:44,319
you can test for it when when uh when

2451
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:46,880
they were doing an audit in like 2018 or

2452
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:50,000
something like that they found it in a

2453
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:52,159
facility like a $4 million already

2454
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,800
licensed facility they pulled their

2455
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:56,079
license they didn't susp spend it they

2456
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,840
didn't they revoked it after they had

2457
01:44:56,079 --> 01:45:01,079
gone like 3 four years that was so like

2458
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:03,639
it was one of those like they led by

2459
01:45:01,079 --> 01:45:05,158
example I think most other facilities

2460
01:45:03,639 --> 01:45:07,440
especially because Massachusetts has

2461
01:45:05,158 --> 01:45:09,118
essentially a 2 million entry like

2462
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:10,678
dollar for entry I don't think you're

2463
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:13,598
supposed to use it in California either

2464
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:17,039
and I think everyone uses it I think

2465
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:20,840
check it's all about how AG so some

2466
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:22,760
states they you know they legalize it

2467
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:25,000
accordingly they say you know if you use

2468
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:27,159
it as a plant growth regulator it's not

2469
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,158
a pesticide if you use it as a pesticide

2470
01:45:27,158 --> 01:45:31,679
it is a pesticide and they'll ban the

2471
01:45:29,158 --> 01:45:34,118
usage and some sometimes dosages but

2472
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:35,920
some states will just you know blindly

2473
01:45:34,118 --> 01:45:37,639
ban it that was the approach of

2474
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:39,599
Massachusetts which means when we

2475
01:45:37,639 --> 01:45:41,480
started Massachusetts because it was

2476
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:42,960
legal in Connecticut wasn't which is why

2477
01:45:41,479 --> 01:45:45,039
I moved there and started in

2478
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,679
Massachusetts we couldn't use hormones

2479
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:47,880
and we didn't use hormones and yeah

2480
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:50,800
guess what the plant doesn't need

2481
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:54,319
hormones you know the plant has all of

2482
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:57,719
the genetic code and resources and tools

2483
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:59,639
to build whatever it initially had that

2484
01:45:57,719 --> 01:46:02,359
we removed from it it just needs

2485
01:45:59,639 --> 01:46:05,440
building blocks nutrients literally just

2486
01:46:02,359 --> 01:46:06,960
NPK some micronutrients some vitamins

2487
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:09,399
and it'll do

2488
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:11,118
it hormones are where it gets

2489
01:46:09,399 --> 01:46:12,359
complicated and usually what I do in my

2490
01:46:11,118 --> 01:46:13,880
classes when I talk about this stuff is

2491
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:15,839
I stop talking about PLS I stop talking

2492
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:17,118
about people because it's way easier for

2493
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,880
us to understand the difference between

2494
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:23,920
nutrients and hormones right so all of

2495
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:27,239
us can eat roughly the same diet in

2496
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:30,599
terms of grams of car of carbs proteins

2497
01:46:27,238 --> 01:46:32,678
and fats and total calories we all eat

2498
01:46:30,599 --> 01:46:35,279
the roughly the same diet we'll all be

2499
01:46:32,679 --> 01:46:36,960
roughly healthy few people obviously by

2500
01:46:35,279 --> 01:46:40,000
percentage have metabolic disorders they

2501
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:42,198
need tailored diets but generally diet

2502
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,880
is very

2503
01:46:42,198 --> 01:46:48,678
generalized uh hormones are different I

2504
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:52,118
have a brother he that [ __ ] Who

2505
01:46:48,679 --> 01:46:53,399
is younger than me is taller um if we

2506
01:46:52,118 --> 01:46:56,000
when we were teenag

2507
01:46:53,399 --> 01:46:59,118
if we both took HGH to be the same

2508
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:02,359
height if we took the same amount I

2509
01:46:59,118 --> 01:47:05,039
might be taller and he might be too tall

2510
01:47:02,359 --> 01:47:07,598
still right we need a dose if if we took

2511
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:10,760
too low of amount he might be taller and

2512
01:47:07,599 --> 01:47:13,440
I might get cancer hormones are extreme

2513
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:17,239
signaling profile I mean think about

2514
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:19,118
guys who are now beyond that age uh of

2515
01:47:17,238 --> 01:47:22,158
pubescent and are now like in their 30s

2516
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:24,920
or 40s like you don't feel like you're

2517
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:27,598
22 any anymore but if you get a dose of

2518
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:31,599
testosterone testosterone patch or HRT

2519
01:47:27,599 --> 01:47:33,520
therapy um you will feel you'll have

2520
01:47:31,599 --> 01:47:35,960
energy your muscles will recover you

2521
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:37,639
will have the appetite your ha hair will

2522
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:40,198
start regrowing your voice will get

2523
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:42,760
deeper your memory will all of those

2524
01:47:40,198 --> 01:47:45,118
things are directed by your dose of

2525
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:46,800
testosterone and it's all those things

2526
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:48,639
Spike when you get a testosterone dose

2527
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:51,119
and as you get further away from that

2528
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:53,719
injection or patch you get back to your

2529
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:57,439
normal do like level of performance

2530
01:47:53,719 --> 01:47:59,840
right hormones are incredibly specific

2531
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:02,678
they need a lot of diet same with I mean

2532
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:05,560
like you can look all over uh Instagram

2533
01:48:02,679 --> 01:48:07,000
if you look at people who are um doing

2534
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:09,000
tissue culture and their formulations

2535
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,960
aren't right you'll get cancerous

2536
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,039
looking calluses that are three times

2537
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:15,800
four time eight times the size of the

2538
01:48:13,039 --> 01:48:18,158
plant that is clearly not directed

2539
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:20,480
growth of a regenerative plant that is

2540
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:23,479
Runaway growth which in biology is the

2541
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:26,479
literal definition of cancer is growth

2542
01:48:23,479 --> 01:48:28,559
that has bypass a checkpoint to stop and

2543
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:31,079
just keeps growing and as long as you

2544
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:32,719
give cancer food sugar which often if

2545
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:35,679
you guys you know you've made the media

2546
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:39,880
is in these nutrients they keep Dr

2547
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:42,440
so hormones can lead to all the

2548
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:45,960
difference in the world

2549
01:48:42,439 --> 01:48:48,799
right they can make plants look

2550
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:51,560
phenotypically different after tissue

2551
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,760
culture when you transplant them in fact

2552
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:57,199
we just posted some pictures uh Super

2553
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,440
Silver Haze the loo which is incredibly

2554
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:00,279
I hate using this term but I'm going to

2555
01:48:58,439 --> 01:49:02,399
use it because I know it's uh industry

2556
01:49:00,279 --> 01:49:04,079
standard incredibly sativa dominant I

2557
01:49:02,399 --> 01:49:07,279
mean it's it's not even hyz it's just

2558
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:09,639
straight up basically a sativa and or

2559
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:11,559
for phenotypic reasons a narrow leaf

2560
01:49:09,639 --> 01:49:14,239
plant right but if you look at the

2561
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:15,760
picture its leaves are much broader

2562
01:49:14,238 --> 01:49:17,799
because it just came out of tissue

2563
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:20,159
culture and the hormones I mean cyto

2564
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:22,039
Canin have incredible impacts on LEF

2565
01:49:20,158 --> 01:49:23,319
morphology and stuff like that in terms

2566
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:26,118
of keeping them

2567
01:49:23,319 --> 01:49:27,679
uh green for longer uh controlling

2568
01:49:26,118 --> 01:49:29,359
something that's called programmable

2569
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:31,039
time death which is what the leaves do

2570
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:33,000
when it's winter right they all fall off

2571
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:34,198
the trees it's not coincidental it's a

2572
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:38,399
mechanism called

2573
01:49:34,198 --> 01:49:40,118
inessence um cyto influence that so out

2574
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:42,679
of tissue culture the leaves of the

2575
01:49:40,118 --> 01:49:45,039
super silver haze are much broader than

2576
01:49:42,679 --> 01:49:47,480
you would expect I know in like a month

2577
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:49,158
or two as it gets farther and farther

2578
01:49:47,479 --> 01:49:51,718
away from its tissue culture and

2579
01:49:49,158 --> 01:49:53,839
hormonal experience it will return to

2580
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:56,319
its natural hor hormonal balance and its

2581
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:58,199
natural levels and the fan leaves will

2582
01:49:56,319 --> 01:49:59,799
th out and this is something that we see

2583
01:49:58,198 --> 01:50:03,198
across the board it's actually why we

2584
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:05,719
posted a good Jam iton six because it

2585
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:07,238
maintained extremely narrow leaves

2586
01:50:05,719 --> 01:50:09,158
throughout tissue culture which is

2587
01:50:07,238 --> 01:50:10,959
extremely rare it's probably the most

2588
01:50:09,158 --> 01:50:14,598
narrow leaves that we ever seen which

2589
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:17,000
means it might be the most truest sativa

2590
01:50:14,599 --> 01:50:18,599
we've ever worked with through TC

2591
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,599
because it's very hard to pretend like

2592
01:50:18,599 --> 01:50:24,560
hormones don't impact stuff right I mean

2593
01:50:20,599 --> 01:50:27,599
like obviously um

2594
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:30,080
so that is like

2595
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:31,480
undeniable to your buddies or to the

2596
01:50:30,079 --> 01:50:33,000
story that you were talking about right

2597
01:50:31,479 --> 01:50:35,158
inheriting these plants and then them

2598
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,679
from aiting out it really depends on

2599
01:50:35,158 --> 01:50:40,198
what hormones they use because hormones

2600
01:50:36,679 --> 01:50:45,039
have a shelf life for example clonex

2601
01:50:40,198 --> 01:50:48,719
comes in a dark bottle with

2602
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:51,000
99.7% of it is not Iva it's stabilizing

2603
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:52,198
ingredients because ibaa is very light

2604
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,679
sensitive which is why it comes in a

2605
01:50:52,198 --> 01:50:55,598
dark bottle and very temperature

2606
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:57,760
sensitive so you can't just willy-nilly

2607
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:59,639
have it in your grow room like you have

2608
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:01,199
a bottle of something else because it'll

2609
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:05,480
eventually degrade and now you've got a

2610
01:51:01,198 --> 01:51:06,960
bottle of very expensive water um so you

2611
01:51:05,479 --> 01:51:10,000
would expect that plants that leave

2612
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,840
tissue culture will 100% return to their

2613
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,800
true

2614
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:16,239
phenotype whenever those hormones get

2615
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:18,719
processed out some hormones especially

2616
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:21,598
synthetic hormones are way more stable

2617
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:25,359
and if they're used the phenotypic

2618
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:26,960
plasticity might last much longer than

2619
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:28,920
uh if other hormones were used and that

2620
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:31,000
might have been what he was experiencing

2621
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:35,359
so I mean and I don't want to call it a

2622
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:39,078
mistake but I guess what what you're

2623
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:41,000
saying happened was or saying is that

2624
01:51:39,078 --> 01:51:43,399
these plants are much better used as

2625
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
mother plants than straight stock to

2626
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:48,719
immediately put in the

2627
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,719
field I mean I have a very critical

2628
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:53,719
standpoint on hermaphrodism in in

2629
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:55,359
cannabis it's always the Grower's fa

2630
01:51:53,719 --> 01:51:57,639
it's just that simple always the

2631
01:51:55,359 --> 01:51:59,399
Grower's fault because it's not a

2632
01:51:57,639 --> 01:52:02,078
genetic trait it's an environmental

2633
01:51:59,399 --> 01:52:03,399
trait so I mean and that's not to say

2634
01:52:02,078 --> 01:52:05,960
like look if you're growing 100 strains

2635
01:52:03,399 --> 01:52:08,000
in one room it's impossible to have all

2636
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:09,399
100 strains have the optimized

2637
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,920
environment you're going to pick some

2638
01:52:09,399 --> 01:52:12,960
temperatures that some like some

2639
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:15,359
humidities that some don't and if you

2640
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:17,198
stress the wrong ones too far that's

2641
01:52:15,359 --> 01:52:19,479
what they'll do because that's what a

2642
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:21,879
dying plant that can become male does it

2643
01:52:19,479 --> 01:52:24,959
ches tries to save it tries to save its

2644
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:26,960
gene like DNA is selfish and it's way

2645
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:28,639
easier to propagate your DNA the whole

2646
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,599
point of living from a biological

2647
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:32,279
standpoint I'm saying as someone who has

2648
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:35,319
no kids and no interest in them so from

2649
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:40,118
a biological standpoint that is the game

2650
01:52:35,319 --> 01:52:42,439
plan yeah so what's your plan to survive

2651
01:52:40,118 --> 01:52:45,279
buddy just enjoy my life with the

2652
01:52:42,439 --> 01:52:47,960
wonderful people I have you know and and

2653
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:50,198
I have no many wonderful family members

2654
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:51,840
that have kids many wonderful uh friends

2655
01:52:50,198 --> 01:52:55,439
that have kids and I wish them all the

2656
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:57,119
best I think knowing what you should do

2657
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:59,919
and knowing what you shouldn't do is a

2658
01:52:57,118 --> 01:53:00,960
strength so I was I was just kidding I

2659
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:03,760
got

2660
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:05,880
you I also think I also think you you

2661
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,239
probably have a lot to offer I feel like

2662
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:08,639
you'd be a better parent than a lot of

2663
01:53:07,238 --> 01:53:11,158
the people out there that are parent

2664
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:13,279
hope to offer it to again my loved ones

2665
01:53:11,158 --> 01:53:16,839
and friends and to keep expanding on

2666
01:53:13,279 --> 01:53:19,319
those uh people um that's awesome but I

2667
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:21,360
hope SL uh Sasha and I are are part of

2668
01:53:19,319 --> 01:53:23,599
that expansion program of course it's

2669
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:25,799
happening in real time

2670
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:27,840
um it's like literally the best part of

2671
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,239
this podcast is the friends that we're

2672
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:32,239
making I forgot he didn't finish

2673
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:35,158
answering the question about using

2674
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:37,198
hormones or not using hormones you know

2675
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:40,118
because Cosmic does not Cosmic does not

2676
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:42,519
use the hormones getting them to grow

2677
01:53:40,118 --> 01:53:45,519
like you should use hormones the reality

2678
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:48,599
is like the plant will grow just like in

2679
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:50,760
Massachusetts if you clone in an a

2680
01:53:48,599 --> 01:53:52,440
cloner and you just put water in there

2681
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:54,880
that's phed correctly and you just

2682
01:53:52,439 --> 01:53:57,519
sprits it onto the base eventually it'll

2683
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:59,880
callous eventually it'll root event but

2684
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:04,159
those roots will be wimpier they'll be

2685
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:06,760
thinner they'll be more prone to um

2686
01:54:04,158 --> 01:54:08,519
developing the sheath the little uh

2687
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:11,320
melanation the little yellowing that

2688
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:13,679
happens right

2689
01:54:11,319 --> 01:54:14,639
hormones hormones are growth promoters

2690
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:16,800
at least the ones that we're talking

2691
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:19,960
about you know it's a very broad term a

2692
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:22,679
hormone is literally just a messenger uh

2693
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:24,399
a messenger molecule that doesn't need a

2694
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:26,158
lot it's the only thing that separates a

2695
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:27,399
hormone from like a nutrient you need a

2696
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:29,279
lot of a nutrient you need a good amount

2697
01:54:27,399 --> 01:54:31,559
of sugar you need very little adrenaline

2698
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:33,078
to get your PP heart pump it so from

2699
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:35,159
that perspective there are lots of

2700
01:54:33,078 --> 01:54:38,439
hormones some synthetic that only exist

2701
01:54:35,158 --> 01:54:41,078
in Labs some natural and and their wide

2702
01:54:38,439 --> 01:54:43,000
uh peel can be

2703
01:54:41,078 --> 01:54:44,880
utilized in ways that have no

2704
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,639
detrimental effects I mean I know people

2705
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:49,118
who are doing tissue culture they use

2706
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:51,078
hormones to keep their autoflow plants

2707
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:52,960
from autoflowering so they're just photo

2708
01:54:51,078 --> 01:54:55,319
period plants until they remove the

2709
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:58,480
hormones from their diet and then they

2710
01:54:55,319 --> 01:55:01,238
autoflow and now it's you know for them

2711
01:54:58,479 --> 01:55:05,198
for their propagative shason uh reasons

2712
01:55:01,238 --> 01:55:08,799
it it's very very beneficial for someone

2713
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:10,519
who is inheriting someone else's work

2714
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,960
and doesn't necessarily know the history

2715
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:15,280
that these plants have gone through yeah

2716
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,719
it's certainly a a risk to just put

2717
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:18,920
those plants directly into flour but I

2718
01:55:17,719 --> 01:55:20,760
think it would be a risk to put them

2719
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:22,760
into flour outside of tissue culture if

2720
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:24,480
you just inherit your budd's garden for

2721
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:26,079
different reasons maybe less about her

2722
01:55:24,479 --> 01:55:28,279
operation although that could still

2723
01:55:26,078 --> 01:55:30,279
happen if you don't validate the plants

2724
01:55:28,279 --> 01:55:32,519
before you just flower a room with them

2725
01:55:30,279 --> 01:55:34,880
uh and more so like with russet mites or

2726
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:38,800
py M this thought we talked about

2727
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:40,920
earlier um I'm not sure you know again I

2728
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,279
think it's more what you said before

2729
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:45,279
that it was probably something that the

2730
01:55:42,279 --> 01:55:49,319
cultivators did because this company

2731
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:51,039
doesn't sell plants that are in hormone

2732
01:55:49,319 --> 01:55:52,559
they sell I I you I'm not going to

2733
01:55:51,039 --> 01:55:54,439
mention the nursery's name but I'm sure

2734
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,360
you'll know who they are they sell

2735
01:55:54,439 --> 01:56:00,439
plants in Flats yeah that have tiny

2736
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:02,880
little you know like the organic plugs

2737
01:56:00,439 --> 01:56:04,960
and they have foil uh not foil but like

2738
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:06,039
plastic wrap over the top the vented

2739
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:08,800
wrap I know what you're talking about

2740
01:56:06,039 --> 01:56:11,960
right but the thing is like again

2741
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:14,480
hermaphrodism is always the Grower's

2742
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:16,279
fault I it might not be the end Grower's

2743
01:56:14,479 --> 01:56:18,959
fault if you're inheriting a plant from

2744
01:56:16,279 --> 01:56:23,039
someone else but like it is not a

2745
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:24,078
genetic trait right you can the easiest

2746
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:26,158
way to know would you agree that there

2747
01:56:24,078 --> 01:56:28,519
are some plants that tend to be more

2748
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:30,638
sensitive than others yeah prone yeah

2749
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:33,360
that's fair but okay take your most

2750
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:34,960
feminine plant like literally the most

2751
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:36,920
feminine plant you've ever had that will

2752
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,719
never hermaph under any circumstances

2753
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:41,960
spray that with silver thyo sulfate

2754
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:44,158
spray Cal Silver Sol codal silver and

2755
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:46,520
silver thyo sulfate are not DNA they're

2756
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:49,479
not impregnating they're not genetically

2757
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:51,119
modifying the plant they're shutting off

2758
01:56:49,479 --> 01:56:53,118
certain regulatory aspects the plant

2759
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:54,960
must still have the DNA DNA to then

2760
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:56,679
produce pollen Sachs if it's then going

2761
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,439
to produce pollen sacks and of course it

2762
01:56:56,679 --> 01:57:02,039
will because again it's not coincidental

2763
01:56:58,439 --> 01:57:06,279
it's mechanistic so cannabis can at any

2764
01:57:02,039 --> 01:57:08,519
time produce pollen sacks if the

2765
01:57:06,279 --> 01:57:11,198
environmental conditions are if it think

2766
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:12,840
have to survive right and it's your job

2767
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:16,279
if you don't want pollen sacks on your

2768
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:18,039
plants to not put those plants in those

2769
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:20,679
conditions that might that might

2770
01:57:18,039 --> 01:57:22,719
genuinely require you

2771
01:57:20,679 --> 01:57:24,880
growing less

2772
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:26,800
susceptible plants it's a stress I mean

2773
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:29,239
it's really like just like people some

2774
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:31,079
people handle stress very gracefully and

2775
01:57:29,238 --> 01:57:33,959
some people handle stress not as

2776
01:57:31,078 --> 01:57:35,359
gracefully right it's but it's a

2777
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:37,000
personal thing it's not a stress thing

2778
01:57:35,359 --> 01:57:39,118
stress is universal these plants have to

2779
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,399
be grown in an environment so the

2780
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:43,319
cultivator has to decide what

2781
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:46,879
environment it is um but you had

2782
01:57:43,319 --> 01:57:48,840
mentioned about the cancer of the

2783
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,199
callous is that something that can be

2784
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:52,800
remedied you know with time as well like

2785
01:57:51,198 --> 01:57:54,198
if you have a plant that just like that

2786
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:56,159
or is that something that you just get

2787
01:57:54,198 --> 01:57:58,799
excuse me yeah yeah I mean cancer is

2788
01:57:56,158 --> 01:58:01,319
Runaway growth just just remove it from

2789
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:03,920
its source and it'll stop and then put

2790
01:58:01,319 --> 01:58:07,759
it into a more appropriate source and

2791
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:11,199
cut it off yeah yeah the ability

2792
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:13,159
for this is like really really nuanced

2793
01:58:11,198 --> 01:58:16,799
uh molecular biology

2794
01:58:13,158 --> 01:58:19,839
but this is called epigenetics plants

2795
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:22,400
plants ability to differentiate to go

2796
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:26,639
from a stem cell into any type of mature

2797
01:58:22,399 --> 01:58:29,000
cell type and D differentiate go back is

2798
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,760
almost Universal they can go back and

2799
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,719
forth and back and forth and from one to

2800
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:35,119
another and back into another and so on

2801
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:36,840
this is why when you cut maybe a leaf

2802
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:38,880
close to where you're cloning you'll see

2803
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:41,840
a root come out of the damage pedal

2804
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:44,520
right maybe sometimes you see know like

2805
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:47,039
you those cells change their identity

2806
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:48,880
and sometimes if you see Vines they'll

2807
01:58:47,039 --> 01:58:50,198
grow out of the ground where the roots

2808
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,520
they become shoots and then they'll

2809
01:58:50,198 --> 01:58:53,439
touch the ground again and where they

2810
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,840
touch the ground more shoots gr out so

2811
01:58:53,439 --> 01:58:57,198
they can go back and forth whatever

2812
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:59,800
plants have extreme plasticity and the

2813
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:02,118
hormones regulate that um so if you

2814
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:03,920
change the hormones you just stop the

2815
01:59:02,118 --> 01:59:06,399
cancer it's radically different than

2816
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:08,560
obviously a Ming perspective of cancer

2817
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:10,359
where we're not plastic so once

2818
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:13,039
something converts from one type of

2819
01:59:10,359 --> 01:59:15,319
maturity to another it's extremely hard

2820
01:59:13,039 --> 01:59:18,000
for us to stop it and to get it to

2821
01:59:15,319 --> 01:59:19,319
another type or or to something else

2822
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
plants don't have that issue so just

2823
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:24,359
remove it from your cancer reducing

2824
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:26,319
media change the nutrients around the

2825
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:28,519
hormones around you can put the same

2826
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:30,399
plant right back in there and and see if

2827
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:32,960
the Cs will behave more appropriately

2828
01:59:30,399 --> 01:59:35,158
and if they get more normal

2829
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:38,000
morphology well we're going to have to

2830
01:59:35,158 --> 01:59:40,118
let you go in a couple minutes um one

2831
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,960
question I would Rec just this one

2832
01:59:40,118 --> 01:59:45,279
because this is really interesting uh

2833
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:48,439
500 cultivar you you are having in uh in

2834
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:51,238
grateful Head project yeah how do you

2835
01:59:48,439 --> 01:59:54,279
maintain is it like the same AAR for all

2836
01:59:51,238 --> 01:59:55,479
of them as I don't think so right I mean

2837
01:59:54,279 --> 01:59:59,000
because we are talking about night the

2838
01:59:55,479 --> 02:00:01,118
load of hormones in particular cultiv

2839
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,719
some cultiv like these some ctiv like

2840
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:07,198
you said you know how you do that how

2841
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:09,399
you maintain like 500 Cuts in tissue

2842
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:12,198
culture with a program yeah what we

2843
02:00:09,399 --> 02:00:14,000
initially did was okay you know what a

2844
02:00:12,198 --> 02:00:16,039
VIN diagram is when you have the two

2845
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,599
overlapping rings so it's like two

2846
02:00:16,039 --> 02:00:20,319
circles where this is distinct this is

2847
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:22,960
distin but the overlap shares right mhm

2848
02:00:20,319 --> 02:00:25,880
okay if you think of the Olympic rings

2849
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:27,679
as five sets of overlapping diagrams

2850
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:30,760
where they're all distinct but also have

2851
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:33,118
some similarity to their neighbor um

2852
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:35,039
that's how we started we had five

2853
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:37,559
different Medias and what we did was we

2854
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:39,639
stopped presuming we would know what the

2855
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:42,239
plant wanted we would blindly put it

2856
02:00:39,639 --> 02:00:43,840
into the shotgun approach we throw

2857
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:46,319
everything at the wall and whatever

2858
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:48,800
stuck that's where our next level of

2859
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:50,359
optimization would go from right we have

2860
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,039
been very fortunate to have worked with

2861
02:00:50,359 --> 02:00:56,078
so with what a number of cultivars at

2862
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:57,679
this point that um we actually do have a

2863
02:00:56,078 --> 02:01:00,519
universal media so that's what we do we

2864
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:04,679
just do one media for everything

2865
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:06,440
um just like the uh the cultivators that

2866
02:01:04,679 --> 02:01:08,920
I was so critical of growing all the

2867
02:01:06,439 --> 02:01:11,598
same strains in one room and then

2868
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:13,760
potentially some maiting out it is you

2869
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:16,119
know some will like that one media more

2870
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:18,320
than others none of them have shown in

2871
02:01:16,118 --> 02:01:20,719
our experience and there's always the

2872
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:22,279
next Plant to prove me wrong but

2873
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:24,158
thankfully

2874
02:01:22,279 --> 02:01:26,679
uh this media has worked exceptionally

2875
02:01:24,158 --> 02:01:28,920
well if ever comes a time where a plant

2876
02:01:26,679 --> 02:01:31,118
doesn't like that media we fortunately

2877
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:32,679
have this wide shotgun approach to fall

2878
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:35,078
back to but as you can presume for

2879
02:01:32,679 --> 02:01:37,480
optimization sake it's incredibly hard

2880
02:01:35,078 --> 02:01:39,158
to make five different t's for your

2881
02:01:37,479 --> 02:01:41,919
plants or five different nutrient

2882
02:01:39,158 --> 02:01:43,960
compositions like that um so we did

2883
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:46,639
Focus quite a like a year and a half on

2884
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:49,239
optimizing to a single media we're very

2885
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:52,279
thankful to have done so yeah thank you

2886
02:01:49,238 --> 02:01:55,000
man yeah that is something I was about

2887
02:01:52,279 --> 02:01:58,238
too I'm glad that uh that Sasha brought

2888
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,238
that up

2889
02:01:58,359 --> 02:02:05,439
um I I wanted to say that you know as

2890
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:08,440
with most of our podcasts you know we've

2891
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:10,759
spoken now for over two hours and I know

2892
02:02:08,439 --> 02:02:13,799
that we haven't scratched the surface we

2893
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:16,239
like the long term uh long form for

2894
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:18,679
format here so I hope we can get you to

2895
02:02:16,238 --> 02:02:20,799
come back and continue the conversation

2896
02:02:18,679 --> 02:02:23,880
I also wanted to ask you about possibly

2897
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:27,639
joining um wolf has another podcast on

2898
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:29,560
our Network called The Way We Grow and

2899
02:02:27,639 --> 02:02:31,520
maybe just doing because that show is a

2900
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:33,800
lot shorter it's like an hour but

2901
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:37,360
basically maybe just giving a basic

2902
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:41,199
rundown of tissue culture different ways

2903
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:43,519
people can do it um you know more for

2904
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:47,319
the I don't want to say entry level but

2905
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:50,000
just to inspire people cuz I do believe

2906
02:02:47,319 --> 02:02:52,519
that it's a valuable tool you know like

2907
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,238
all the other tools that we use um

2908
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:59,040
before we do go I don't you know I don't

2909
02:02:55,238 --> 02:03:02,158
think we talked enough about the

2910
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:04,000
grateful Head how you became involved

2911
02:03:02,158 --> 02:03:06,799
with them what your position is with

2912
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,960
them and you

2913
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:14,760
know we've had other guests like Kevin

2914
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:17,078
and Mark so our hopefully our um our

2915
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:21,119
audience is a little bit famili familiar

2916
02:03:17,078 --> 02:03:23,078
that you guys are a um repository for

2917
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:26,238
genetics

2918
02:03:23,078 --> 02:03:28,920
and um you're you know preserving them

2919
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:30,559
and you're selling gen zero clones which

2920
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:31,840
are probably the they're the cleanest

2921
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:36,440
clones you're going to get they may not

2922
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:37,880
be sanitized as we discussed earlier um

2923
02:03:36,439 --> 02:03:39,198
but how did you get involved with that

2924
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:41,480
project

2925
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:45,039
and I'm sure you're very excited about

2926
02:03:41,479 --> 02:03:47,519
it yeah absolutely um so I got I think

2927
02:03:45,039 --> 02:03:49,800
most of the members maybe that you

2928
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:53,360
talked to were pulled on by a guy named

2929
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:55,440
Steve um and and I was pretty unique in

2930
02:03:53,359 --> 02:03:56,719
that they had a relationship with the

2931
02:03:55,439 --> 02:04:00,558
lab

2932
02:03:56,719 --> 02:04:02,599
already and for whatever reason there

2933
02:04:00,559 --> 02:04:04,920
was a falling out in that relationship

2934
02:04:02,599 --> 02:04:06,800
and because they believe in the goal

2935
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:09,840
that they set out to do they looked for

2936
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:12,639
another lab and there's not many tissue

2937
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:14,639
culture Labs there are a number of labs

2938
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:16,920
doing tissue culture they're most often

2939
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:20,719
vertically integrated into a grow

2940
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:24,559
facility often into an MSO uh Multistate

2941
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:26,960
operator so being a third party and

2942
02:04:24,559 --> 02:04:29,000
getting your genetics into their hands

2943
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:31,639
and allowing them to clean them up is

2944
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,039
often very hard not not only like from

2945
02:04:31,639 --> 02:04:38,920
potentially a trust uh situation but

2946
02:04:34,039 --> 02:04:43,359
really just from will they even do it so

2947
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:45,359
Jason reached out SC uh reached out to

2948
02:04:43,359 --> 02:04:48,000
me because we had the relationship did

2949
02:04:45,359 --> 02:04:50,039
the class and basically asked if we

2950
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,118
wanted to be a part of it and was such

2951
02:04:50,039 --> 02:04:54,198
an amazing opportunity there there's no

2952
02:04:52,118 --> 02:04:58,439
way that we didn't want to be a part of

2953
02:04:54,198 --> 02:05:00,319
it jumped right on it um it's a pretty

2954
02:04:58,439 --> 02:05:04,678
amazing collection of

2955
02:05:00,319 --> 02:05:06,118
guys it's you know like many startups

2956
02:05:04,679 --> 02:05:09,039
it's

2957
02:05:06,118 --> 02:05:12,399
incredibly um fastpaced things feel like

2958
02:05:09,039 --> 02:05:14,479
they're changing all the time um

2959
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:16,598
fortunately on my end so I'm the chief

2960
02:05:14,479 --> 02:05:17,519
scientific officer CSO because I work

2961
02:05:16,599 --> 02:05:21,119
with the

2962
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:25,480
plants it's very very easy um I just

2963
02:05:21,118 --> 02:05:27,238
make sure that the plants look good um

2964
02:05:25,479 --> 02:05:30,158
everything like you said gen zero so we

2965
02:05:27,238 --> 02:05:33,718
go everything through marem and then we

2966
02:05:30,158 --> 02:05:37,158
uh sell those as clones to people we've

2967
02:05:33,719 --> 02:05:39,359
gotten incredible feedback uh everyone's

2968
02:05:37,158 --> 02:05:42,799
been like really really kind and really

2969
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:45,039
receptive to the project uh my heart

2970
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:47,880
goes out to all the sea Suites outside

2971
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:49,559
of me who deal with people find

2972
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:52,199
customers that's always the toughest

2973
02:05:49,559 --> 02:05:54,719
part of business in my opinion um um I'm

2974
02:05:52,198 --> 02:05:57,598
always very thankful to just look at

2975
02:05:54,719 --> 02:06:00,760
plants enjoy being in rooms with plants

2976
02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:03,119
even even now you know um and I hope to

2977
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:08,360
continue you know with this project

2978
02:06:03,118 --> 02:06:10,399
for as long as it manifests in like this

2979
02:06:08,359 --> 02:06:14,198
amazing

2980
02:06:10,399 --> 02:06:16,839
land well that's pretty awesome I think

2981
02:06:14,198 --> 02:06:18,598
while you may not enjoy it as much

2982
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:22,239
you're more of a people person than you

2983
02:06:18,599 --> 02:06:24,319
give yourself credit for so um I'm more

2984
02:06:22,238 --> 02:06:27,198
like a rambler according to my family

2985
02:06:24,319 --> 02:06:30,880
hey you know what I think that's a theme

2986
02:06:27,198 --> 02:06:33,359
on our show everyone we get as a rambler

2987
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:36,960
what I'll say is you speak a little bit

2988
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:39,679
slower and you allow us to uh you know

2989
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:41,359
there's breaks for us to ask questions I

2990
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:44,559
laugh that you know we had Michael wolf

2991
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:47,000
seagull and Kevin on the show and those

2992
02:06:44,559 --> 02:06:49,599
guys they have so much inside that they

2993
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:52,158
want to say that literally you got to

2994
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:53,920
like be like

2995
02:06:52,158 --> 02:06:56,039
you just listen you just listen to them

2996
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:57,679
and you know we loved it I I can't wait

2997
02:06:56,039 --> 02:07:00,479
to have wolf is going to have his own

2998
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:03,078
show on our Network and Kevin's going to

2999
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:06,039
be invited anytime he's got you know

3000
02:07:03,078 --> 02:07:08,319
time to do it and has something to say

3001
02:07:06,039 --> 02:07:10,319
so same goes for you like I said I I

3002
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:12,279
hope you'll come back and we can finish

3003
02:07:10,319 --> 02:07:14,359
this story and I definitely think it

3004
02:07:12,279 --> 02:07:17,800
would be cool if you did you know an

3005
02:07:14,359 --> 02:07:19,679
episode of The Way We Grow podcast um

3006
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:21,599
more I don't want to say for entry level

3007
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:24,000
people it could be for cultivators that

3008
02:07:21,599 --> 02:07:26,480
been growing for a long time but really

3009
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:29,639
don't have the knowledge of what tissue

3010
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:32,678
culture is sure and you know I always

3011
02:07:29,639 --> 02:07:35,239
tell our guests that you know this isn't

3012
02:07:32,679 --> 02:07:40,118
an infomercial we don't do a lot of

3013
02:07:35,238 --> 02:07:43,919
plugging but I really believe in you

uh repository that is growing every day

3026
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:19,480
and and they're starting to get the
