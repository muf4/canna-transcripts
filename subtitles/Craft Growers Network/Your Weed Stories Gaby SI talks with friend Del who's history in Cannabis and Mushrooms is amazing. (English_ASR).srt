00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,960
what's up everybody this is Gabby satin

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:22,159
Island before we start today's video I

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,240
wanted to apologize in advance for the

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,800
crummy audio on this podcast it's the

6
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,479
reason why we haven't released it sooner

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,400
I was considering re-recording it

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,759
because I CED the wrong mic and it

9
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,119
doesn't really sound as good as it

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,600
should but what I decided was this

11
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,799
content from Dell was so amazing and

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,640
spontaneous I didn't really want to lose

13
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,078
it by re-recording it and the truth is

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,640
he's doing most of the talking so I know

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,439
every now and again I'm asking some

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,600
questions here and there and it's not

17
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:54,358
going to sound that good but the stories

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,198
from Dell I think are really worth

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,719
tolerating it and I hope you guys do too

20
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,920
anyway I hope you guys enjoy this

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,920
podcast with my friend de

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,840
what's up everybody this is Gabby from

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,560
the craft Growers Network and I'm

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,920
excited to do another podcast with you

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,840
guys today of course as always we've got

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,560
Nick wolf hi guys and then and then our

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,040
special guest is Dell Potter he has an

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,320
amazing story that not only do I think

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,920
you've never heard you'll probably never

30
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,679
hear another story like this again um

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,439
he's got an amazing cannabis history

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,799
and also he's a modern day

33
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:40,879
psychedelic Pioneer a modern-day

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,320
psychedelic P Pioneer so um I think we

35
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,039
should just get into it Dell why don't

36
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,879
you just tell us a little bit about

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,159
yourself and then I'd like you to start

38
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,039
as early on in your uh story as you can

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,560
like even the first time you were

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,159
exposed to

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:01,519
cannabis sure uh yeah so uh my

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,960
background in training is in medical

43
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,759
anthropology uh and I ended up

44
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,679
specializing in uh a branch of that

45
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,680
called psychiatric anthropology I was

46
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,560
really focused on uh using the

47
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,000
anthropological perspective to sort of

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,280
transform the way we approach mental

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,400
health interventions and

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,680
Psychiatry uh and and that was really

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,519
you know my my focus throughout my

52
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,680
academic years uh I had some clinical

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,239
training at the San Francisco

54
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,080
psychoanalytic Institute uh and thought

55
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,519
I was kind of going to go in the

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,519
direction of being a clinician a a a

57
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,920
more informed type of

58
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,039
clinician uh didn't use psychology as

59
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,799
the basis but rather anthropology which

60
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:57,158
I thought ask different questions uh you

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,840
know we ask the same questions of a

62
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,799
person that you would ask of a culture

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,598
you know how does this person exist in

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,360
the world where do they get their you

65
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,959
know food from how do they survive who

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,159
who are their relationships and that to

67
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,158
me that perspective was more I think

68
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:19,000
beneficial than psychology which focused

69
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,359
far more on intas Psychic factors so I

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,318
started out looking to be a clinician

71
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,840
and then I had a a really transformative

72
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:33,199
experience uh early on and that was I

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:36,000
went to a a party uh a faculty party uh

74
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,079
at UC Berkeley at the anthropology

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,719
department and again it was a different

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:54,480
time that it was 19 uh 71 I I 1971 1972

77
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:56,039
um and uh I was really struck by uh the

78
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,280
well first of all let me just describe

79
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:03,359
this party everyone was a was dressed in

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,878
Period costume like from the 19th

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,680
century uh there was a guy who looked

82
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:12,000
exactly like Mozart playing the

83
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,760
piano uh and he was playing perfectly

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,639
Mozart piano

85
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,279
concertos uh and this is kind of what I

86
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,918
found is that anthropologists tend to be

87
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,638
Renaissance people that is they have

88
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:26,000
talent in all these different areas and

89
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,360
so I'm walking around this party and

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
there are luminaries in anthropology

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,479
Paul rabau and Clifford girs uh people

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,839
who are pretty famous and they were

93
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,639
arguing about some aspect of uh how we

94
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,599
interpret culture and stuff like that so

95
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,319
I'm I'm kind of bouncing around this

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,639
party and uh I see a bunch of people

97
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:50,759
that are kind of collected in a group

98
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:54,319
and it's mostly undergraduates and

99
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,240
everybody's smoking weed let me you know

100
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:59,399
faculty students everybody smoking weed

101
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,600
there's a haze of weed throughout the

102
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,959
room and I'm holding a glass of red wine

103
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,080
uh and I walk over and it's this uh

104
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:11,839
researcher who I've actually been at a

105
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,478
seminar in uh at esselon which I if you

106
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,519
guys aren't familiar with esselon I'll

107
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:20,758
tell you a little bit about that but um

108
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:22,599
it was the uh researcher claudo nanho uh

109
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:27,080
he's pretty famous for doing the early

110
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,319
iasa studies uh and developing a kind of

111
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:33,959
an approach to Shamanism and teaching

112
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:37,520
sham ISM so I had met him at esselon and

113
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,799
so I walked over he recognized me and uh

114
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,038
we just started you know chatting and he

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,879
said look uh you know you would really

116
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:49,680
like to meet uh Alexander

117
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:52,038
schan uh I'm going to be going to their

118
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,400
Salon get togethers that they have on

119
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:57,399
Friday nights would you like to come

120
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,638
with me and I was I'd heard about

121
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,679
Alexander shulan and I I was like thr

122
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:07,240
thrilled to come you know to some event

123
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,959
like that uh so I I ended up meeting him

124
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,400
and we went to and I I met Alexander

125
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:17,519
schulgen and his wife uh for the first

126
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:23,719
time and uh a number of other people who

127
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:26,000
were sort of 60s icons uh Allan gin do

128
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,680
you mind for you know many people may

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,120
not know who schan is can you just

130
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,720
briefly tell who he is

131
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,478
in many ways the father of modern

132
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:40,319
psychedelic chemistry he uh didn't

133
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:43,199
invent MDMA but he discovered a more

134
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,759
efficient synthesis route than anybody

135
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,319
had previously and uh he experimented

136
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,919
with novel

137
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,000
chemistry uh he invented

138
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,519
2cb uh you know he worked with DMT five

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,720
methoxy

140
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:04,598
DMT uh a whole range of Tri amines and

141
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,919
phenoline uh basically phenoline being

142
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:12,199
masculine type related compounds

143
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:15,318
tryptamines being LSD psilocybin DMT

144
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,560
related compounds and he played around

145
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,879
with novel chemistry in all of these

146
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,879
areas and developed many of the

147
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,199
Psychedelic compounds that have become

148
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:29,319
the basis of research today and his wife

149
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:33,199
an was a uh a psychotherapist and she

150
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:37,039
kind kind of bridged the chemistry to

151
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:40,520
the person in a way uh so uh these

152
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:43,759
salons were pretty intense meetings uh

153
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:46,799
all these people who were you know icons

154
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,800
as I said in the 60s Ken key would be

155
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,680
there uh you know uh Alan Ginsburg Allan

156
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,560
Watts I met Terrence McKenna there uh a

157
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,319
lot of very interesting people would

158
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,439
show up and it was a highly charged

159
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,439
intellectual atmosphere

160
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,519
uh what I really liked about it it was

161
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,519
real interdisciplinary you'd have

162
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:10,158
artists you'd have musicians you'd have

163
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,359
chemists psychedelic chemists you'd have

164
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:15,598
psychologists and psychiatrists all

165
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,360
interacting and and finding a lot of

166
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,038
common ground together well so claudo

167
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,840
Nano takes me to this meeting and I

168
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,959
intro I'm introduced to shulan for the

169
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,918
first time he says hey I understand

170
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,519
you're interested in research around the

171
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:34,478
short acting Tre trip to means because I

172
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:38,000
was doing research on iasa and uh

173
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,120
indigenous use of iasa at that time and

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,278
uh he said you know look let me uh I'd

175
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,360
love to talk chemistry with you and he

176
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:50,838
kind of gave me a master class over uh

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,680
about a Year's period uh in that genre C

178
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,600
Class of chemicals the short acting

179
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,199
tryptamines is short acting uh I'm sorry

180
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,278
quick question is short acting just mean

181
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,800
like rapid onset both rapid onset and

182
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:08,720
short duration you know uh DMT you know

183
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:12,120
15 minutes 20 minutes uh the the

184
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,839
experience is almost over and within

185
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,360
half an hour you're back on the ground

186
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,720
you're maybe a little sparkly but uh you

187
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,680
know it's a very short acting experience

188
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,600
and five methoxy DMT is not

189
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:30,599
dissimilar uh so that really changed my

190
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,759
direction meeting him I ended up going

191
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
more in the direction of specializing in

192
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:38,278
neuropharmacology and

193
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,399
chemistry uh and just kind of altered my

194
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:45,000
life's path uh when I went to that party

195
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,639
that night I saw Allan Ginsburg he was

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,360
uh sitting on the floor writing poetry

197
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:54,078
and uh I had met him before at a

198
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,240
conference uh one of the earliest

199
00:09:54,078 --> 00:10:00,519
psychedelic conference that Maps put on

200
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,360
uh the multi uh disciplinary Association

201
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,679
for psychedelic studies which now is

202
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,800
pretty famous for bringing forward MDMA

203
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:11,479
as a treatment for PTSD uh they've had

204
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,439
uneven success but you know back then

205
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,000
they were first starting out and this

206
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,720
was a a one of the first psychedelic

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,839
conferences and I remember I had met

208
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:27,000
Alan Ginsburg at this thing uh he was on

209
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:30,200
a panel with uh a Buddhist teacher named

210
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,600
truna and um

211
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:38,320
Romos Richard Alpert uh you know the

212
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,519
other half of Timothy ly um and you know

213
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,879
the panel I thought was really funny

214
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,039
because and it it immediately you know I

215
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,838
had some immediate Affinity with Alan

216
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,278
Ginsburg uh

217
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,000
because somebody in the audience asked

218
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:51,759
the question when was the last time you

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,639
took

220
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,439
LSD and truna said oh it was about 10

221
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,720
years ago now I found this new path you

222
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,720
know I I don't need it anymore or that

223
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,680
it opened the door for me but now I

224
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,120
found you know a a a a way to maintain

225
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,359
that type of State without drugs and

226
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,440
then uh rdos kind of said the same thing

227
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,720
he said you know uh I haven't had it for

228
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,120
five years uh I've I've opened the door

229
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,560
and now I'm going

230
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,200
through and Ginsburg got up there he

231
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:27,239
said well I'm on it now I thought it

232
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,600
would be a uh you know appropriate for

233
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,000
me to take it you know like an hour for

234
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,240
this this panel and I was immediately oh

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,440
yeah that's my guy you know uh and I I

236
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,360
saw him later on he asked me if he could

237
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,880
get a ride back to San

238
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,639
Francisco and I gave I had him in the

239
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,039
back of my car driving back to San

240
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:52,120
Francisco so I'm asking this guy every

241
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:55,599
question about Jack kowak about Neil

242
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,278
Cassidy uh you know all the beats and

243
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,040
you know he when I went to shulan's

244
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,439
party he saw me and he immediately

245
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:07,439
recognized

246
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:10,200
me um so that party was really a turning

247
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,079
point for me I decided you know these

248
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,278
people were inspiring and you know it

249
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,679
was a different time back then uh you

250
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,078
know it was a time when drug

251
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,958
manufacturing and drug trafficking I

252
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:23,919
think was was more or less looked at as

253
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,039
a high

254
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:30,919
calling uh it was a very special kind of

255
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,319
group that shulan represented and they

256
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,919
inspired me uh and I looked up to them

257
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,639
and I wanted to grow up to be a drug

258
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:42,039
trafficker and manufacture myself you

259
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,680
know and uh we had kind of an idea that

260
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:47,399
this was a Messianic purpose we were out

261
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:51,239
spreading the Psychedelic message and

262
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,679
you know the laws were not really

263
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,600
important to us you know it was a time

264
00:12:53,679 --> 00:13:00,159
also I should say of Civil Disobedience

265
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,519
the war in Vietnam uh was still underway

266
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,278
and people were protesting and

267
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,959
protesting against the value system that

268
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,679
kind of supported that war so drug

269
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,000
trafficking drug manufacturing was

270
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,838
looked at as a kind of Civil

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,039
Disobedience uh it wasn't looked at you

272
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:24,639
in 1971 just out of

273
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:28,838
curiosity I was 19 okay cool um so I was

274
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:32,360
you know young and easy to lead around

275
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:35,560
you know know and and I had taken LSD

276
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,800
when I was 15 uh and that that

277
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,879
experience was transformative too for me

278
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:47,120
it kind of sent me in a particular

279
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:49,639
direction uh and it was uh Oley LSD um

280
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,000
it was an owley double dome which I

281
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,399
think you were supposed to split them in

282
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,120
half but I just took the whole thing

283
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,039
which ended up being about 300

284
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,560
micrograms so it was a pretty powerful

285
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:04,919
experience you know it was I connected

286
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:07,599
to Universal Consciousness floated above

287
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:10,559
my body you know a lot of stuff happened

288
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,480
and to me that that message translated

289
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,679
to you know I I want to spread this

290
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,720
message I want to make these compounds

291
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,838
available to people it it it kind of

292
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,040
became that

293
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,880
simple so that was that was kind of the

294
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,039
turning point for me you know I

295
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,639
continued you know I I did a lot of

296
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,480
research among uh indigenous groups

297
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,959
throughout Latin America trying to learn

298
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,079
and understand about the history of uh

299
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:41,000
psychedelic use uh I worked with the

300
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:44,399
kofan in Colombia uh the shuar in

301
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,958
Ecuador uh the yanami people in Brazil

302
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,480
and I spent quite a bit of time with the

303
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:52,958
yamami people in Brazil and that's where

304
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,000
I had kind of my first uh DMT experience

305
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,399
uh and that this had been previous to

306
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,720
when I went to that party at shogan I uh

307
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,278
I had

308
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,560
a

309
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:09,278
uh they what they do is they have a uh a

310
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:12,359
blow gun that they use to hunt uh birds

311
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:15,278
and they they get uh seeds and

312
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,079
Botanicals that are high in five methoxy

313
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,799
DMT and DMT and they make like this

314
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:22,679
bolus and they put it in the in the

315
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,639
bamboo blow gun and you put it up your

316
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,599
nose and another guy blows it up your

317
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,240
nose right and uh I think they were

318
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
trying to teach me a lesson about dosage

319
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,198
you

320
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:40,719
know uh and uh that hit the back of my

321
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:42,758
throat and I was um I was suddenly

322
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,399
higher than I ever could possibly

323
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,759
imagine being in like seconds it's like

324
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,039
being shot out of a cannon and uh

325
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,039
foreground and background changed places

326
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,039
my unconscious came forward and my

327
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,599
conscious mind receded and I was like

328
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:01,439
whoa this is something else um so that's

329
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
why I I got interested in the shorter

330
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,920
acting tripto means was from that

331
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:08,599
experience so I ended up doing a lot of

332
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:12,000
This research I also did research among

333
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,959
the maitech in uh Central Mexico in a

334
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,440
little town called Wata de himz which

335
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,198
was famous for introducing uh psilocybin

336
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,600
mushrooms to the world in

337
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:27,838
1957 uh a uh JP Morgan Banker R Gordon

338
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,440
Wason who had written a book called s

339
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,920
the Divine mushroom of

340
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,600
immortality and that book he um pitched

341
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:38,278
the idea that in the viic scriptures

342
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,759
there is a description of a substance

343
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:44,720
called soma which uh produces

344
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,240
Enlightenment and he argued that it was

345
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,839
Amanita muscaria that was being talked

346
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,399
about that red mushroom with the the

347
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,920
white Flex on it and uh he was the first

348
00:16:53,399 --> 00:17:00,240
one to lead a party that went to wat de

349
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:03,479
Jimenez uh to have a siloc cybin

350
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,078
mushroom ceremony and so I went there

351
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,038
and did research there and uh you know

352
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,359
while I was there I was kind of looking

353
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,279
around uh one of the things I'll tell

354
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,879
you is you

355
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,720
know people don't realize that going to

356
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,720
graduate school that's like a form of

357
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,480
slavery you know they want to work you

358
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,558
as much as possible for like no money so

359
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,120
I was really having trouble getting by

360
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,879
and I was kind of thinking I'm gon to

361
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,479
need some side hustle if I'm ever going

362
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,720
to make it through

363
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,640
uh graduate school and when I was with

364
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,319
the maitech this idea just kind of

365
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,440
popped into my

366
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,720
head uh cuz they had shown me the

367
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,679
mushrooms growing and I saw them growing

368
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,079
and I said you know they showed me the

369
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,080
ones that kind of grew easily out of Cow

370
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,199
Patties uh psilocybe cubensis it's

371
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,678
widely used now it's the mushroom of

372
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,679
Commerce but back then it was just sort

373
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,919
of a wild mushroom and I got this idea

374
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,440
I'm going to culture that that mushroom

375
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,960
I'm going to take the cultures into the

376
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,080
United States I'm going to figure out

377
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,240
how to grow it commercially and I'm

378
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:09,240
going to start growing them uh and

379
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,359
that'll be my you know little side

380
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,319
hustle that allow me to get through

381
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:16,959
Graduate

382
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:20,359
School uh so I and had you ever grown

383
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,240
any mushrooms at that point no I I knew

384
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:26,479
a lot about mushroom taxonomy uh you

385
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,120
know just from studying uh

386
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,000
ethnobotany uh with the maitech but I

387
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,119
didn't really know anything about

388
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,759
cultivation or how to grow them or

389
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:39,279
anything uh and so I started reading

390
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:42,640
like mad and so I was self-taught and

391
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:45,000
set up a motel well I ended up okay I'm

392
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
going to go get some cultures they said

393
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,679
you know where you really want to get

394
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,559
the best ones are in

395
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:55,038
chapas uh in pen outside of pen and I

396
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,240
had kind of a crude map you know and I

397
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,119
thought I'd just go down there I'm going

398
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,759
to find these mushrooms do a live tissue

399
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,119
culture and you know isolate that

400
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,079
culture smuggle those cultures into the

401
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,678
United States and figure out how to grow

402
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,079
them and uh you know you you could find

403
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,240
these mushrooms in the United States uh

404
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:17,599
you know in southern latitudes uh in the

405
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,000
rainy season but the ones that were in

406
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:24,240
the region around pen I was assured were

407
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,919
like way better and you know these were

408
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,120
the state-of-the-art so I ended up

409
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,159
taking whatever little money I had had

410
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:35,119
you know my aunt would give me

411
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:38,280
a you know money for books and you know

412
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:41,000
uh you know basic expenses and I ended

413
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:46,440
up putting that into a flight to

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,798
pen and uh was determined to find them

415
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,798
and isolate the culture and you know it

416
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:55,119
was kind of a an unusual time in that

417
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,519
region because there was a zapatista

418
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,239
Uprising and if you don't know about the

419
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,720
zapatistas they were

420
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,720
they were a collection of indigenous

421
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,558
groups four or five different indigenous

422
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,120
groups who basically declared an

423
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:11,440
independent state in that area and The

424
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,719
Mexican government was like freaked out

425
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,880
like is this going to be the beginning

426
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,200
of some kind of indigenous

427
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,120
Revolution and they ordered the Army to

428
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,519
go down there and uh mess with them but

429
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,558
the Army would not fire on indigenous

430
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:28,759
people they just there's that's a real

431
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:30,279
cultural uh boundary in Mexico the you

432
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,480
know indigenous people represent the

433
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,440
cultural Soul of Mexico so they they

434
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,558
couldn't really get the Army to interact

435
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,000
with them so they just kind of isolated

436
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:42,519
them and uh so I went down to that

437
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,079
region at that time and so it was it was

438
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,240
a little it was a little scary you'd

439
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,359
have to go through roadblocks and stuff

440
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,839
like that and so I one of the things

441
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:54,000
that distinguishes pen are the

442
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:56,359
archaeological ruins there there

443
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,079
are you know somebody was standing in

444
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,479
the jungle and they saw like a little

445
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,879
tiny

446
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,519
uh you know piece of rock that they

447
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,400
thought might be some kind of indigenous

448
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:08,839
archaeological site and they started

449
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,400
digging and they found a whole city

450
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:15,720
underneath uh you know all this uh

451
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,759
jungle and a pyramid and you know a

452
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,720
whole a whole city and uh so I was

453
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:24,038
fascinated with those ruins and I'm I'm

454
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,120
thinking well how am I going to find

455
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,599
these mushrooms I got to go around and I

456
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:31,359
was sitting in a canteen in a nice um

457
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:35,319
there was this Mexican hippie who was

458
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:37,759
sitting there in one table and you know

459
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:38,839
he came up to me and said hey uh Gringo

460
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,319
you want to get some

461
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:45,439
mushrooms and I said yeah I'm exactly

462
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:48,639
looking for that can you get me some and

463
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,558
uh the first day he brings me these like

464
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,640
regular mushrooms and is going to try

465
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:56,960
and like sell them to me and thinking

466
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,278
I'm like stupid enough to mistake

467
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,679
regular mushrooms for psych

468
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,720
mushrooms and I said no get the hell out

469
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,720
of here that's you know that's not going

470
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,159
to work and he came back very apologetic

471
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,480
the next day and he said look I can take

472
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,559
you to where the mushrooms are growing

473
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,880
um and I have a family an uncle who's a

474
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:20,079
shaman so I know all about these

475
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,120
mushrooms and I I said great let let's

476
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:25,720
go and he says I I I'll just charge you

477
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,639
a daily fee as a guide and I didn't have

478
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,480
much money and I was like okay let's

479
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,240
let's do this

480
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,038
uh and so we started going out looking

481
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,599
for mushrooms uh and the first places we

482
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:40,278
went to were super disappointing you

483
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,480
know I got to this one place it was

484
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:45,798
really dry I I actually found some

485
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,519
mushrooms but they were all dried up

486
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:50,119
specimens uh and we we walked through

487
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:53,519
this cow pasture and these were like

488
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,519
some of the sicklesteel

489
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,000
that they have in Mexico so I'm walking

490
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:05,038
through in my shorts and you know

491
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,558
sandals and then realize that

492
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,400
something's crawling on me and it's some

493
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,519
of these little tiny ticks so I go nuts

494
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,679
trying to get them off of me and the guy

495
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:17,038
tells me hey uh those dicks will crawl

496
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,278
up any hole they can find and make a

497
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,200
home there and uh I'm just freaked out

498
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:25,880
right so that was you

499
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:29,960
know un yeah that was one unsuccessful

500
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:33,240
day and finally after a number of false

501
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,519
starts he says okay this is the one this

502
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,919
is the time we're going you know and all

503
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,720
the time we're doing this we have to

504
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:42,159
drive through a a military check and

505
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,600
it's a bunch of these kids standing

506
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,400
there they 17 years old with

507
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:54,599
AK-47s and they scrutinize me but they

508
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,400
mostly talk to him right Gringo and uh a

509
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,798
a

510
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,679
Mexican together in the same car they're

511
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:01,960
looking for drugs drugs there's drugs

512
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,400
here somewhere some kind of drugs in are

513
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,079
involved so they they kind of did a

514
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,120
cursory search you know but they were

515
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,038
they were giving me an eyeball like what

516
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:16,000
are you doing I know there's something

517
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:19,079
up here so we went directly to the

518
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,119
pyramid in pen which I had been kind of

519
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,439
walk you know doing jogging around every

520
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,278
morning just for exercise so we turn

521
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,759
around we go directly to the pyramid and

522
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:31,159
he finds this Trail leading away from

523
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,119
the pyramid that goes into the jungle so

524
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:35,919
we're going through the jungle and again

525
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,398
I'm in my uh tennis shoes this time

526
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,799
because I I wanted a little better

527
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:44,918
Footwear and we're going through the

528
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:46,440
jungle parrots uh a little light rain

529
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,720
Mist starts

530
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:53,320
falling uh and we we come out of the

531
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,240
Jungle and we cross this River and now

532
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:58,599
I'm up to my waist in a river crossing

533
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,919
it and I'm all well the part's over here

534
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:02,199
you know I'm going to be soaked for the

535
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,278
rest of the day I hope we find something

536
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,278
and we come out into this pasture that's

537
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:09,359
like this gorgeous pasture with this

538
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,240
grass that's like that Hawaiian crab

539
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,798
grass that has like a cushion to it uh

540
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,880
and and in this field are these Jersey

541
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,558
cows some of the most beautiful cows

542
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,520
I've ever seen in Mexico and there's Cow

543
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,639
Patties throughout this field and there

544
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,158
they are giant specimens of mushrooms

545
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,600
just growing

546
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:33,760
perfectly and so I I put together a

547
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,959
little lab in the motel I was staying at

548
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,359
in the bathroom lined it with plastic

549
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,840
and set up a a sort of a lab to do the

550
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:44,278
culture work and I had like a funky

551
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:46,558
glove box that I used and a little

552
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,839
pressure cooker with me to make uh

553
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,359
mushroom media and uh ended up going

554
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,798
back to that spot and collecting all

555
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:58,519
these specimens and they were gigantic

556
00:25:54,798 --> 00:26:01,079
you know really vigorous strain uh a

557
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:04,679
variety of of

558
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:08,839
cubas isolated the cultures successfully

559
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:11,360
put them into test tubes and now all I

560
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,000
had to do was get them across the border

561
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,639
uh at this time again nobody to ever

562
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,960
really thought about psilocybin

563
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,840
mushrooms except maybe in Texas and

564
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,880
Florida where they grew wild and they

565
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:25,720
would chase kids out of cow pastors who

566
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,000
were looking for them uh but nobody had

567
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,640
ever thought of growing them

568
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,079
commercially

569
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:39,278
so I I had this friend uh an older

570
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:43,519
man uh his name is George uh George Shaw

571
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:45,839
and uh he was you know a really close

572
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,960
friend who was basically a

573
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:52,398
Smuggler uh he would go across the

574
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:55,679
border to nogalus on a regular basis uh

575
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:58,918
but he was also a a Coke Smuggler and

576
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,200
all kinds of other types of smuggling

577
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,960
uh and I know he was quite Adept at

578
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,159
getting back and forth across the border

579
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,840
because he looks so innocuous he's about

580
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,559
5'6 uh looked like he had a big white

581
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:12,959
beard and looked like a leprechaun

582
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,639
version of Santa Claus he was so

583
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,038
charming and disarming that people would

584
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,679
just never look twice at him so we had

585
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:23,599
this thermos and in these days the

586
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,159
thermoses had these sleeves that you

587
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:29,798
could take out so I stuck the uh culture

588
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,720
tubes in inside the thermos put the

589
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:33,798
sleeve back in he filled it up with

590
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,319
coffee so it looked like he could just

591
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:39,240
it was just a coffee thermos right the

592
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,798
coffee wasn't hot no the coffee was hot

593
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,159
but it was insulated it yeah it was

594
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:48,759
insulated uh there was an insulation

595
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,320
between it and the culture tubes so uh

596
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,038
he just went right across the border I

597
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,918
was waiting in no Gallas and now I had

598
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:57,480
the cultures in the United States uh so

599
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,320
now I had to figure out how to grow them

600
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,159
so I I was living in a little apartment

601
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,240
in Berkeley I figured you know uh I've

602
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:06,559
got to get to a more rural location and

603
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,120
I was just kind of looking around where

604
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,879
should I go and I ended up uh at in

605
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:15,879
looking in Sebastapol

606
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,600
uh just outside of Santa Rosa uh and

607
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,919
there's these I Live Now yeah very small

608
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:26,158
little ranchets you know two acres three

609
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,519
acres up to 5 Acres sometimes but quite

610
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,640
isolated and I I said well this is

611
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:33,120
perfect this is I I found a rental there

612
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,480
and decided you know this is where I'm

613
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:39,199
going to do my proof of concept and I

614
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,759
wanted to duplicate what I'd seen in

615
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:47,319
nature so I uh researched compost and

616
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:50,200
made a compost pile of washed cow

617
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:55,319
manure uh because that was kind of what

618
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:57,840
I saw in nature and straw uh and read

619
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:02,519
about composting and mushroom compost

620
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:05,918
and and got together uh enough compost

621
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,480
for four beds that I laid out in various

622
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,120
locations three were kind of indirect

623
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,120
sunlight one was under modeled sunlight

624
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,119
Under The Canopy of a tree and then I

625
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:20,119
seated them with spawn which I learned

626
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:23,119
out how to make uh just self-taught

627
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:25,678
and the ones that were in the sun they

628
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,398
didn't make it though the mycelium

629
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
didn't survive I covered it all with

630
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:35,038
plastic but the one that was Under The

631
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,720
Canopy it was uh cool enough that the

632
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,879
entire substrate was

633
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,960
colonized and I thought well now what I

634
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,919
want to duplicate after having colonized

635
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:51,679
this little uh I I kind of just laid

636
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:55,080
them out on a 4ot by 8 foot uh kind of

637
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,640
little about four or five in thick

638
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:00,879
compost bed and I I said well now I've

639
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,240
got to duplicate what happens in pen I'm

640
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,399
just going to you know make rain so I'm

641
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,079
going to water them so I pulled the

642
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:09,518
plastic off of them it's all fully

643
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,720
colonized and just started you know

644
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,278
raining on them and thinking well you

645
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,600
know that's that's going to duplicate

646
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,240
what I see in nature you know after a

647
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:21,398
few days nothing's happening I'm getting

648
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:24,480
discouraged I'm also working at a job um

649
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:26,959
a cultural resource study at Lake mesino

650
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,278
which hadn't been flooded at that point

651
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,159
and they were trying to preserve the

652
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,558
cultural resources before they flooded

653
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,120
it with a dam so I'm commuting up to

654
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,720
Yukaya from Sebastapol and I have a

655
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,359
friend who's kind of watching it and I

656
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,240
said look just water this once a day you

657
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:45,519
know give it a nice watering uh and just

658
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,960
tell me if anything happens and he calls

659
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,159
me up and says hey I think you should

660
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,558
come back cuz something's going on here

661
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,640
and I come back and there's like two

662
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:56,038
little mushrooms coming out of the

663
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,159
middle of the bed I was like astonished

664
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:01,000
you know wow this worked you know but if

665
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,519
I have to make all this compost to get

666
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,638
two little mushrooms that's not going to

667
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:08,519
work you know so I continue to water it

668
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:12,119
and over the course of a week suddenly a

669
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:14,798
carpet of mushrooms grew like a a whole

670
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,759
edgo Edge canopy every single square

671
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,200
inch of that bed was covered with

672
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:22,038
mushrooms and some of them were

673
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,080
gigantic uh you know I harvested one

674
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:29,919
that weighed a pound uh and and dried

675
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:32,720
down to about an ounce uh and you know I

676
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,919
now I have the problem of how do I got

677
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,159
to pick these things and I got to dry

678
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,600
them successfully my first experiments

679
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,559
of drying didn't work out well because I

680
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,439
tried to dry at a low temperature

681
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:45,918
because I wanted to you know preserve

682
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,038
the active principle that was in in the

683
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,679
mushrooms and that would actually turn

684
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:55,720
them black because it was it was like

685
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:58,679
too cold and I ended up using the well

686
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,399
no they were just like oxidizing yeah no

687
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,960
what they have this bluing reaction uh

688
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:08,000
when when uh psychedelic mushrooms hit

689
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,519
the air they create this bluing reaction

690
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,240
and I was making that worse you know

691
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,159
like making it even darker with cold air

692
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,240
so what I did is I set these racks up

693
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:21,000
over the heater vents in my house and

694
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,638
just started stacking them up and that

695
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,119
started working they started coming out

696
00:32:23,638 --> 00:32:28,398
perfect really white white stems and

697
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,759
beautiful

698
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:34,479
gold caps that were like look like gold

699
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:36,919
you know and at first I was like I'm

700
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,038
going to cut all the tops off and I'll

701
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,679
put the stems in the middle and then

702
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:41,398
I'll line the outside of the bag with

703
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,960
the

704
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:46,038
caps and everybody was well I'm just

705
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,000
going to take the Caps the stems they

706
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:50,879
must be lesser quality because you put

707
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,679
them in the middle and

708
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,840
conceptually yeah you know it's just

709
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,720
like everything's so primitive because

710
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,678
nobody's ever done it before I'm I'm

711
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,919
going to have to figure out how to make

712
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,639
these things presentable and

713
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:06,240
cosmetically appealing you know uh so I

714
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:09,719
ended up understanding that you just

715
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,679
have to cut the mushrooms whole dry them

716
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,960
whole and lay them carefully in the bag

717
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,600
and that way nobody will think that you

718
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,120
know this is good and this is bad and so

719
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,439
that's how I start packaging them and

720
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,638
they're coming out really beautiful like

721
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,600
all these gold caps and white white

722
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:28,558
stems and like now I've got to figure

723
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:31,638
out where I'm going to sell them

724
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:34,839
uh and I knew a guy because he had lived

725
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:37,398
down the street uh his name was David

726
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:40,079
Logan that's his actual real name uh

727
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:44,000
probably shouldn't say

728
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:47,319
that i'mna cut his uh his nickname was

729
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,839
DL uh and I should say that uh in those

730
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:52,240
days in the drug trafficking millu

731
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,319
everybody had these

732
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,240
nicknames uh and so his nickname was DL

733
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:02,519
and he was from he was from

734
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,759
uh Brooklyn and he was a real character

735
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,200
uh he had all these sayings he's kind of

736
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:09,159
a New York guy in California and he had

737
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,000
all these sayings for people like he had

738
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,720
a guy who drove for him and he called

739
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,719
him that's my punk in the trunk and uh

740
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:21,519
he he he would say stuff like money

741
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:23,480
talks [ __ ] walks and you know uh you

742
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,759
know he he got divorced from his wife

743
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,679
and he he he told me uh you know the the

744
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,960
payments that he had to make make to her

745
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,280
were the [ __ ] I get for the [ __ ] I

746
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,398
got uh and he just had all these funny

747
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,800
sayings about all this

748
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:43,279
stuff really uh Char yeah we really hit

749
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,519
it off and he was famous as the guy who

750
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,359
was the acid connection at wood at

751
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:51,519
Woodstock he was the guy who made

752
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:54,078
Woodstock essentially because of all the

753
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,918
LSD he he brought to it he wasn't the

754
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,920
guy with the brown acid he wasn't the

755
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,519
brown acidy he wasn't the brown acid was

756
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,760
the good acid and so he came out to

757
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:05,920
California with his partner and his

758
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,720
partner was this guy M Miami Sammy and

759
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,480
we called him uh we called him Sam Sammy

760
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,319
two sticks because he was paraplegic and

761
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,440
he would run around on two sticks all

762
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,800
the time you know on crutches but what

763
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,119
was so funny is he had this wheelchair

764
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,920
and he decked it out uh and he would he

765
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,720
would be in clubs and and all over town

766
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,480
with this wheelchair and he had like a a

767
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:34,358
mobile bar set up in it and he had like

768
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,079
drawers with all kinds of different weed

769
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:39,559
in it and it was just kind of like his

770
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:43,119
mobile dispensary he would get around in

771
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:45,320
um so he he hooked up with Miami Sammy

772
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,960
came out to the coast and he he just

773
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,318
started selling weed and you know

774
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,280
ecstasy and all kinds of stuff in

775
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:57,039
California and he he was pretty much the

776
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,079
guy you know uh started selling Tai weed

777
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,960
you know it at that time there were all

778
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:04,599
these you know

779
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,358
Regional uh varieties of of of cannabis

780
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,160
from around the world and that and

781
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:09,639
that's how you sort of identified what

782
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,078
the experience was going to be like you

783
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:13,759
had all these varieties from Mexico you

784
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,280
had some varieties from Colombia

785
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,640
varieties from Thailand and he started

786
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:22,119
selling Tai weed and became famous for

787
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:24,159
that anyway so I knew because he sold

788
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,640
LSD that he was probably the likely

789
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,039
person I need to bring these mushrooms

790
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:30,960
to so I brought him to him and he was

791
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:33,079
like yeah this is really great but uh I

792
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,480
don't like the way you're doing this you

793
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,440
know it's like I'm not involved in any

794
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,519
way you're completely

795
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,400
independent you're you're basically

796
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,639
turning straw into gold here how are you

797
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,960
doing this and it kind of upset him in a

798
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:49,920
way because it upended the supply chain

799
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,318
uh you didn't have to go to Colombia to

800
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,880
get it you know and you didn't have to

801
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:55,599
go you could do it and you know and he

802
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,519
says and he started making all these

803
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,119
derisive comments like well well Dell

804
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:03,000
how many mushrooms can you pick you know

805
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,160
like I I didn't tell him you know I can

806
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,159
get an army of people to pick mushrooms

807
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,639
but he he he he started making all these

808
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,838
derisive comments he say I don't like

809
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,400
the way you're doing this but I'll sell

810
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:16,239
them for you and here here's the cash

811
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,800
and I I charged I charged 800 bucks a

812
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,078
pound you know 50 bucks an ounce uh

813
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,760
that's how much he charged or that's how

814
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:24,720
much you charged that's what that's the

815
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,079
wholesale price that's what I charged

816
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,639
wow and and just to put this in

817
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:34,079
perspective what year was was this

818
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:37,039
in um this was like 1974 75 okay okay

819
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,839
and and you know today you know pounds

820
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:44,440
of mushrooms are maybe like $500 on like

821
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:46,039
the absolute highend right so like $800

822
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,240
a pound in

823
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:49,759
1971 I mean we'll have to do some

824
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,559
calculations and see how I'm GNA

825
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,160
actually Google it like how much how

826
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:59,440
much is $800

827
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:59,440
today how much is $800

828
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,079
you know cuz that sounds like a

829
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,440
ridiculous

830
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,200
number I I just figured I don't know 50

831
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,559
Buck I mean it's just I was throwing

832
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:14,759
darts at a dart board I had no idea how

833
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:20,838
to how to price them

834
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,839
6,235 a pound yeah well that's

835
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,240
fair he's like I'll take it yeah so you

836
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,680
know I'm selling these things in

837
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,318
how how did people have enough money to

838
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:35,159
buy that I mean like that that seems

839
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:38,838
like I mean I'm glad you got it but like

840
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:40,519
that's only $50 that's I think your

841
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:44,400
calculations may be a little bit

842
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:48,719
deceiving because TI sticks retail 2 and

843
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:53,400
a half grams tie stick was

844
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:56,118
$25 so these were Exotics Gabby you know

845
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,880
yeah but was it like just for the rich

846
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,720
you know like how are hippies trip on

847
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,039
[ __ ] that cost that much H an ounce of

848
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,279
Colombian was about 40

849
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,960
bucks you know and that was somewhere

850
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:13,240
above Mexican but not quite as good as

851
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:17,039
thawe uh you know Mexican 30 bucks an

852
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:20,519
ounce somewhere in that range 25 bucks

853
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:23,318
an ounce for Lamb's bread from Jamaica

854
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:26,679
you know so it did kind of fit in the

855
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:28,800
range I thought um how many doses let's

856
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:31,399
see you know we we kind of consider

857
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,720
three grams to be a whopping pretty good

858
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,760
dose of mushrooms today so you know I

859
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:40,000
got 28 grams in there you know there's

860
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,200
quite a few doses for 50 bucks Gabby I

861
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,119
think it works out to five bucks a dose

862
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:47,279
you know it's not LSD which was around a

863
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:48,920
dollar a dose but you couldn't get LSD

864
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,960
because the major Supply chains have

865
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,358
been disrupted by the DEA so all of a

866
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,039
sudden Here Comes This natural product

867
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,480
that you're absolutely sure it is what

868
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,000
it is cuz look at it it is

869
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,119
it's not a white powder that you could

870
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,719
deceive someone with it's it's the

871
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:07,960
natural product so 50 bucks everybody

872
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,199
was paying it it was no problem so I I

873
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,159
think they were going out the door at

874
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:18,159
about a thousand uh

875
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:21,799
retail so uh you know I I sold what I

876
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:23,719
had to DL and then I realized this guy's

877
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,359
going to be hard to work with but I knew

878
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:29,559
another guy uh his name was Richard and

879
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,639
and he lived out in iness you know out

880
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:34,639
near Point rays and he was from Red Hook

881
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:38,400
in Brooklyn you know all my connects

882
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:40,279
were from New York uh and because they

883
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,280
know how to manage business let's face

884
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,280
it you know and he had a thriving

885
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:49,599
business shipping weed from California

886
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:53,359
uh to New York and uh I showed them to

887
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:57,559
him and he's like he was like a very

888
00:40:53,358 --> 00:41:00,239
well organized solid businessman and he

889
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:02,639
took one look and he says I will take

890
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:06,279
every pound you can

891
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:09,679
produce so with that mandate I I decided

892
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Well Sebastapol as nice as it is with

893
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,399
its 2 three acre Parcels here it's not

894
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,680
going to be what I need to create a

895
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,920
commercial operation I'm going to have

896
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:22,239
to get way further out and I'd already I

897
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,599
I grew a little weed in the yard next to

898
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,199
where I was doing the mushrooms cuz heck

899
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:29,800
I'm in Sebastapol I might as well grow a

900
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:32,639
little weed uh and the neighbor kids

901
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,280
came over and grabbed some branches so I

902
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,879
knew my security was less than ideal uh

903
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,560
so I decided Well I'm just going to have

904
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,160
to get further out so I decided I'm just

905
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,960
going to drive up Highway one and you

906
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:47,318
know find a good place and I just kept

907
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,639
driving and driving and the everything

908
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:52,559
became more Rural and wild and you know

909
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,719
I I went through SE Ranch and I crossed

910
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:58,279
the guala river into guala and I'm oh

911
00:41:55,719 --> 00:42:01,799
man this is a really funky little Berg

912
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:04,880
here this looks like the spot you know

913
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,240
and so I I started hanging around trying

914
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,880
to find a rental and I found this guy

915
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:13,598
had a log cabin for rent and it had out

916
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,680
buildings that were you know really

917
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,760
sheetrocked garages that were just

918
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,639
perfect uh for a an indoor growroom

919
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,960
because I had resolved at that point

920
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:25,838
it's time to take this inside so I can

921
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,159
control all the environmental variables

922
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:31,558
that I can't do outside you know I I'm I

923
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,920
I had been reading enough at that point

924
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:36,160
about mushroom growing that I knew kind

925
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,960
of what the parameters were what the

926
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:42,039
environmental controls were and I was

927
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:44,720
like okay let's let's step this up so I

928
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:48,199
converted these garages into uh one

929
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:51,799
second yeah one second you said that you

930
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:53,399
were reading on growing mushrooms but

931
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,519
were you reading on growing regular

932
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,280
mushrooms yes pelic ones because yes I

933
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,239
was reading on growing regular mushrooms

934
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,519
cuz I figured out these are what are

935
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:05,199
called coprophilic mushrooms they grow

936
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:09,800
on on

937
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:11,399
manure so I reasoned that the

938
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,519
conventional mushrooms which also grow

939
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,599
on manure would probably have the same

940
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:21,000
nutritional requirements and cultivation

941
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:23,160
would not be a lot different so I used

942
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,079
that information and there were some

943
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:27,358
books out there I found this one that

944
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,880
was really good called mushroom growing

945
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:32,719
today and it was by this English guy who

946
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,680
was you know sort of one of these

947
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,919
English Country Gentlemen growing

948
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,159
mushrooms you know in the countryside

949
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,960
and I I fancied myself kind of like that

950
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:45,558
I'm you know like a a a boutique Farmer

951
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,318
in the countryside growing mushrooms at

952
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:51,839
a small scale like this and you know

953
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:54,000
that book was super instructive uh and

954
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,358
so I started converting these garages

955
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,880
and I made turn one of the bedrooms in

956
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:01,679
this place into to a lab and you know I

957
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,119
started growing really

958
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:08,039
successfully and I took the first

959
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,000
batches I had like uh you know I think I

960
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:12,440
had about 200 lb out of my first harvest

961
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,800
and I took that

962
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,119
to uh Richard in iness he was like cash

963
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,920
here you go and that just Fu that fueled

964
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,519
the fire because he sent that back east

965
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,039
and people went nuts they're all well we

966
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,079
got to get more of these

967
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,838
and so I I said well you know what I got

968
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,760
to find something that's even large a

969
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:37,558
larger commercial operation I need to

970
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,680
even get more remote and more you know

971
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,200
uh more

972
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:44,960
infrastructure and I had I was in the

973
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:48,558
feed store and there was this guy uh and

974
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,358
uh he had these turkey barns in Point

975
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:54,640
Arena didn't have a crazy nickname like

976
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:57,119
Johnny two sticks and no no what all the

977
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,078
guys on the on the sales side had those

978
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,680
names you know and we'll get to that

979
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:05,079

1022
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:05,000
was way you know super remote out it

1023
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:08,480
went up this gated Road uh that I could

1024
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,920
completely control access to and uh I

1025
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:15,199
called up my buddy Cowboy Scott uh and

1026
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,760
uh he was uh from the construction

1027
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,439
industry in Southern

1028
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,480
California and meanwhile I'm going to

1029
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,559
graduate school and I'm doing all this

1030
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,199
work on the side you know and so I

1031
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:29,559
called up Cowboy Scott and I said this

1032
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,879
is the guy I need to ramrod this this

1033
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,559
job uh he was from the construction

1034
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,880
industry and he he'd run huge Crews and

1035
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,920
he says you know look I I've got I I

1036
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,960
know the team that I can bring for this

1037
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,680
and he brought his brother-in-law and

1038
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:48,039
all these people up there and just

1039
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:50,679
transformed those barns into mushroom

1040
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:52,960
growing into a mushroom growing facility

1041
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:55,039
with environmental controls with Heating

1042
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,280
and Cooling and all this stuff and he

1043
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,159
put out a lot of the money and you know

1044
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,800
I kind of took him on as a partner not a

1045
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:05,118
full partner but like as a kind of

1046
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,800
partner mostly uh you know he brought

1047
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,559
all these other people and then the

1048
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,160
other thing that he that was super cool

1049
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,240
is he did grow a little weed and he knew

1050
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:15,000
these

1051
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,598
Vietnamese uh families who would do the

1052
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,880
trimming and that's who he said let's

1053
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,318
use these guys to to do all the picking

1054
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:27,440
and harvesting and packaging and so we

1055
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:29,920
had a crew making compost and eventually

1056
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,119
I actually got Machinery to do the

1057
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,880
compost and that was inside one of the

1058
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:37,559
Barns and then the compost with

1059
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:41,358
forklifts and boxes would be distributed

1060
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:44,599
to the other Barns and so I had this

1061
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:47,480
fullon commercial mushroom farm going

1062
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:51,000
this is still mid to late 70s

1063
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:54,358
yeah and suddenly we're producing

1064
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,318
thousands of pounds of mushrooms

1065
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:58,159
literally and drying them and the drying

1066
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:01,199
operation now is expanded I've got

1067
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:04,039
Forest air heaters and cabinets and

1068
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,639
shelves and racks and just tons of

1069
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:08,679
mushrooms are getting processed out of

1070
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:09,759
this facility and you know I get a call

1071
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,598

1074
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:23,199
mushrooms and I had these U-Haul boxes

1075
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:26,399
uh you know the dish pack U-Haul boxes I

1076
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:29,598
could put exactly 50 lbs in each one of

1077
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,358
those box boxes so filled up you know

1078
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,280
all these boxes put them into a U-Haul

1079
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:37,440
and all I had to do was successfully

1080
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:41,200
drive down the coast and to to point

1081
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,440
Rays to iness with these boxes and boxes

1082
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:46,598
of mushrooms 4,000 pounds now was

1083
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,679

1084
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:50,440

1085
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:52,679
you know you've got all this

1086
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,679
psychedelics I'm like were you nervous

1087
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:58,519
or or you just I was scared out of my

1088
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:01,598

you with like another set of packing in

1090
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,838
front of all the boxes or was it just

1091
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:08,798
straight up no you couldn't do that

1092
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:10,679
because you couldn't do that because

1093
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:13,519
there was too many mushrooms so it was

1094
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:17,440
like boxes right to the door you open

1095
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:21,358
the door there'd be boxes there um and

1096
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:24,480
so I I I got this allpack you know what

1097
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,000
that reminds me of um back in the day in

1098
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,480
Willets it's not it's not like this

1099
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,719
anymore back in the day in Willets

1100
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,119
people would Harvest their weed like

1101
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,199
they felt the heat was coming or

1102
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:37,280
something and they' have all their weed

1103
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:38,639
in the back of the pickup truck like and

1104
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,920
like people would literally drive down

1105
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,358
the highway and you'd see [ __ ] weed

1106
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,760
like coming out the back of that pickup

1107
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:46,318
truck but they they were making an exit

1108
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,680
yeah and and a lot of times it wasn't

1109
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,279
dry yet it was just harvested pull it up

1110
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:54,598
throw it in the back and we'll dry it

1111
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:56,480
later you know um and so uh I had

1112
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,039
figured you know look I just went all

1113
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,760
the this trouble you wouldn't believe

1114
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,318
this thing was working like a Swiss

1115
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:05,000
watch you know over here we had the crew

1116
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:08,880
making compost here we got these

1117
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,679
Vietnamese families uh you know didn't

1118
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,079
blink about the work they're they're

1119
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:17,000
fine with 247 picking and over here

1120
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,519
we've got the packaging it was amazing

1121
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and so I didn't want you know the last

1122
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,880
minute to have this you know to to get

1123
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,159
it seized or you know so that ride down

1124
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,599
the coast was very scary

1125
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:32,639
you know so I get to Richard and he says

1126
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:36,079
okay come meet me at my office in point

1127
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:38,480
rays and he passes me a suitcase with

1128
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,798
millions and millions of dollars I mean

1129
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:45,480
two suitcases actually and and and I had

1130
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:48,639
people to pay you know obviously but

1131
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:52,760
there was significant profit

1132
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:56,078
there and so uh I was off to the races

1133
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:58,240
at that point and continued to do the

1134
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,798
commercial mushroom growing for quite

1135
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:03,000
some time after that what started

1136
00:51:59,798 --> 00:52:05,480
happening was competitors emerged and

1137
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,079
then there was kind of a price War but

1138
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:12,240
at that point I was so far ahead it like

1139
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:16,160
didn't really even matter you know and

1140
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:18,118
at this time I should say also the

1141
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:21,399
cultural Zeitgeist was beginning to

1142
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:25,200
change a little bit you know Reagan came

1143
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:28,720
into office and he was like you know the

1144
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:31,558
drug war and fancy just say no and all

1145
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:34,358
that stuff and people you know interest

1146
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:38,200
in psychedelic started falling off kind

1147
00:52:34,358 --> 00:52:41,000
of fell off a cliff really and my demand

1148
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:44,199
started really decreasing people wanted

1149
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,960
cocaine you know all of a sudden uh it

1150
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:49,358
was exemplified by I don't know you've

1151
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,280
seen that movie Gordon gecko greed is

1152
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,960
good it was Wall Street you know and

1153
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,960
psychedelics were looked at as kind of

1154
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,880
an Indulgence you know like a like a

1155
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,960
waste of time you know what we want to

1156
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,798
do is is make money in business you know

1157
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:07,639
and so cocaine emerged as the drug of

1158
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:11,119
choice and people had less and less use

1159
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:13,000
for mushrooms so that was interesting

1160
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,920
but I had already started another hobby

1161
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,480
at that

1162
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,159
point

1163
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,480
cannabis I was uh starting to grow

1164
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:23,199
cannabis indoors the first indoor grows

1165
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,480
you know I had these great

1166
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:28,239
facilities uh and so I I thought well

1167
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,480
I'm going to experiment with genetics uh

1168
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,358
I can you describe your first indor grow

1169
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,119
just

1170
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:37,920
in that's funny because because of the

1171
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:41,240
era lighting and stuff I'm the um there

1172
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,599
was a magazine this is preh high I know

1173
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:46,959
High Times was happening but High Times

1174
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:49,640
was a glossy commercial it wasn't really

1175
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,440
for Growers you know it wasn't uh the

1176
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:53,400
nuts and bolts of growing another

1177
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:58,000
magazine came out that was printed like

1178
00:53:53,400 --> 00:54:01,400
on newsprint called sensia tips out of

1179
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,440
Eugene out of Eugene uh Tom Alexander

1180
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,519
I'm still friends with him I'm hoping I

1181
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,599
can get him on the show I've been

1182
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:09,798
messaging him yeah he's a good friend of

1183
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,240
mine actually and I I went up to Eugene

1184
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:13,880
you know I'm reading this and I'm like

1185
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:16,759
oh street lights we got to use street

1186
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,960
lights in inside and in those days they

1187
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,880
didn't have like pre-made little you

1188
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,760
know ballasts and everything all

1189
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,000
pre-made for you had to build it

1190
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,760
yourself from scratch so I was building

1191
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,559
it on plywood stuff like little plywood

1192
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,119
boxes and stuff and you become an expert

1193
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:37,319
at electrical wiring yourself at this

1194
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:40,960
point really I can wire Hoover Dam if I

1195
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:44,119
had to uh you know I I've gained so much

1196
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:48,240
knowledge about wiring uh Electrical uh

1197
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:51,440
environment so I went up to Eugene uh to

1198
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:54,558
his grow store uh Blue Moon I think it

1199
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:57,079
was called and this guy's just out there

1200
00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:00,798
selling these lights and you this is how

1201
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:03,119
you grow cannabis indoors and uh you

1202
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,280
know it seemed kind of ballsy you know

1203
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,119
in a way you know he's got a whole store

1204
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,359
selling this so I walk in and I I buy

1205
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,720
like 40

1206
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:13,159
lights and that was the biggest purchase

1207
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:16,480
he'd seen at that point he was like oh

1208
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:18,279
my God let me help you we became friends

1209
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,599
uh what

1210
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,599
this like

1211
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:29,200
1979 I think like 1979 1978 9 how much

1212
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,639
were they selling the lights for do you

1213
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:38,038
remember oh gosh it was pretty cheap

1214
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:42,159
like 120 bucks the you know everybody at

1215
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:46,400
that time thought okay you veg under

1216
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:47,920
halides and then you flour under sodiums

1217
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,480
and then somebody figured out well you

1218
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,838
could just use the sodiums the whole

1219
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,358
time it doesn't you know it's not that

1220
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:57,440
much different you know and so the

1221
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:59,358
sodiums were more expensive I can't they

1222
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,559
they were a little more pricey I think

1223
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:05,119
maybe in the $200 range something like

1224
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:06,720
that so I get my 40 lights

1225
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:11,880
wat

1226
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:13,598
um gosh th Watts no yeah th000 Watts you

1227
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,519
sure yeah

1228
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,920
positive yeah no we're we're not messing

1229
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:22,400
around Gabby you know we're growing some

1230
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,079
weed okay I know I know I know you wer

1231
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,440
messing around but I didn't know that

1232
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,359
the street lights were a th000 Watts

1233
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,519
yeah you know for sure when I when I

1234
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:33,519
first started going to the grow store

1235
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:35,199
and I'll give a little uh not a plug cuz

1236
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,679
it's not there anymore but Ross East

1237
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,519
Coast Hydroponics the biggest he had was

1238
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:42,838
a 430 watt

1239
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:45,280
light oh no we we had thousands you know

1240
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:48,480
I mean so anyway let me just tell you my

1241
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,960
first grow I pack all these lights in I

1242
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,079
didn't understand that heat is not

1243
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,400
necessarily beneficial to the grow I

1244
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:58,599
thought you know and then I'd been

1245
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:01,400
reading articles about CO2 so I was like

1246
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:03,599
okay tips yeah yeah I'm going to jack

1247
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,798
this up with CO2 we're going to we're

1248
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,160
going to really have a huge production

1249
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:10,239
and I seal the room up and the heat goes

1250
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:13,798
through the ceiling I thought ah no

1251
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:15,358
problem that's like you know tropical

1252
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:18,079
Zone you know it's not going to hurt

1253
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:19,798
anything and the plants just like were

1254
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:24,280
they produced these flowers that were

1255
00:57:19,798 --> 00:57:26,559
like one long stock with a Kix here Kix

1256
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,680
here a Kix here a Kix here they were

1257
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,519
just so stretched out they were trying

1258
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:36,239
to survive from the amount of heat that

1259
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:38,719
was in that room uh and I was uh you

1260
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:41,199
know that it was an interesting actual

1261
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:43,399
scientific experiment because you found

1262
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:46,239
out that cannabis goes to Great Lengths

1263
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,318
to keep the sex cells cool and if it has

1264
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:52,279
to it will create these long stretched

1265
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:55,599
branches just to keep keep it cool for

1266
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:57,880
survival purposes but if it's cold and

1267
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,880
and this is what was funny I had one

1268
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:04,039
room that I didn't have any heat in it

1269
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:07,920
was ice cold up you know on the coast

1270
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:10,680
and those buds came out beautiful right

1271
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,400
gorgeous and I was like well I guess you

1272
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:16,598
got to pay attention to the heat uh and

1273
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,838
so I started working from that

1274
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:22,079
perspective and things started coming

1275
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:24,358
out really good really really well and I

1276
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,440
knew I had been introduced there was a

1277
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:30,199
guy who lived on the coast great guy

1278

1287
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,239

Strain Hunters you're right exactly and

1299
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,880
arjan and I become really good friends

1300
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,280
and he loves the operation I have going

1301
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,760
and so we start doing these genetics

1302
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,960
exchanges I'm working with what is

1303
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,160
available in mesino there was a guy

1304
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:50,440
named mean Jean green who had uh you

1305
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:53,558
know some serious genetics at that time

1306
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:57,679
uh but you know we're seeing Early Skunk

1307
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:59,839
varieties uh quite unique uh and he came

1308
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:02,440
up with you know he's famous for haze

1309
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:05,759
varieties uh and some really interesting

1310
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:08,920
sativas he hits me up and says look I've

1311
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,599
got this is the this is the best strains

1312
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,559
I've ever had I want you to kind of

1313
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,119
cross them with what you've got and

1314
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:19,640
let's let's produce some really uh

1315
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:23,480
unique strains and so I started doing

1316
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:25,838
that and I had some outside Growers who

1317
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,159
would you know would seed huge amounts

1318
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:30,880
of crops so I'm I'm ending up with

1319
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:34,960
pounds and pounds and pounds of seeds uh

1320
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:38,358
over a period of time and These Guys

1321
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,760
these these varieties are unbelievable I

1322
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:44,078
wish I had them today they were

1323
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:48,760
remarkable this whole one branch of it

1324
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:50,599
was all citrus like lemon so lemony it

1325
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:54,599
was like someone put a lemon right under

1326
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:57,440
your nose orange just like an orange and

1327
01:00:54,599 --> 01:01:00,519
then there was this really really skunk

1328
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,480
dies branch and they they were kind of

1329
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:04,480
like expressed in those two different

1330
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:10,240
ways they were either this really Citrus

1331
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:14,599
form or they were this incredible dies

1332
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:18,279
Inda uh uh group and so I was just I

1333
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:20,880
mean these were really great I I mean

1334
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,880
even by today's standards I would say

1335
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,960
year was

1336
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:28,318
this um this was like 1979 1980

1337
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,199
so still right around the first year

1338
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:34,798
when you were setting up to grow yeah

1339
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:37,399
yeah and so uh I am collecting all these

1340
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:40,318
seeds and you know at the same time

1341
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,960
where is uh cannabis being

1342
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:46,318
grown it's being grown in Mexico you

1343
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,039
know if you want a commercial grow you

1344
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:49,880
either go out into the woods and do this

1345
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:51,760
gorilla thing which never made sense to

1346
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,838
me because they got helicopters and if

1347
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,880
you get caught you know they're throwing

1348
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:59,038
away the key you know cuz at that time

1349
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,559
you know cannabis wasn't that distant

1350
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:05,079
from heroin uh the way they looked at it

1351
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:08,240
uh so it was a very serious offense it

1352
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:09,680
was a major felony uh and so that never

1353
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:12,318
made sense to me oh I'm going to go out

1354
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:13,960
and risk a giant crop outside and

1355
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:15,960
hopefully it gets through hopefully the

1356
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,199
helicopters don't find it so I started

1357
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,358
thinking where can I grow weed

1358
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:22,879
commercially at scale because I want to

1359
01:02:20,358 --> 01:02:26,078
see these varieties grown at scale and I

1360
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:30,200
had this friend who was smuggling

1361
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:33,440
from Mexico on the border in El Paso uh

1362
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:35,759
El Paso and Warz being sister cities

1363
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:38,760
that are separated by a bridge over the

1364
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,480
Rio Grand and I actually knew him

1365
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:44,920
through this guy named

1366
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:48,480
Lloyd uh he was a surfer he had a uh

1367
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:51,358
Boutique clothing store in lagona Beach

1368
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:54,719
called visions and it sold all these

1369
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:59,078
like white flowing hippie clothes you

1370
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:02,358
know uh uh it was really classic for the

1371
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:05,839
time and down the street from that was

1372
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:09,000
uh the Brotherhood of Eternal loves head

1373
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:10,599
shop uh and you you would go in there it

1374
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,519
was like the coolest place because they

1375
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:15,359
had all this stuff oriented to

1376
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:20,079
psychedelia in there and next door to it

1377
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:22,798
was a record store that sold only um

1378
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:25,240
bootleg albums that's all they sold

1379
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:27,838
nothing else so you go in there Dylan on

1380
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:30,479
the aisle of white Janice Joplin

1381
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,400
performing it you know it was so cool i'

1382
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,358
go in there and grab all these great

1383
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,680
albums that you know they were weren't

1384
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:40,880
great quality but they were really cool

1385
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:45,278
concerts uh so he was kind of in the

1386
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:48,798
middle of that and he knew my friend I'm

1387
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:50,358
going to use the fake name here Brian uh

1388
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:52,199
in El Paso and that's where he was

1389
01:03:50,358 --> 01:03:54,159
getting the weed from this guy would

1390
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:56,598
ship weed out to California and Lloyd

1391
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:59,838
would sell it and he was and they were

1392
01:03:56,599 --> 01:04:03,599
doing tons of weed

1393
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:06,719
tons uh and so the entire weed scene was

1394
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:09,720
being fueled by these Mexican varieties

1395
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,879
which were very poor quality you know

1396
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:14,118
sticks

1397
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:17,278
stems not really brick weed but you know

1398
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:19,880
just not con ofur Grade weed compared to

1399
01:04:17,278 --> 01:04:22,000
what we could grow you know indoors or

1400
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,838
or even outdoors in

1401
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,159
California and so I I don't know how it

1402
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:28,838
happened but I just got this idea I'm

1403
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:32,118
going to pitch to this

1404
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:34,400
guy you know I pitched it to Lloyd first

1405
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:37,559
and I said look

1406
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,318
um what if we gave these genetics or

1407
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:42,760
made these genetics available to the

1408
01:04:39,318 --> 01:04:45,719
Mexican cartels that are growing in

1409
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:49,160
Mexico we could grow this at commercial

1410
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:50,879
scale and the quality would benefit

1411
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:52,798
everybody it would benefit the Mexicans

1412
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,838
they'd get a higher price it would

1413
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:57,880
benefit the consumers because we'd get

1414
01:04:54,838 --> 01:05:00,358
quality product this is a win-win for

1415
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,519
everybody so Lloyd thought about that

1416
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:02,880
and he's said you know what this is a

1417
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:06,960
great idea I want to pitch it to my

1418
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,599
buddy in El Paso so he said get some

1419
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,798
samples of your

1420
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:14,640
weed and let's fly down to El Paso and

1421
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:17,038
Pitch this to the

1422
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:20,759
cartels and at this point Lloyd just

1423
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:23,520
kind of handed me off to Brian and Brian

1424
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,799
and I became the best of friends and

1425
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:31,480
he's actually my best one of my best

1426
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:34,119
friends to this day and uh so we go I I

1427
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:36,358
I fly down to El Paso and I'm looking

1428
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:39,358
out the window of the plane as we're

1429
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:41,199
flying down and it looks like this scrub

1430
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:43,880
brush that you'd see in you know

1431
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:45,399
California deserts but there's all these

1432
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,599
little roads cut through there and I

1433
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,039
start thinking man you could just easily

1434
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,640
get lost and that's how they do this

1435
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:54,000
they smuggle it across the border a

1436
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:56,440
variety of ways either in backpacks or

1437
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,760
in cards where they jet across cross

1438
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,639
they have all these different methods

1439
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,920
and just looking at the plane I began to

1440
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:05,679
see oh wow this is really interesting

1441
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:09,318
how they can do this and

1442
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:12,199
so and his wife uh I'm going to use a

1443
01:06:09,318 --> 01:06:15,440
fake name Malia picked me up at the

1444
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:20,358
airport she's driving a classically

1445
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:22,519
restored 1960 Cadillac convertible pink

1446
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:25,880
with a white interior and they've

1447
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:27,679
transformed this car into a the most

1448
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:29,278
advanced sound system I've ever seen in

1449
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:31,199
my life it's like being in a concert

1450
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:33,400
hall and she has speakers hidden in

1451
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,879
every vent you can't see a speaker

1452
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,358
anywhere but we get in the car and it's

1453
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,559
just like rock and roll City and we're

1454
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:42,239
driving with a top down and I've got

1455
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:45,839
some samples with me that I matched

1456
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:50,159
smuggle on the pain I I did sealed bags

1457
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:52,920
foil bags and uh no smell right smuggled

1458

down uh with Brian and he says okay I've

1521
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,440
made some arrangements we're going to

1522
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,798
make a pitch today to the head of the

1523
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:52,479
Warz

1524
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:55,560
cartel a guy named graus graus in

1525
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:57,158
Spanish means mophead kind of I mean

1526
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,560
that's the best translation I can come

1527
01:09:57,158 --> 01:10:03,799
up with uh and he had these sort of

1528
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:06,159
Reggae styled locks you know that

1529
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,560
warranted the nickname and he had

1530
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:11,479
started out as a uh he he' gone to

1531
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,159
school in the United States sold cars

1532
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:16,359
had some business education in the

1533
01:10:13,158 --> 01:10:20,279
United States and went back to Warz and

1534
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:22,639
became the cartel Kingpin now you want

1535
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:25,960
to fully understand that the person who

1536
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:28,360
they put in that position behind them

1537
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:30,399
are the Mexican Government the highest

1538
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:33,119
levels of the Mexican Government the

1539
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:36,439
richest families in Mexico and they put

1540
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:40,238
this person in place who acts as an

1541
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:42,039
intermediary and is sort of easy easily

1542
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:44,839
Expendable if there's any kind of

1543
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:47,399
trouble you know they put another guy

1544
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:50,520
who interfaces with the gringos and does

1545
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:54,119
the major brokering to those people uh

1546
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:56,560
on the border and so it's a job where

1547
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:59,880
you're Expendable but at this point he

1548
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:03,120
his wealth is increasing and he is

1549
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:06,760
driving around town in bulletproof

1550
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:10,158
rolls-royces and building highrise

1551
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,960
apartments and clubs in downtown Warz

1552
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:14,599
and at this time you know now we know

1553
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,880
Warz is kind of the murder capital of

1554
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,840
the world and people getting disappeared

1555
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:21,560
and all this cartel violence at that

1556
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,880
point I should say and the reason I

1557
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,280
wasn't totally afraid to do this kind of

1558
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:28,440
stuff is that cartels operated

1559
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:32,158
differently they operated on principles

1560
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:35,158
of honor and you know they would rather

1561
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:38,119
bribe you than kill you and

1562
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:40,359
so they you know killing someone was a

1563
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:44,000
big deal at this time it wasn't the

1564
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:48,880
bloody Enterprise that it later became

1565
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:50,399
uh so you know he's establishing himself

1566
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,480
and you know these guys one of the

1567
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:56,759
things I learned was they love quarter

1568
01:11:52,479 --> 01:12:01,279
horse racing and so on the Feast of s

1569
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:03,719
Santa ventur uh the Feast of buav

1570
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:06,079
Ventura that's what it was they took

1571
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:09,480
over this town and they had these cartel

1572
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:12,000
quarter horse races and uh he bet a

1573
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:14,839
million dollars on his horse to win and

1574
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,520
he lost and he Shrugged it off you know

1575
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:21,560
like no big deal um and you know he he

1576
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:25,600
was an upand cominging figure so we're

1577
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:29,480

01:19:34,679 --> 01:19:38,719

1740
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:01,079
looking and he he's sitting down his

1741
01:19:59,479 --> 01:20:03,039
desk with his feet up and he reaches

1742
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:06,079
into his shirt pocket and he pulls out a

1743
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:08,880
little baggie and it's filled with base

1744
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:11,399
Coke base and he pours it out on the

1745
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:14,920
table and he takes out a package of

1746
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:17,439
Marboro cigarettes and carefully undoes

1747
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,359
the cigarettes takes the tobacco out

1748
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:21,359
right so it's just like a little flaccid

1749
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:23,439
cigarette and he mixes the tobacco with

1750
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:27,599
the base and he starts putting it

1751
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:30,479
stuffing it back into the uh maros right

1752
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,120
then he sit back and lights up and he's

1753
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:33,439
just smoking cigarette after cigarette

1754
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:37,479
of this and I'm like how is this guy

1755
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:39,279
even mildly coherent you know he's just

1756
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:43,559
smoking all this base while we're having

1757
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:47,559
this chat right anyway he says

1758
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:50,039
okay I like what you've got you know

1759
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:52,400
tell me about it how would this work I

1760
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:55,039
said well I have seeds and there's also

1761
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:58,679
a new process called cloning that you

1762
01:20:55,039 --> 01:21:01,439
know we can use to even accelerate uh

1763
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:03,239
the amount of of viable plants that we

1764
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,879
have and he oh yeah tell me about that

1765
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:09,399
and so I kind of tell him about that and

1766
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:11,760
so you know as time goes on during the

1767
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:15,559
discussion he starts becoming convinced

1768
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:17,159
yeah this is a great idea and he goes

1769
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:19,760
over to a file cabinet and pulls the

1770
01:21:17,158 --> 01:21:22,198
file cabinet open takes a file folder

1771
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,560
out he says let me show you where you're

1772
01:21:22,198 --> 01:21:27,158
going to be growing he lays these

1773
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:30,320
polaroid pictures out on the table and I

1774
01:21:27,158 --> 01:21:34,719
look at these Polaroids and vast lime

1775
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:37,679
green fields on wh desert sand just as

1776
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:39,679
far as the eye can see you know just

1777
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:43,560
huge giant

1778
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:45,319
grows and uh I'm thinking uh Oho wow

1779
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:47,880
this is incredible one of the things I

1780
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:51,799
noticed in the photographs is there's

1781
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:54,639
Mexican Army guarding these fields

1782
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:57,159
Mexican Army half tracks Mexican Army

1783
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:58,960
helicopter Mexican Army you know

1784
01:21:57,158 --> 01:22:00,399
Soldiers with machine guns guarding

1785
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:04,239
these fields and I'm

1786
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:09,079
like uh what the hell is going on you

1787
01:22:04,238 --> 01:22:11,479
know and I I say to him kesto he say ah

1788
01:22:09,079 --> 01:22:15,279
we buy the Army we have a relationship

1789
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:17,879
with the Minister of Defense uh and he

1790
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:20,479
takes out our competitor fields and we

1791
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:24,159
pay him and he takes care of our Fields

1792
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:26,759
so I'm like wow this is like wired to

1793
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:30,119
the high highest levels of government

1794
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:32,119
and uh you know that's why to some

1795
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:33,920
extent getting the story out there I

1796
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:36,158
don't know if the Mexican Government

1797
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:41,319
would look favorably on me telling this

1798
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:44,279
story but it's true uh so he says okay

1799
01:22:41,319 --> 01:22:47,319
this is the story is from 50 years ago

1800
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:48,840
already or 40 years ago fair enough

1801
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:51,439
stuff has come out I I don't think

1802
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:55,239
anyone in current um government is going

1803
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:56,359
to care so uh he says okay this is how

1804
01:22:55,238 --> 01:22:59,039
it's going to work I'm going to give you

1805
01:22:56,359 --> 01:23:01,119
a percentage of the load I will be able

1806
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:04,760
to get it I will do all the crossing On

1807
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:07,000
the Border uh we will ship it to your

1808
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,600
markets in New York in commercial

1809
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,960
vehicles and to San Francisco you have

1810
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,840
markets in San Francisco and New York

1811
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:16,840
I'm kind of One-Stop shop I bring the

1812
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,000
genetics and I bring the market you know

1813
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,199
and so he says huh this is this is very

1814
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,920
good and he says I'll give you a

1815
01:23:20,198 --> 01:23:26,319
percentage and um just one thing bring

1816

samas I want those [ __ ] samas and he

1818
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,679
says you [ __ ] me on this and you work

1819
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:35,559
with anybody else I will cut your balls

1820
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:36,520
off and feed them to you he literally

1821
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:40,800
says

1822
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:43,880
that and so we drive away from this

1823
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,719
meeting and I think I've got it made

1824
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:48,319
this guy's going to handle everything

1825
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:51,079
all I got to do is impart some

1826
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:54,079
cultivation knowledge supervise the grow

1827
01:23:51,079 --> 01:23:55,920
and uh supply all the seeds and clones

1828
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:58,880
and set up a cloning operation this is

1829
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,840
going to be perfect uh turns out he

1830
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,159
wanted help with all aspects of his

1831
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,440
smuggling operation he's like I got I'm

1832
01:24:03,158 --> 01:24:06,719
having trouble you know I want to make

1833
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:09,279
sure it doesn't mold I got I want to

1834
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:11,760
make sure that you know there's no smell

1835
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:14,759
in the packaging and so I found these

1836
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:17,840
packaging machines you know for him uh

1837
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:20,480
this place in San Rafel does industrial

1838
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:23,639
uh you know sealed bagging you know and

1839
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:26,479
injects nitrogen into it you know was

1840
01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:30,359
unusual not so unusual now but injects

1841
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:32,919
nitrogen into it so you know it prevents

1842
01:24:30,359 --> 01:24:35,799
mold and I go away from this thinking

1843
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:39,158
man I have got it made you know and so

1844
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:40,279
we start scaling up and I start going

1845
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:44,479
over to

1846
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:46,319
Mexico and uh come to understand that

1847
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,079
these seeds and clones are going to the

1848
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:53,238
cartel's operation called Rancho

1849
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:56,399

says um we are receiving cocaine from

2220
01:41:58,359 --> 01:42:04,639
Colombia that is of very poor quality uh

2221
01:42:02,439 --> 01:42:07,759
and we need to process it into a much

2222
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:10,199
higher quality uh Senor gardo wants to

2223
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:13,199
create a facility to do this in

2224
01:42:10,198 --> 01:42:15,238
Durango uh in a very large scale

2225
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:18,079
facility is that something that you

2226
01:42:15,238 --> 01:42:20,198
could help us design uh build and you

2227
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:22,198
know show us how to

2228
01:42:20,198 --> 01:42:24,319
operate and you know I'm sitting there

2229
01:42:22,198 --> 01:42:25,960
thinking to myself

2230
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:28,158
I mean there Bas there's one other

2231
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:31,279
matter that Senor Gallardo would like

2232
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:32,638
your assistance with you know and all

2233
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:34,238
these thoughts are racing through my

2234
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:36,679
mind like I just came here to [ __ ]

2235
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:40,678
grow marijuana I I did not come here to

2236
01:42:36,679 --> 01:42:43,039
do this right and but I knew that Felix

2237
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:46,719
Gallardo was not someone who would take

2238
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:48,439
being turned down very well and so this

2239
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,439
was kind of my opportunity to kind of

2240
01:42:48,439 --> 01:42:53,319
close the deal on my

2241
01:42:50,439 --> 01:42:55,118
value and I thought to myself I could

2242
01:42:53,319 --> 01:42:57,519
walk away from the project before it

2243
01:42:55,118 --> 01:43:00,719
attracts attention I just show him how

2244
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:03,560
to you know put Sops in place and just

2245
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:06,439
set it all up so I stood up and I held

2246
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:07,800
out my hand I said seor Gallardo I'm at

2247
01:43:06,439 --> 01:43:13,519
your

2248
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:15,800
service and so then I built the largest

2249
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,520
cocaine reprocessing

2250
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:19,599
plant

2251
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:23,320
imaginable in

2252
01:43:19,599 --> 01:43:27,159
Tango and uh there's some great story

2253
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:30,439
there I learned a lot about cocaine and

2254
01:43:27,158 --> 01:43:34,319
the various species of Coca from which

2255
01:43:30,439 --> 01:43:37,319
the extract is derived uh there are only

2256
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:40,519
two of 17 species that are successfully

2257
01:43:37,319 --> 01:43:42,679
cultivated and uh there's one particular

2258
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:45,119
that is desirable because it has the

2259
01:43:42,679 --> 01:43:48,840
highest alkaloid content you I could go

2260
01:43:45,118 --> 01:43:52,519
into you know a real disquisition on

2261
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:54,880
Cocaine by botney at this point uh it's

2262
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:57,199
harvested by that for another podcast

2263
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,960
yeah yeah the thing is I don't want you

2264
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:02,759
to like speed through it you know like

2265
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:04,520
maybe just tell us the whole thing or or

2266
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:07,159
we'll have to save it for later you know

2267
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:09,719
yeah it's so interesting to me and I

2268
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:12,279
would love to tell you all about it uh

2269
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:14,880
but this facility he had selected was on

2270
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:16,559
the out skirts of Durango and several

2271
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:20,039
large industrial buildings that had a

2272
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:21,920
large messall multi-story building uh

2273
01:44:20,039 --> 01:44:23,760
that was the designated location for the

2274
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:25,960
commercial Laboratory

2275
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:28,920
and a small army of his most trusted

2276
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:31,079
employees provided security along with

2277
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:33,279
multiple payoffs to the Mexican Army

2278
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:36,599
police agencies

2279
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:39,479
politicians and uh Durango's located

2280
01:44:36,599 --> 01:44:42,119
it's the capital city of uh of the state

2281
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:46,519
of Durango and it's located in this

2282
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:50,158
Dusty dry region uh in the Sierra Madre

2283
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:52,880
accidental uh mountain range uh and it's

2284
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:53,839
it's beautiful area actually some of it

2285
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:57,560
uh

2286
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:59,800
and it has always been an area known for

2287
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:02,199
uh its resistance to

2288
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:04,159
Authority uh and perhaps that's why they

2289
01:45:02,198 --> 01:45:06,359
picked it you know it it has a long

2290
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:09,719
history in the Mexican War of

2291
01:45:06,359 --> 01:45:14,279
Independence uh you know there's uh you

2292
01:45:09,719 --> 01:45:16,319
know peruo Diaz and karanza had strong

2293
01:45:14,279 --> 01:45:20,679
ties revolutionary leaders had strong

2294
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:23,000
ties to them uh so when I saw the

2295
01:45:20,679 --> 01:45:24,480
laboratory that he proposed I made a

2296
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,520
huge list of everything I was going to

2297
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:28,399
need that he would get from his German

2298
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:30,199
suppliers and that's when I became

2299
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:32,279
acquainted with the fact that he had

2300
01:45:30,198 --> 01:45:34,399
these German suppliers kind of like in

2301
01:45:32,279 --> 01:45:37,238
Breaking Bad where they they showed

2302
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:39,439
these uh German suppliers he had all

2303
01:45:37,238 --> 01:45:41,439
these businesses that were Agricultural

2304
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:44,638
and whether you know it or not a lot of

2305
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:47,399
the same chemicals that are used uh are

2306
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:50,239
used to make pesticides the precursor

2307
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:53,198
chemicals so there was an easy process

2308
01:45:50,238 --> 01:45:55,000
of layering purchase of these chemicals

2309
01:45:53,198 --> 01:45:58,198
so that nobody could figure out what it

2310
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:00,639
was being used for uh so I started you

2311
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:03,319
know listing you know dozens of high

2312
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:06,679
volume Roto evaporators giant custom

2313
01:46:03,319 --> 01:46:11,000
glass vessels Grinders pulverizers

2314
01:46:06,679 --> 01:46:13,960
mixing tanks you know just commercial

2315
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,359
scale and I developed the operating

2316
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:18,000
procedures that would look at the

2317
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:20,039
product figure out you know what would

2318
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,359
be the next steps some of it had to be

2319
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:23,719
cleaned up before you could even

2320
01:46:21,359 --> 01:46:26,439
reconstitute it because eventually I I

2321
01:46:23,719 --> 01:46:29,439
would reconstitute it back into base and

2322
01:46:26,439 --> 01:46:32,598
then eventually the final product was

2323
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:36,279
essentially pharmaceutical uh there is

2324
01:46:32,599 --> 01:46:39,639
one thing I will tell you about um when

2325
01:46:36,279 --> 01:46:42,439
in the process you add hydrochloric acid

2326
01:46:39,639 --> 01:46:45,639
to precipitate the cocaine out of

2327
01:46:42,439 --> 01:46:48,799
solution and if you add it too quickly

2328
01:46:45,639 --> 01:46:50,840
it turns into a dull powder boom like

2329
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:54,360
that but if you

2330
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:56,079
swirl and I started doing like in Erland

2331
01:46:54,359 --> 01:46:59,399
Meer flasks to figure it out and then

2332
01:46:56,079 --> 01:47:01,679
scaled it to giant size but you swirl

2333
01:46:59,399 --> 01:47:04,079
the Erland Meer and you swirl the other

2334
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:07,000
Erland Meer with the acid solution in it

2335
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:10,960
and you slowly pour them together it

2336
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:14,118
turns into the most beautiful flake this

2337
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:16,920
iridescent snowflakes appear and they

2338
01:47:14,118 --> 01:47:19,880
layer up uh different from the dull

2339
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:22,679
Dusty powder if you just pour it in and

2340
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:24,520
the reaction takes place too quickly so

2341
01:47:22,679 --> 01:47:26,279
that was actually quite revolutionary

2342
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:29,280
and I set up these giant vessels that

2343
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:32,000
would titrate it in the acid solution

2344
01:47:29,279 --> 01:47:33,639
slowly enough to create this beautiful

2345
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,118
pharmaceutical grade

2346
01:47:33,639 --> 01:47:38,920
cocaine um so you know I hate doing a

2347
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:43,960
bad job

2348
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:45,560
so um you know this story has some

2349
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:47,840
twists and terms and we we've kind of

2350
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:51,960
started a thread here and I'll just take

2351
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:54,920
it to a certain place okay um while I'm

2352
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:56,359
there you know uh fumes everything there

2353
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:58,239
there's a couple of really funny things

2354
01:47:56,359 --> 01:48:02,639
that happened one thing is I had this

2355
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:04,638
guy working for me uh who he I kept

2356
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,520
telling there was a water heater and I

2357
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:08,639
said before we start anything turn the

2358
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:11,280
pilot light off on that water heater we

2359
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:13,520
can't have any flames in the lab clean

2360
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:16,000
up the glassware turn off the pilot

2361
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:19,000
light okay I don't even want it on in

2362
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,960
the same building uh and I had this

2363
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:25,719
chemical feed from upstairs and this guy

2364
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:28,279
had used tubing the wrong tubing to

2365
01:48:25,719 --> 01:48:32,239
construct it and it was tubing that

2366
01:48:28,279 --> 01:48:36,479
wasn't rated for acetone which I used as

2367
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:39,000
a solvent in part of the process and the

2368
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:43,198
tubing started swelling and getting

2369
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:46,960
bigger and of course the guy left the uh

2370
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:51,559
pilot light on and the tubing swelled

2371
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:54,599
into this giant uh expansion and the guy

2372
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:58,320
walks over there goes ksso and he pokes

2373
01:48:54,599 --> 01:49:02,159
it it explodes pours all the solvent out

2374
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:05,359
in the floor heads straight over to the

2375
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:08,279
uh the pilot light suddenly I've got

2376
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:11,000
giant flames in front of me uh you know

2377
01:49:08,279 --> 01:49:13,319
30 feet high in this giant industrial

2378
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,800
building it's connected

2379
01:49:13,319 --> 01:49:19,158
to hundreds of 55 gallon drums of

2380
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:22,199
solvent that are on the second floor

2381
01:49:19,158 --> 01:49:26,319
right and it's starting to burn up the

2382
01:49:22,198 --> 01:49:28,158
uh the tubing to the second floor I grab

2383
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:30,840
the first fire extinguisher I see I try

2384
01:49:28,158 --> 01:49:34,118
to put it out and the fire extinguisher

2385
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:36,000
doesn't work and I'm like he gets me and

2386
01:49:34,118 --> 01:49:38,039
we go outside he says man we just got to

2387
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,679
walk away you know just let the thing

2388
01:49:38,039 --> 01:49:43,359
blow up and I said nothing's blowing up

2389
01:49:40,679 --> 01:49:46,440
on my watch so I go back in there and

2390
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:49,319
this is what's really funny when I had

2391
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:52,238
been working with Alexander shulan when

2392
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:55,039
I had successfully done some synthesis

2393
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:57,439
process says he gave me this fire

2394
01:49:55,039 --> 01:49:59,960
extinguisher which was like this big 4ft

2395
01:49:57,439 --> 01:50:03,319
tall fire extinguisher he says this is

2396
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:05,239
your symbol of you having graduated you

2397
01:50:03,319 --> 01:50:07,880
are now an underground chemist and I

2398
01:50:05,238 --> 01:50:09,799
give this to you to have in all your

2399
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:13,079
underground chemistry labs and I brought

2400
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:15,560
the thing with me right and I had it

2401
01:50:13,079 --> 01:50:17,599
there sitting in a corner and it hadn't

2402
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:21,000
been used I hadn't even looked at it for

2403
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:23,440
years right and I saw it and here these

2404
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:26,279
Flames are getting out of control

2405
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:28,319
I went over pulled the pin on it turned

2406
01:50:26,279 --> 01:50:30,920
it toward the fire and the force of it

2407
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:32,759
was knocked me over almost the fire was

2408
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:36,840
out in

2409
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:39,920
seconds wow that's crazy the the guy who

2410
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:42,239
what so shulan saved my ass there uh the

2411
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:44,480
guy who was you know watching this

2412
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:46,039
disappeared into Durango I never saw him

2413
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:48,799
again CU he was just like what are the

2414
01:50:46,039 --> 01:50:51,599
repercussions from this I'm just leaving

2415
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:54,880
it messed up maybe you know a kilo of

2416
01:50:51,599 --> 01:51:00,409
Coke or something nothing serious uh in

2417
01:50:54,880 --> 01:51:02,319
the scheme of things uh so I'm in a uh a

2418
01:51:00,409 --> 01:51:06,519
[Music]

2419
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:09,118
um Pharmacy in Durango because I had a

2420
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:11,079
headache uh from everything that had

2421
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:13,439
happened and I'm looking at headache

2422
01:51:11,078 --> 01:51:18,359
tablets you can buy over the counter in

2423
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:19,678
Mexico and what I come across is a a a

2424
01:51:18,359 --> 01:51:23,439
something they sell over the counter in

2425
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:25,039
Mexico called kof oratam

2426
01:51:23,439 --> 01:51:27,879
which is essentially aspirin with

2427
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:31,039
ergotamine tartrate ergotamine tartrate

2428
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:33,520
if you don't know is a vasel constrictor

2429
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:36,960
that constricts your blood vessels like

2430
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:38,920
caffeine so that reduces headache pain

2431
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:40,118
and you know couple it with a aspirin

2432
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:42,480
which is

2433
01:51:40,118 --> 01:51:44,880
anti-inflammatory and you know you have

2434
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:48,279
a pretty effective headache

2435
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:50,960
medication well I knew that ergotamine

2436
01:51:48,279 --> 01:51:52,639
tartrate was also the main precursor for

2437
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,639
LSD

2438
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:58,359
and it is impossible to get you know you

2439
01:51:55,639 --> 01:52:01,039
even ask about it you're going to jail

2440
01:51:58,359 --> 01:52:04,039
you know it's it was so restricted

2441
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:05,560
unbelievably restricted because that was

2442
01:52:04,039 --> 01:52:08,760
what you needed at that time that was

2443
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:09,679
the synthesis route that everybody used

2444
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:12,719
and

2445
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:16,279
so I went to my cartel friends and I

2446
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:18,198
said hey by the way could you get you

2447
01:52:16,279 --> 01:52:19,840
know it's there's 55 gallon drums of

2448
01:52:18,198 --> 01:52:21,879
this sitting around somewhere where they

2449
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:24,239
manufacture this you guys think you

2450
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:26,920
could get get me that

2451
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:29,078
chemical they said well of course we can

2452
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:32,118
get it for you and we can get that for

2453
01:52:29,078 --> 01:52:36,158
you and any other precursor chemicals

2454
01:52:32,118 --> 01:52:38,479
that you might need so an idea started

2455
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:42,839
forming in my PE

2456
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:45,718
brain uh these guys can get me all the

2457
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:47,279
precursor chemicals I need to make

2458
01:52:45,719 --> 01:52:49,719
LSD

2459
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:51,439
and wow that sounds like a good idea you

2460
01:52:49,719 --> 01:52:56,078
know we'll redirect the cartel a little

2461
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:59,879
bit away from cocaine towards LSD and uh

2462
01:52:56,078 --> 01:53:02,559
so I set about acquiring those precursor

2463
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:04,480
chemicals and I have to I have to ask

2464
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:09,800
what year about was

2465
01:53:04,479 --> 01:53:12,238
this uh this was in the mid

2466
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:14,960
80s okay and

2467
01:53:12,238 --> 01:53:17,359
so I started acquiring more and more

2468
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:20,840
chemicals I I told them look I need to

2469
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:23,920
get a huge volume I calculated what I

2470
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:26,520
would need for everyone in the world and

2471
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:29,880
then I multiplied it times

2472
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:31,079
four so I had enough precursor chemical

2473
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:33,078
it's not as much as you might think

2474
01:53:31,078 --> 01:53:36,719
because it's you know quite concentrated

2475
01:53:33,078 --> 01:53:39,880
but still quite a bit and lot started to

2476
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:42,760
assemble enough LSD chemicals for

2477
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:45,440
everyone in the world four times over

2478
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:46,920
and I I resolved I you know there's a

2479
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:49,479
lot of lab technique involved with

2480
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:52,158
making LSD it's quite difficult what you

2481
01:53:49,479 --> 01:53:54,919
may see on the street often times is a

2482
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:57,479
super of isomers that have a very

2483
01:53:54,920 --> 01:54:01,440
unfocused effect it's not

2484
01:53:57,479 --> 01:54:04,718
lsd2 which requires several purification

2485
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:06,678
steps that are occasionally omitted so I

2486
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:09,118
resolved I'm going to make the best LSD

2487
01:54:06,679 --> 01:54:13,239
anybody's ever seen because I you know I

2488
01:54:09,118 --> 01:54:16,920
grew up on on ousley LSD right and so

2489
01:54:13,238 --> 01:54:21,559
assemble all this smuggle it across the

2490
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:24,000
border and using again old man George

2491
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:26,800
and part of his crew one of his friends

2492
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:29,760
who was a tugboat captain in New York

2493
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:33,039
they drive it all the way up to San

2494
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:36,119
Francisco and I find a storage facility

2495
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:39,639
at the airport in

2496
01:54:36,118 --> 01:54:43,319
nevado and I actually had um um you know

2497
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:47,440
was like a double siiz huge storage

2498
01:54:43,319 --> 01:54:49,319
facility and uh so I started stocking

2499
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:51,439
all these chemicals in there and I set

2500
01:54:49,319 --> 01:54:53,799
up a laboratory state-of-the-art

2501
01:54:51,439 --> 01:54:54,919
Laboratory and I started making proof of

2502
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:56,920
concept

2503
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:59,078
batches uh making you know trying to

2504
01:54:56,920 --> 01:55:02,480
make the best LSD I could possibly make

2505
01:54:59,078 --> 01:55:05,880
and I I figured I I'd stored in in

2506
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:08,198
thermal uh containers that were packed

2507
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:10,599
with nitrogen so there would be no

2508
01:55:08,198 --> 01:55:11,919
degradation and I'd bury you know I'd

2509
01:55:10,599 --> 01:55:13,319
make it make it make it and then I'd

2510
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,880
bury a whole bunch and then I would just

2511
01:55:13,319 --> 01:55:18,000
pull out what I needed over time and I'd

2512
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:21,560
bury it in different places and I just

2513
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:25,479
had this whole plan you know of how I

2514
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:27,960
was going to supply LSD to everyone and

2515
01:55:25,479 --> 01:55:31,319
you know I was still thinking at that

2516
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:33,800
time that LSD would fuel a social

2517
01:55:31,319 --> 01:55:36,840
revolution in America this is just what

2518
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:39,599
America needs uh

2519
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:41,679
so now now I'm I'm starting to make

2520
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:44,159
these batches and it's coming out really

2521
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:47,239
good really really

2522
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:50,559
good and uh and I'm just going to take

2523
01:55:47,238 --> 01:55:53,439
this up story up to this point uh I had

2524
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:55,560
a friend who was working with me it was

2525
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:57,559
actually the guy who I had worked with

2526
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:59,719
on the mushroom project who watered my

2527
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:02,679
mushrooms for me he wasn't extremely

2528
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:04,960
knowledgeable but he thought I needed a

2529
01:56:02,679 --> 01:56:08,279
particular chemical that I didn't

2530
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:09,920
need and he went to the East Bay to a

2531
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:12,880
chemical supply house in East Bay to get

2532
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:15,440
it turns out that chemical supply house

2533
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:17,639
was a DEA

2534
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:19,479
thing and it had been set up to catch

2535
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:22,639
people trying to acquire

2536
01:56:19,479 --> 01:56:26,479
methamphetamine precursors and he got

2537
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:28,480
this and they he used fake ID to get it

2538
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:30,319
so that set off a red flag even though

2539
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:34,158
they hadn't been looking for this

2540
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:38,799
particular chemical and

2541
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:41,960
uh they followed him and he took his

2542
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:45,119
chemical back to my storage facility and

2543
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:47,078
they followed him back to my storage

2544
01:56:45,118 --> 01:56:49,960
facility

2545
01:56:47,078 --> 01:56:53,198
and I think it was you know several days

2546
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:54,800
later I went to check on on the

2547
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:57,039
chemicals in the storage

2548
01:56:54,800 --> 01:57:01,239
facility and they were all

2549
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:03,639
gone everything was gone and my friend I

2550
01:57:01,238 --> 01:57:07,799
was calling him he's nowhere to be

2551
01:57:03,639 --> 01:57:10,880
found and I noticed that the only thing

2552
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:14,760
in the storage is a Post-It

2553
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:18,520
node and it says this is the

2554
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:21,159
DEA get a hold of us and it had a phone

2555
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:24,040
number and that was

2556
01:57:21,158 --> 01:57:27,118
it so now I'm sitting there thinking

2557
01:57:24,039 --> 01:57:28,960
well if I have to assume that they know

2558
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:31,000
me or you know that they've investigated

2559
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:33,118
enough to trace this to me I I just

2560
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,719
assume the worst so I said I'm either

2561
01:57:33,118 --> 01:57:37,439
going on the run right now with whatever

2562
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:40,118
money I have and I was rolling pretty

2563
01:57:37,439 --> 01:57:45,198
good at that point uh I either go on the

2564
01:57:40,118 --> 01:57:48,679
run or I lawyer up and go talk to these

2565
01:57:45,198 --> 01:57:53,519
guys so I got the best lawyers in San

2566
01:57:48,679 --> 01:57:53,520
Francisco and went to talk to him

2567
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:59,480
and I went I I met them at uh the a law

2568
01:57:57,639 --> 01:58:01,279
one of the law offices of one of the

2569
01:57:59,479 --> 01:58:03,359
lawyers I had I had like two of the best

2570
01:58:01,279 --> 01:58:06,039
lawyers in San Francisco I won't mention

2571
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:09,639
their names they've since uh both passed

2572
01:58:06,039 --> 01:58:12,238
on uh really great guys incredible both

2573
01:58:09,639 --> 01:58:14,920
of them and one of them was a former

2574
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:19,238
Federal prosecutor and that's whose

2575
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:22,118
office I met at and so I'm sitting there

2576
01:58:19,238 --> 01:58:26,158
waiting and This Crew shows up from the

2577
01:58:22,118 --> 01:58:29,839
the DEA it's a you know a tax

2578
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:32,319
guy a f you know a de a couple DEA

2579
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:33,960
agents and these guys are super lowlevel

2580
01:58:32,319 --> 01:58:37,599
and they're like astonished they have no

2581
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:39,599
idea what to do with any of this and uh

2582
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:43,119
one of the guys that's with him is this

2583
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:45,760
[ __ ] uh who who starts trying to tell

2584
01:58:43,118 --> 01:58:47,880
me that you know you're going to jail

2585
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:50,119
for 50 years you're never going to see

2586
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:52,679
the light of day he actually started

2587
01:58:50,118 --> 01:58:54,719
pacing off the dimensions of the cell

2588
01:58:52,679 --> 01:58:59,199
that I was going to be in uh just to

2589
01:58:54,719 --> 01:59:00,960
show me how big the cell was uh and uh

2590
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:03,919
you know this

2591
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:06,158
group was suddenly another group showed

2592
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:09,279
up and they were superseded by a much

2593
01:59:06,158 --> 01:59:10,559
larger group and this group was composed

2594
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:15,039
of a

2595
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:15,920
judge top level DEA FBI Alcohol Tobacco

2596
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:18,800
and

2597
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:21,719
Firearms justice department people and

2598
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:24,400
it was led by a judge so if they needed

2599
01:59:21,719 --> 01:59:25,719
a SE warrant they had a judge in toe

2600
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:29,039
that they could just write a search

2601
01:59:25,719 --> 01:59:32,319
warrant if they wanted to so here's this

2602
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:35,158
highlevel group and they lean in the

2603
01:59:32,319 --> 01:59:37,719
other group leaves and they said well we

2604
01:59:35,158 --> 01:59:41,000
have done some research on who you are

2605
01:59:37,719 --> 01:59:43,760
and we think you can help us with a very

2606
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,319
difficult situation that we're having uh

2607
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:48,480
there's a guy on the border that you

2608
01:59:45,319 --> 01:59:51,519

2624
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:38,840
in fact I had worked with him and he had

2625
02:00:34,078 --> 02:00:41,238
used our warehouse on occasion uh and I

2626

2627
02:00:41,238 --> 02:00:45,279

02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:50,238
looking at 50 years to life there's just

2629
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:53,118

02:01:00,359 --> 02:01:04,559
who was kind of leading the discussion

2634
02:01:02,439 --> 02:01:07,598

these stories because that's

2650
02:01:52,880 --> 02:02:00,960
um I will tell you that the story gets

2651
02:01:57,279 --> 02:02:04,039
much crazier from here and you're

2652
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:05,560
writing a book I assume yes I just

2653
02:02:04,039 --> 02:02:07,319
finished it and I'm actually working

2654
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:08,440
with an editor we're hoping for a

2655
02:02:07,319 --> 02:02:12,039
release in

2656
02:02:08,439 --> 02:02:15,359
Spring um you know I I'm toying with all

2657
02:02:12,039 --> 02:02:18,000
these different titles in my wife favors

2658
02:02:15,359 --> 02:02:20,559
it was a different time because I always

2659
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:23,960
say that it was a different time it was

2660
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:25,800
a different time uh subtitle Chronicles

2661
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:26,800
of a psychedelic Pioneer and the reign

2662
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:30,679
of the

2663
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:32,639
cartels uh and uh since then my editor

2664
02:02:30,679 --> 02:02:34,279
said look I you have all these other

2665
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:36,840
stories that didn't make it into the

2666
02:02:34,279 --> 02:02:39,000
book go ahead and write those stories up

2667
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:42,159
she started reading those stories and

2668
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,719
she's like God we got to put these in so

2669
02:02:42,158 --> 02:02:45,158
now the book is going to be much larger

2670
02:02:43,719 --> 02:02:48,800
and I'm going to filter in all these

2671
02:02:45,158 --> 02:02:51,879
other stories uh which are

2672
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:53,320
independently equally hair raising and

2673
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:56,359
interesting

2674
02:02:53,319 --> 02:02:59,479
thrilling uh but I want I want you guys

2675
02:02:56,359 --> 02:03:03,519
to understand that you know getting weed

2676
02:02:59,479 --> 02:03:06,319
wasn't what it was today you know you

2677
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:09,679
didn't go to a dispensary and buy an

2678
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:12,479
eighth of weed you imported it from

2679
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:16,078
Colombia from Thailand and each one of

2680
02:03:12,479 --> 02:03:19,678
these places the name would elicit all

2681
02:03:16,078 --> 02:03:23,039
these Notions of quality and you know

2682
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:25,760
style and everything else and you know

2683
02:03:23,039 --> 02:03:29,639
it was like kind of a international

2684
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:32,039
supermarket and in that environment you

2685
02:03:29,639 --> 02:03:34,078
know there was also

2686
02:03:32,039 --> 02:03:36,399
psychedelics cocaine a little bit here

2687
02:03:34,078 --> 02:03:40,039
and there not quite as much but

2688
02:03:36,399 --> 02:03:42,879
primarily cannabis and uh you know a lot

2689
02:03:40,039 --> 02:03:45,039
of it was centered in the Bay Area you

2690
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,520
know the earliest thae weed kind of came

2691
02:03:45,039 --> 02:03:50,000
in through the Bay Area and I have some

2692
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:53,280
good stories there as well

2693
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:56,189
but you know pretty much I've gotten

2694
02:03:53,279 --> 02:04:12,460
11:00 so maybe we should stop

2695
02:03:56,189 --> 02:04:12,460
