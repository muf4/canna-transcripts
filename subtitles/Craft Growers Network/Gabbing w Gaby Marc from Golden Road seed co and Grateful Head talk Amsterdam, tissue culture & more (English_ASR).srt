before we get started yeah we I met

28
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,640
Gabby like what what is it now 20 days

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,478
ago over Instagram and uh we've been

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,640
connecting like you don't connect

31
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,519
normally like this every day to to

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,439
somebody so I instantly also knew that

33
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,759
he's a brother you know from another

34
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,559
mother and uh yeah you know this Our

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
Generation I think is one of these

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,600
Generations that lived through sometimes

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,478
that if you know somebody you don't need

38
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,199
to hear a lot and then you it's just

39
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:00,679
natural it happens it's like this

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,039
chemistry right

41
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,680
um and actually the after these two

42
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:09,239
podcast now uh I'm really I mean it's

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,879
it's normalized now for me that we we

44
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,400
are we are communicating so much

45
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,439
actually because like you know I want to

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,039
to to maintain this all the way through

47
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,159
and I'm really happy that you invite me

48
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,679
all the time to this podcast because I

49
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,560
think I represent a lot of the Europeans

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,319
uh Growers and craft uh people in kabes

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,560
that maybe um should also have a voice

52
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:34,119
and uh in the future I think there will

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,080
be others that will join the

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,080
conversation yeah that's beautiful in

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,840
international connectivity through the

56
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,680
plant we l is a beautiful thing yes and

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,680

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:54,200

60
00:02:54,199 --> 00:03:01,318
communicating and it was similar to my

61
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:03,518
relationship with my my Slovenian Hobbit

62
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,878

break the seal you know like or the way

94
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,758
Sasha says you know he helped me turn

95
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,000
over the Rock and once it's turned over

96
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,479
it's hard to hard to close it you know

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
it's like opening up the box you can't

98
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:38,038
close it um he's a great guy he's doing

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,478
marem tissue culture at home you know

100
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:40,918
which I think is pretty interesting you

101
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,478
know there's a lot of people doing Nal

102
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,918
tissue culture you know as a hobby and

103
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:47,560
as a home thing but he's actually doing

104
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,799
marem tissue culture at home so I think

105
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,120
that uh he has a lot to offer people on

106
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,840
this network as well so we're going to

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,439
get started and the first thing I want

108
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,279
to do is um tell Mark what we're trying

109
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,879
to do is give you an opportunity to tell

110
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:06,478
your story okay and we don't want The

111
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,800
Abridged version we want you to you know

112
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,399
tell us your whole story let's start

113
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,038
let's start from you know how you were

114
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,439
originally exposed to cannabis and you

115
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,759
know move your way through what you're

116
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,918
doing

117
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:23,400
today I originally was exposed to weed

118
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:26,079
at around the age of 12 and I lived in

119
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,279
Lower bux Town EPA north of Philly and

120
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,918
it was um I'd say a reasonably affluent

121
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,038
community and directly across the street

122
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,599
my best friend lived and it was housing

123
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:38,478
projects but I got along with everybody

124
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,199
and I would hang out there I would play

125
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,719
basketball that's where all my friends

126
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,360
were and back then nobody really cared

127
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
there wasn't as much as a sigtigma it

128
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,960
seemed so I would be across the street

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,840
playing basketball and my best friend

130
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,918
lived there and he called me over one

131
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:58,318
day his um brother-in-law was a weed

132
00:05:54,918 --> 00:06:01,359
dealer and he had managed to to snag a

133
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,439
handful of roaches from the ashtray so

134
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:09,000
the very first time from uh the the the

135
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,800
sister husband was a dealer so he lifted

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,120
some right from the ashtray and uh I

137
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,840
remember clear's day um we had a ball

138
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,360
field near the highway where we' play

139
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,719
baseball and there was a malberry tree

140
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,960
there and he rolled this big pregnant

141
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,680
duber out of all the roaches and I can

142
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,680
remember just sitting under the tree

143
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,959
like oh my God my whole world just

144
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,079
exploded and I was like wow that's what

145
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:37,079
this is and uh it lasted forever and I

146
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,719
remember it it lasted long enough that I

147
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,680
was uh wary of headed right home to let

148
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,240
let my my parents see I was definitely

149
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,360
not trying to get caught then at the

150
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,319
early age and uh that sparked to the in

151
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,360
that got the ball rolling and uh

152
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,560
eventually a few years later after that

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,759
happened um my family decided it would

154
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,680
be better to move me from the city into

155
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,639
a more rural situation and they bought a

156
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,240
bunch of horses and a farm and uh that's

157
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:10,000
where where it really ramped up so

158
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,639
having compost as a kid you know it's

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,439
the last place you want to have to do

160
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,319
weed whacking and in gardening and we

161
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,319
had a huge Manor pile and I always took

162
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:22,639
notice how big all the weeds got in the

163
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:25,720
pile so my family inadvertently hired

164
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,199
dead heads as Farm hands not knowing see

165
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,680
where I'm going with this what a dead

166
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,280
head was and I was I was in M Glory I'm

167
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,478
like I work with these guys so long

168
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,559
story short they were getting really

169
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,439
high-end Imports back then we're going

170
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,360
back to

171
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,959
1982 83 as a 13-year-old I'm I'm on this

172
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,439
farm

173
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:51,399
so I would I would buy 50 $50 ounces of

174
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,120
high-end Imports that came from like the

175
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:57,038
Le Mexico there were some ties back then

176
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,560
and it wasn't bricked the way we know it

177
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,598
fully it was compacted and it was just

178
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,560
very lightly feeded so uh I remember

179
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:07,598
getting the out I'd pay them and they'd

180
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,519
hide it in the mailbox after the mail

181
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,478
people already came my parents wouldn't

182
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,120
find it so when I'd pay them I'd walk

183
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:17,519
down to the mailbox you know at 12:00

184
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,598
and uh grab my out in this particular

185
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:25,639
bag that uh was B I believe it came from

186
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,918
B I really love so I already knew where

187
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,840
I was going to put it because I had a

188
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:32,319
man nor pile so the first feed that I

189
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:35,199
grew was was a very young teenager and

190
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,479
uh I got a pound off that one plant and

191
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,879
it was better than the weed that it came

192
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,360
from and then man that was Off to the

193
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:46,439
Races but you never found it in the

194
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,680
compost pile yeah I got a pound plant as

195
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,720
a teenager not knowing

196
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,559
anything how how did you get away with

197
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,000
it how did your parents not find

198
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,919
it they knew I was getting ston by then

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,759
and um my dad dad colorated it Dad was

200
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,879
cool and I found out later he might have

201
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,838
been a closet smoker and he hid it from

202
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,720
me that came out a little later so he he

203
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,519
Let It Rock out no there were times

204
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,959
believe me it's a teenager when I'd piss

205
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,078
him off that he would get the weed

206
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,639
whacker and just stand there in slow

207
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:18,479
motion and go from the top of the bottom

208
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,039
of the plant while making eye contact

209
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,320
with

210
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:26,278
me so I learned the hard way but after

211
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,560
that you know High Times became a thing

212
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,078
and I started collecting those and um

213
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,199
that was when the first knowledge of

214
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:36,838
Amsterdam and genetics and all that you

215
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,200
know really came into my mind and I

216
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,079
think then after that I started uh I

217
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,000
bought marijuana botney I bought the

218
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:47,799
marijuana growers Bible and

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,839
uh I I think I first started growing

220
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,599
with chemicals not knowing any better

221
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,000
because there wasn't a lot out there on

222
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,320
organic and the only things we had

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,720
available in the 80s '90s were like

224
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,879
rapid grow Peter 2020 Miracle Grow so

225
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,200
that was my next

226
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,600
Advance was like maybe it's not a good

227
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,040
idea to put it in the manor pile dad May

228
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,079
chop it down so then it it mve to um

229
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,159
digging big holes like I read about in

230
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,599
some of the books and then putting I

231
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,958
just put straight compost in the hole

232
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,680
and it work PL plants would have new

233
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,078
deficiencies when they were G but I was

234
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,239
just excited I'm making Bud

235
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,679
yearly and it it kept going then with uh

236
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,519
those commercial indoors and uh some of

237
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,159
them wouldn't finished obviously because

238
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,839
they were equatorial but the ones that

239
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:40,199
did were and um I kept doing that for a

240
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:43,399
while until after graduating high school

241
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,399
1989 uh the next year there had been a

242
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,720
local guy that was a legend that was a

243
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,360
year ahead of me that had already

244
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,759
graduated that had the best weed around

245
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,079
and he was trying to stand office but I

246
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,958
I grew some balls one day and I I went

247
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,159
to his house unannounced and that's

248
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:03,159
where he handed me a brown paper bag I

249
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,120
can still see it with these plants that

250
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,759
had really fat leaves I never I look

251
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,799
like cabbage I never thought or been

252
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:13,240
exposed cannabis indicia other than the

253
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:15,719
ads and uh that's when my first breeding

254
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,000
started as a team and to this day I

255
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,759
think that may be M Grail

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,278
Afghan I'm the opposite of him he never

257
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,759
took notes so when I inquired about what

258
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,200
this is he said I would think it was

259
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,399
some Afghan i' had gotten from Vermont

260
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,440
so I drew that out and was just blown

261
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,639
away I mean that the was growing was

262
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,480
great but this stuff is narcotic it had

263
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:44,399
family bigger than my hand tight inner

264
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,759
nodes and it didn't mold so ran that

265
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,958
through um the end of the 80s through

266
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,759
the 90s but I really even though I read

267
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,278
books I didn't have the real-time

268
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,200
breeding chop and I remember each

269
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,240
successive cross maybe I didn't do the

270
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,560
best selection but it didn't resemble

271
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,959
what I first started with so out of

272
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:06,518
frustration in we're getting to the mid

273
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:08,559
90s once the punch was lost I realized I

274
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:12,200
I needed to go to

275
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:15,119
Amsterdam so I saved money and it took a

276
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,399
while as a kid you know and young man

277
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,519
then uh to get the money together and

278
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,360
the first year I went there was

279
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,720
1999 and it was for money I saved for my

280
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:30,000
my outdoor escapades you know so that

281
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,480
was the first year and I went over there

282
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,039
and

283
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,759
amazingly I ended up meeting Neville

284
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:39,480
inadvertently and this is a crazy story

285
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:44,120
um it was with my ACT Rec recently

286
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,920
deceased from cancer and um anyhow we

287
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,278
walked off the beaten path off of Dam

288
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:51,799
Square into a very small I I believe the

289
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:55,078
name of it was the Emerald Triangle

290
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:57,000
Trading Company where I met an American

291
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,679
who owned the place and we had mentioned

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,278
Neville and he said well speak of the

293
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,679
devil I believe I have an appointment

294
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,360
with him if you want to hang out and

295
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:07,799
meet him and that's when he walked in in

296
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,519
proper business attire leather atach

297
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,838
case and I bought super silver hay seeds

298
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,440
from him that he sucked out of the weed

299
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,680
there um I have an old CS of the whole

300

the old Cam corters that I need to get

302
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:26,039
converted converted to D which I plan on

303
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,240
plan on sharing that in the near future

304
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:32,799

328
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,198
Library

329
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,680
um I had met Adam done there at TH seeds

330
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,879
we we recently did a um an anniversary

331
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:43,879
issue which was pretty cool chop it up

332
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:48,439
um but from what I remember I got Durban

333
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:52,039
Poison the first year I got Sia Gunk I

334
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,720
got Early Skunk from them I got juicy

335
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:56,879
fruit from

336
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,560
them and maybe a few others I forget

337
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,639
because that was a very long time ago

338
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,399
but I can remember what I got from Adam

339
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,360
dun because he had shared something he

340
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,240
wasn't sharing with the public as well

341
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:13,240
uh from chds headquarters I got um Puna

342
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,560
butter which is no longer on the menu

343
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,079
um chocolate something or other

344
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:22,838
chocolate trip maybe no longer on his

345
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:25,799
menu um and I got the sage which made a

346
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:29,040
huge impact on me we'll we'll get into a

347
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,120
little bit more of that later and um

348
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,639
then I remember oh yeah MK Ultra that's

349
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,519
another one I brought back that first

350
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,360
trick but then I remember thinking maybe

351
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,078
it's best to ask Adam if he has

352
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,120
something that's not released to the

353
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:46,439
public that he would come come up off of

354
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,799
um Adam gave me poana which I believe is

355
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,639
a Robert canel Clark

356
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:55,559
heirloom uh sativa which was the early

357
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:58,600
building block of early Pearl and um

358
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:02,239
silver Pearl so I managed to to get that

359
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,600
from him and um some of the others were

360
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,278
yumol from Sager Matha which was just

361
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,319
absolutely amazing I don't think that's

362
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:15,039
even in circulation anymore

363
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:18,159
um his bubbleberry which was absolutely

364
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:21,039
incredible uh what else did I get from

365
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:24,360
him that really made an impression on

366
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:27,439
me um the Western Winds which is a CI

367
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,839
myth knockoff that was also amazing did

368
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,000
you get the sage or the sage and sour I

369
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,319
got the

370
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,039
shade that was one that wasn't one that

371
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:41,198
he gave out no he us sage and sour but I

372
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,759
I don't remember him releasing the sage

373
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,120
he did the sage was a regular release

374
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,159
and then it became feminized later in

375
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,759
time the seed was definitely released to

376
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,958
the general public because the seeds I

377
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,919
bought were in the thcs packaging and I

378
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,758
ended up running a cut commercially that

379
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:59,879
we kept around for years that really did

380
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,039
good in PA I eventually ended up uh

381
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,919
naming my band stage that made such an

382
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,399
impact and we we band it pretty well for

383
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,360
good many years

384
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,480
so yeah it all dat it all dates back to

385
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,678
that faithful trip and then

386
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,439
um 99 I went

387
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:21,640
back or no I'm sorry 99 was first year I

388
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:24,038
went back 2001 and that's when I started

389
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,799
noticing a discernable difference in the

390
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:31,119
Fenty seed stock and that's when I as

391
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:33,079
Adam dun coined term I got dutched

392
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:37,319
because I went to my tri and TRS and

393
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:40,159
that it makes sense that that

394
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,759
holdovers that were still good after the

395
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,480
raids but some of the stock took the hit

396
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:47,160
hit early on because I remember bringing

397
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,038
the same Durban back from the same

398
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,480
vendor I went to the last time and all

399
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,599
of it was hey it was like

400
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,360
unrecognizable that was the the last

401
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:59,319
trip I took there but I think one of the

402
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:02,678
things I want to delve into is pre9 8

403
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:05,678
seems to be the the desired stock but a

404
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:08,600
lot of the dut vendors had leftover

405
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,440
stock that extended into the 2000s of

406
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:14,000
those trains so a lot of people think

407
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,240
after 2000 um it was undesirable it all

408
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,720
depends on if it was hold over or not

409
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,759
because they had both that lasted

410
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,279
probably I think into 2001 and maybe

411
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,359
even beyond that was when I first

412
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,599
started noticing their pack weren't good

413
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:31,119
you

414
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:33,359
know well Al others not only Sensi sits

415
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,119
I will tell you now you know there is

416
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,798
other big big producers that are still

417
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,918
on the scene from The Dutch scene and

418
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:44,240
the same team you know maybe maybe Simon

419
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,520
fius stayed the same uh I I I met him a

420
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,839
few times but he he always kept his few

421
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:52,119
strains you know what I mean and then he

422
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:54,839
bought up the MOs genetics uh when when

423
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,199
MOS was closed right so that was the

424
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,480
only

425
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,720
yeah Garrett the breeder I that brings

426
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,360
back memories because his his warlock

427
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,720
was insanity and that a shout out to my

428
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:09,599
boy Johnny Bones a grateful heads um

429
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,919
he's he's got a warlock cut that's a

430
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,639
banger and that's maget genetic jerett

431
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:18,280
was the breeder if I recall from memory

432
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,038
yes and uh you know I don't know the

433
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,519
story why uh the the the MOs genetics

434
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,759
stopped working but I know that Simon

435
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,720
took over the genetics we had a double

436
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,119
dutch uh cut in Austria circulating for

437
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,159
many years I think it's still alive uh

438
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:37,199
circulating still uh it was also still a

439
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:41,000
really really strong plant you know

440
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,798
branchy stocky uh has particular uh

441
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,759
attributes you know that everybody wants

442
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,720
so yeah these genetics are still alive

443
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:51,038
uh in some little you know in in little

444
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,440
even the Earth Bly you know before we

445
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,558
record you talk about the Swiss genetics

446
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,840
right you you remember the the arly and

447
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:03,158
the the the the old the uh old seeds you

448
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:06,000
know uh Al production and Felix MTH

449
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,720
producing beautiful flowers in F

450
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,119
Switzerland of course I would never

451
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,798
forget that yeah that is it's a big and

452
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,079
very little known part of cannabis

453
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:20,480
history over there yes all uh his name

454
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:23,480
was uh Felix Couts and I think he really

455
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,558
was a so you know this real cannabis

456
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,360
Soldier you know the one like like you

457
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,440
know some sometimes people say that the

458
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,519
hippies that came you know the the trail

459
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,360
the hippie trail that was before the

460
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,000
Pioneers that got the the genetics from

461
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,519
these far lands you know that came to

462
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,960
the west then you know for us to to

463
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,158
enjoy like you said before you know you

464
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,558
you got the the land races let me say

465
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,559
and then it watered down in time and

466
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:52,240
then you went to Amsterdam in the right

467
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,480
time right so please continue because

468
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,839
it's really interesting what you're

469
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,640
telling oh yeah yeah so so we were

470
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:03,959
dependent on the the train and after the

471
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,919
Dutch bank fell off because I was lost a

472
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,279
lot of them paid for mortgages for us

473
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,679
and

474
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,798
uh aware of cannabis Canada Cannabis

475
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:16,080
culture and whole thing going on up

476
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:18,798
there thank you to hot Times magazine so

477
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,960
the D St fell off and I I blew a lot of

478
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:24,639
money on my last trip to Amsterdam

479
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:29,319
unfortunately um I started using um Mark

480
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,759
emry Heaven Stairway um Hemp Depot DC

481
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:35,119
Seed Company

482
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:38,000
um British Columbia seed company and I

483
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:41,319
was amazed and it wasn't like when you

484
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,599
sent seeds to someone in Amsterdam where

485
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:45,519
you wait a month you don't get any back

486
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,240
then there wasn't tracking and you might

487
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,400
get them you would check the mailbox if

488
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,839
you like maybe show up in two months

489
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,120
Canada was closer and it was quicker and

490
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:58,079
uh that was the next thing because we I

491
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,479
really panicked and uh I really wasn't

492
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:03,119
doing a ton of dedicated breeding there

493
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,200
just some chucks at home because the

494
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,158
genetics I knew would work and I needed

495
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,600
them to keep you know keep the lights

496
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:14,520
going so uh then I started running um

497
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:17,959
off the top of my head

498
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:19,960
um Dutch tree times purple skunk from a

499
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,640
probably now defun breeder that did

500
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,600
really well for us um I sweet skunk from

501
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,080
feder and that's the other one I forgot

502
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:32,119
did great for us in our climate um

503
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,639
and what else did I find some there that

504
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,639
was a staple

505
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,440
um GTC company I believe it was White

506
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
Widow times nl5 and I can't remember the

507
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,159
name it might have been called white

508
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,440
lightning or the lightning or something

509
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,640
like that so ran out for a while and

510
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,038
kind of the same thing started happening

511
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,559
with those Banks quality went down some

512
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,960
of them just went completely defun and

513
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,119
uh this might have

514
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,798
been cir

515
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,639
2002 three through four I think it

516
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:08,599
started to fall off and that's when um

517
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:13,919
on itm I discovered you know brers that

518
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:16,918
were local like bog oh yeah B seats yes

519
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,400
Bubble Gum my life that ched my life

520
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,679
from then on um I got his first feed

521
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,159
going back to his first drop and that

522
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,320
was a game changer for me and not only

523
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,000
were they cheaper they were domestic I I

524
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:30,599
could get them shipped and it would take

525
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,919
a month before you got them you'd know

526
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:36,038
you get them and uh yeah I I kept

527
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,960
running with that and that's when um I

528
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:40,720
really started doing my first successful

529
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:44,720
Chucks and then going back line breeding

530
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,400
stuff uh I think not shortly after that

531
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,200
if I recall from memory was also you old

532
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:54,440
your felt forarm was up and that's where

533
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,400
I got some um from Guy the uh 88 G13

534
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,278
half plant that was going around on

535
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,880
treating yourself for him which I still

536
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,720
have I managed to keep CA skunk from

537
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:08,480
that first trip which I'm about to F4 I

538
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,000
have those in SE stock Early Skunk I

539
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,558
still have which needs to have an

540
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,599
increase done in the the super skunk

541
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:17,240
pack it just came into my hands I will

542
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,000
not get there but that's that's a whole

543
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,640
another topic because Blown Away

544
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,960
somebody randomly who I had a few

545
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,080
Communications with out of nowhere sh

546
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,720
you know I feel like these would do good

547
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:32,759
in your hands and that's kind of how

548
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,960
that came to fruition

549
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,319
nice have have you um like what what

550
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,278
what do you getting off of the super

551
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:42,918
skunk I know that you just put it into

552
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:45,278
flower but um like are does it bring

553
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:48,520
back any any memories of perhaps running

554
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:52,159
it from a you know decades earlier

555
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:55,679
or yeah the plant are poot on man and I

556
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:59,360
I have a pecul overactive whole Factory

557
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,038
fence pallet it's it's weird where I can

558
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,599
a smell from a decade ago will register

559
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,599
with me and then I'll put that memory

560
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,918
together so they they are spoton as I

561
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:12,519
remember them same length morpholog and

562
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,919
very uniform for an F1 cross that's what

563
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:19,359
they were when they made them

564
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:21,799
um I got only eight feed and they're all

565
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,839
going there were a total of five male

566
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:27,119
and three females and um there's

567
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:30,038
basically two main phenotypes I'm seeing

568
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:34,119
and the one is probably the U the maple

569
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:36,319
leaf aan leaner and I'd like to call

570
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:40,599
that a totem structure with minimal side

571
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:42,240
breaching they all have non Hollow stems

572
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,000
and that's the other indicator that I

573
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,240
know

574
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,038
um um and I think the St Rubes that I'm

575
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,558
getting from them the one phenotype is

576
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:56,240
like haate thinner turpentine where with

577
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:59,480
an almost sulfuric smell with skunk

578
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,839
mixed in there and the other phenotype

579
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:06,360
is chunky GD Afghan type with maybe the

580
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:08,678
back end of I'm very good at describing

581
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:11,240
Tarpin the creamy sweetness almost

582
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,360
defies description I would say maybe

583
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,000
maybe Citrus but we're not talking

584
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,918
anything fruity at all here we're

585
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,839
talking maybe

586
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,399
grapefruit and uh that's exactly how I

587
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:25,959
remember them so the ttail shine will be

588
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:28,759
the orange pistols because that was a

589
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,480
signature tra that when I grew Out

590
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,640
outdoors from 90 stock that they they

591
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,519
had and they were also bulletproof I

592
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,038
remember them getting rained on and

593
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:41,558
having no mold whatsoever so very

594
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:44,480
cool yeah you know one thing that I

595
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:48,158
remember about the super skunk when we

596
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,640
used to grow it is every single crop I

597
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,760
would hold the censi Seed Catalog up

598
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,759
against my flowers and it looked

599
00:26:53,759 --> 00:27:00,679
identical and to this day it's the only

600
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:02,480
seeds that I've ever ever purchased that

601
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,840
looked exactly like the photo that they

602
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,558
were advertised with you know they good

603
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,639
well I mean the thing is that even

604
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:13,319
cultural practices could change the way

605
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,720
flowers look you know like if I grow the

606
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:16,918
same flowers as you or as Nick they're

607
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,679
going to come out looking a little bit

608
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:22,960
different but with the super skunk it

609
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,798
was unbelievable that it looked

610
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,360
identical to the catalog was the most

611
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:31,798
uniform strain I've ever seen that a

612
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:34,119
great way to valid for sure and uh

613
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:38,079
that's another interesting we should get

614
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:40,719
into later how the them cut grown by

615
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,319
three different people will always look

616
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,880
different I've even had things I've

617
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,839
given to somebody that was completely

618
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,240
different and I'm not going to lie

619
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,599
sometimes my own cut somebody was able

620
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,640
to maximize the genetic potential better

621
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:55,599
than I could and I'm like damn dude what

622
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,320
did you do you know and I don't get mad

623
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,719
about it I pick his brain so there's

624
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:02,639
something to be said about uh the plant

625
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,319
being an accumulator sympathetic

626
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,080
vibration from the person that it's

627
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,398
around and the energy that it gives off

628
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,720
and that's not some hippie [ __ ] no I

629
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:12,639
mean it can be hippie [ __ ] and be

630
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,679
real at the same point

631
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,399
right that's true

632
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:20,798
too yeah I mean some some plants yeah or

633
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,759
because like the the phenotypic

634
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:25,558
difference I've always heard like um you

635
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,158
know you have to take environment into

636
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:31,079
account because like if even if you're

637
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,320
like like a a cultivar let's say is like

638
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:36,720
the same cut but then the phenotype is

639
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:38,798
the production you know it's uh it's the

640
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,519
chemotype of like what is actually

641
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,759
produced based on the environmental

642
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,599
factors and the grow factors and yeah

643
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:48,398
the interactions with the grower

644
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:50,639
themselves and so I it I think that it's

645
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:54,319
super valid and maybe there's there's

646
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,440
also just a little bit of slight um Mis

647
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:59,678
terminology sometimes in the Cannabis

648
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,880
Community um just when it comes to how

649
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,399
we've used words in the past when it

650
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,640
wasn't something that we could openly

651
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:09,359
talk about with those who are educated

652
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,519
botanists or horticulturalists um but

653
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,119
yeah I think I think you're spot on like

654
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,720
it's it's going to change no matter

655
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:20,359
where you're growing it but if but if

656
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:22,640
something is super uh similar across

657
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:25,479
different growth environments and grow

658
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,120
Styles that's something that's that's

659
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,558
great because then you can actually have

660
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:33,359
something for someone in in like a you

661
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,879
know like in slovania uh right that they

662
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,719
can have like oh they want like the Cali

663
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,080
cookies uh or you know the Cali genetics

664
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,798
or whatnot but if you have something

665
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,319
that can grow the same across different

666
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:45,839
environments then that's how you can get

667
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:49,200
that into other people's

668
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,158
hands that's a very good point and uh I

669
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,480
think even even going further how a

670
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,480
plant will genetically acclimate to its

671
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,798
um to the to the outdoor environment and

672
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,640
become more resistant to things in your

673
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,119
own environment

674
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,679
there's needs to be more studies done on

675
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,518
that that aren't just Bro Science but

676
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:12,320
some real umol

677
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:14,319
group picture this this is it yeah I I

678
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:17,240
my opinion about this is let's go a

679
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,319
little bit deeper you know uh from from

680
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,480
the start you know Canabis behaves like

681
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,519
that it is a Survivor plant right it

682
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,440
would be it have to survive also without

683
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,278
uh the help of humans that's how it is

684
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,440
so the phenotypic expressions in a gin

685
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:36,119
pool are basically because if it grows

686
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,440
in a area where there is for example the

687
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,359
winter comes a little bit earlier some

688
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,919
years or the rainy season starts a

689
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:45,918
little bit earlier in the fall uh some

690
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:47,799
phenotypes Will Survive and because of

691
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,360
the cross pollination between the you

692
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:52,960
know it let's say it's inbr line it's in

693
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:55,240
not inbre but it's it's again wild

694
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,319
cannabis if we would put all these Kong

695
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,079
snow outside somewhere without the help

696
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:02,319
of humans something would happen and

697
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,199
what would happen in one year some

698
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,678
phenotypes would survive because there

699
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,679
was a dry season and they perform better

700
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,320
in dry seasons but they would be

701
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:14,360
pollinated but by males that would also

702
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:16,200
give them the genetics from others so

703
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,479
next year when there would be a wet

704
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,720
season the and the other phenotypes

705
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,839
would survive they will also carry the

706
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,759
genetics from the plants that would

707
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:27,720
survive the other Seasons you know what

708
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:31,000
I mean it's always in a gy pool because

709
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:35,319
it wants to survive That's the basis of

710
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,200
Canabis it's so hard it's so wants to

711
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:39,720
survive in in nature and like even even

712
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,960
going back to what we had talked about

713
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,079
last week too that so that's like over

714
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,360
over a period of time within a genetic

715
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,599
population like that where they're

716
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,918
picking up traits that are advantageous

717
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,798
to their survival that's the genetic

718
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,038
drift that uh I was talking about and

719
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,960
and we use genetic drift differently in

720
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,798
cannabis um but that that Within

721
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,079
population is the genetic drift and it's

722
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:04,398
a it's a positive change like almost

723
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,398
like a

724
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,760
microevolution that's why some people

725
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:11,359
get weird about things with tissue

726
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,638
culture because some of them think it's

727
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,119
unnatural and all but they don't realize

728
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:17,599
the chimeric and truncated Expressions

729
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:19,879
can occur

730
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:24,439
naturally the same things that happen

731
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,440
that's how we get mutations in nature

732
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,679
yep I've been waiting to use Eric in in

733
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,720
the fent by the way that was my time I'm

734
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:36,880
glad you I'm glad you were able to slip

735
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,880
that

736
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,919
in trunk mutations too so what so like

737
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,278
what what then happened next on on your

738
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:50,480
cannabis Journey Mark so you

739
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:53,480
um it it sounds like you like once you

740
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,558
were out of Pennsylvania or like um

741
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,480
where where were you where did you go to

742
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:59,879
from there well we can back up for that

743
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,919
part of the story and part of it I'm

744
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,000
going to intertwine what I did what I

745
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,720
did musically because it's all it's all

746
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,480
congruent with the whole story

747
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,720
so as this was happening and I got

748
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,558
better at breeding and I I had a

749
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,919
production cut that we you know we did

750
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,918
really well with um I walked into a head

751
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,120
shop in newo Pennsylvania called the now

752
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:24,200
and then shop and the clerk behind the

753
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:27,079
desk you know I talked to him and I said

754
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,159
uh you know I'm a guitar player nice to

755
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,918
meet you and from Good Buds let's go

756
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:33,159
smoke to Sage and that's how the band

757
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:37,440
Sage was started in early

758
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:41,000
2000s so in my in my Township I had

759
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,240
supported myself basically by by

760
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
cannabis in a non-legal state which is

761
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,960
had a trials and tribulations um we

762
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,440
started the band and the band started to

763
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,880
get bigger so I started to

764
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,000
do music festivals on the property

765
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,919
because my parents had a farm and it was

766
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,679
also for being honest a good way for me

767
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,038
to clean money because as the van got

768
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,519
bigger and the the population of the

769
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,798
event exceeded the town that it was in

770
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,878
so contractors could get a tax right off

771
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:12,878
if I put their name on our Banner um and

772
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:15,039
it got big and it was also a way that

773
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,960
kept me to continue the other operation

774
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,559
because that nobody had any any idea of

775
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,800
knowing how many people came in at the

776
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:22,878
gate or how much money was being

777
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,399
generated or not so I was able to do

778
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:29,440
that and incorporate it into a blur and

779
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,638
nobody messed with me I pretty much had

780
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,200
a symbiotic relationship with the corn

781
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,159
Farmers I would put thousands of plants

782
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,519
in their corn field we had no overhead

783
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,440
surveillance there and I would hand them

784
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,280
a paycheck every November and they were

785
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,679
making more money off doing that with me

786
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,280
than they were off their milk or their

787
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,358
feed corn so I'm like Johnny apple seed

788
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,800
in this very rural community in

789
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:55,199
Pennsylvania so enter

790
00:34:51,800 --> 00:35:00,920
2005 how many do you think you had

791
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:03,759
gone it was ARS all multip

792
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,440
proper well I would plant double what I

793
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,760
needed because half would always get

794
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:14,240
taken by Hunters by rippers um I rate

795
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Farm owners so it was a game a cat and

796
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,799
mouse with them it really was I mean

797
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,200
I've been shot I've been bitten by dogs

798
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,599
I've gotten cut by barbwire I mean it

799
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:28,319
went on and on until 2005 and it was all

800
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,119
local police though we didn't have State

801
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,920
Police or overhead

802
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,039
surveillance

803
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:39,079
but 2005 state police came and

804
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:40,719
unbeknownst to me they had Choppers and

805
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,800
they had Fleer

806
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:49,358
infrared so 2005's the first year I got

807
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,480
paid a visit and um it scared me good

808
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:54,480
but because I I didn't really H have any

809
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,119
priers at all um I got a slap on the

810
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,039
wrist and me being me you know and

811
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,318
somebody anti Authority and I feel it's

812
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:04,719
my god-given right to grow weed so it it

813
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:06,480
didn't stop me yeah I just mooved to

814
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:11,118
different locations I'd go out of the

815
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,960
County North or and uh I got to say it

816
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,000
was a different era back then because it

817
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,240
took a lot of people to pull this off it

818
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,960
took a lot of people not to tell it

819
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:21,159
would take me telling people to meet me

820
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,920
in the middle of a cornfield at midnight

821
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:26,159
with a truck or a trailer and there's a

822
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,000
lot of that going on I managed to do

823
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:32,399
that unath till

824
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,199
2015 by then um the band had started

825
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,599
having kids and we were no longer a band

826
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:39,279
but we still stay friendly so I just

827
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,079
kept my weed hustle going without the

828
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,960
guys of the music festival anymore so

829
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,440
long story short 2015 I caught the last

830
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,000
slick and uh that was on multiple

831
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,838
properties and they got me good there

832
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,679
was some seizure involved then and it

833
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:58,519
was the second so I caught I caught a

834
00:36:53,679 --> 00:37:00,960
Fed case in 2015 and uh I did over a

835
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:04,480
year for that one and uh they gave me an

836
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,000
ankle monitor but me being me I devised

837
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,119
the system where I knew I couldn't go

838
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,800
far enough to maintain plants because

839
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,960
they kept me to my driveway with the

840
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:18,400
monitor so me being me I got skid

841
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:22,599
pallets I put cures on them I joined two

842
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:26,079
together and I had a bamboo poles and

843
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:29,000
then there was um an ihawk that was that

844
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,880
big so thre a pulley s them I could put

845
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,838
and pull the skid pallets that had

846
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,838
buckets on them into heavy brass and

847
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,400
then I could pull them to me to maintain

848
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,920
them and that's how I had to grow and I

849
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,400
never got caught but I will tell you the

850
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,440
thing you're just like pulling them in

851
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,200
and out of the

852
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,400
garage no not the garage high high

853
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:52,279
brush oh my God High brush where the

854
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,200
driveway ended I put them in pulled them

855
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,319
out yep so it got it got pretty bad at

856
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,679
one point because they could visit

857
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:02,239
without any

858
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:05,118
notification and I remember that year I

859
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:09,039
had the horse dolls where my meter crop

860
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,039
was was drying to be harvested and uh it

861
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,599
also happened that two very large

862
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,960
vultures made a nest in

863
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,280
there so when the probation officer came

864
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,318
to visit he wanted to check all the out

865
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,480
buildings I let him check all but the

866
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:25,199
one and it must have been a blessing

867
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,519
from God because I said I'm not sure if

868
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,598
you want to go in there but you can but

869
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,239
there are two very big vultures in there

870
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,359
that are n which there were and it I

871
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:35,118
mean I couldn't have planned it any

872
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,679
better because as I said it they flew

873
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,640
from One Flew from the roof and he's

874
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,598
like yeah we're not doing that dude I'm

875
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:45,679
like splitting sausage links I'm sure my

876
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,640
kateed already was doing it and uh I got

877
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:51,519
away with it but

878
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:54,799
um it got too hot there so while still

879
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,880
on parole and probation for this I did

880
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,720
the baly move I contacted the probation

881
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,358
officer I said said look I'm going to

882
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,879
sell the Family Farm they left it to me

883
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:04,759
and uh I'm going to I'm going to head

884
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,880
out of here to Oklahoma where I can do

885
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,319
what I can

886
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,240
legally and uh he said yeah that

887
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:15,079
shouldn't be a problem um I'll run it

888
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:18,039
past probation and whatnot so famous

889
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:21,640
this H I've been here four years so it's

890
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:24,119
2024 now going on five so this was this

891
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:25,879
was just five years ago that you were

892
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,358
growing

893
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,760
illegally and had the ankle monitor yeah

894
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:34,519
cuz that story sounded like something

895
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,319
you were telling from a long time ago

896
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:40,838
well that's you

897
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:43,239
know no no no so what happened then then

898
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:46,719
got even crazier because

899
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:49,399
um I didn't anticipate it taking any

900
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:52,439
length of time to to leave to transfer

901
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,680
the probation or any any of that so this

902
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,559
is dur in the peak of covid and thank

903
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:58,358
God that probation wasn't even coming to

904
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,279
visit then

905
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:02,759
so I sold the property and had

906
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,839
everything in new halls and we're

907
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,560
staying in a hotel in the proban says uh

908
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,078
well have to go through what's called

909
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:15,960
interstate compact they need to transfer

910
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:18,160
it to Oklahoma and us not knowing that

911
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,159
uh it was going to take that long we

912
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,920
were trapped in a hotel for close to

913
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,519
four months at the peak of Co we were

914
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,720
terrified because nobody knew what was

915
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:29,239
going on then and we had a dog in toe so

916
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:32,159
uh we burned through 30 grand just

917
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:33,838
staying there paying the hotel and there

918
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,118
was nothing we could do about it and I

919
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:40,279
was told if we contact Oklahoma to see

920
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:43,079
if they accept us to move there um that

921
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,519
they would violate my probation so in

922
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,519
the last hour I risked it all and I

923
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,239
found out who the director of Interstate

924
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:53,559
Compact was and I was able to call and

925
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:56,000
we were able to get through and and move

926
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:58,358
but uh wow that's how it happened and I

927
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,679
was shocked that Oklahoma let me get a

928
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:05,039
commercial license while fill on

929
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:07,719
paper I me that's pretty great I agree

930
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,159
and even more remarkable was the

931
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:12,799
outpouring of genetics from people that

932
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,559
I did not even ask because in order to

933
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,640
keep my sanity I kind of made a little

934
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,119
blog on Instagram while we were stuck in

935
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,879
the hotel and everybody was caring for

936
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,720
us waiting for us to get there because

937
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,880
we were losing our [ __ ] I'll be honest

938
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,919
pardon my French we were we were losing

939
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,680
our mind during that that procedure not

940
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,000
knowing

941
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:34,358
uh if we could leave or not it's being

942
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,800
you know rendered lost in that hotel so

943
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,719
there was a big outpouring from the

944
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,920
community which I I still can't thank

945
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:43,439
anyone enough with all kinds of genetics

946
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,200
and love and wellwith is and all so we

947
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,760
finally made it did you lose a lot of

948
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:51,358
genetics in the

949
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:55,160
transition that's a good story yeah not

950
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:57,239
all of them um I had to go through

951
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,960
hospice with my mother before we did the

952
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:02,439
transition and move and sell the

953
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,199
property and um he might have known I

954
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,000
was in trouble and meant well but there

955
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:09,000
was there was a vault that I had in the

956
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,318
CER band that she definitely threw out

957
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,599
and I don't hold it against her she was

958
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,279
looking out for me probably thinking I

959
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:16,240
shouldn't have them there and all that

960
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,960
so yeah there was there was a lot in

961
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:21,598
there sure um what's what's the longest

962
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,760
uh like mother you've been able to keep

963
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:28,800
around through all your different uh

964
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:32,200
travels and excursions and

965
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,240
police interactions police interventions

966
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:36,639
police police

967
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:40,318
interactions um that's a good question

968
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:43,679
probably oh an air fell out

969
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,519
um the dg4 is one of them it's not super

970
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:49,519
old but I was able to keep that since

971
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:54,239
getting it from from I mag that's one um

972
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:58,559
the ndn guy G13 hack plant um I've had

973
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:01,679
around probably since um

974
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,640
early 2000s those would be my oldest um

975
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:07,279
some of them people have copied them for

976
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:09,440
me that I trust so I I couldn't get them

977
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,559
here so I was able to get some of those

978
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,159
back so that really doesn't count that

979
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,280
counts that's what the communities for

980
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,318
yeah yeah yes in a non-legal state it

981
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,280
really took having someone you could

982
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:24,159
trust to have backups for then and

983
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,079
that's how I think prohibition a lot of

984
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,598
the Legacy cuts for law during then

985
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,280
because a friend means as well and then

986
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,838
you know what it's like when you

987
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,400
sometimes let your friends watch your

988
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,039
garden when you get when you go away

989
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,838
when you're Sil small scale never ends

990
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:38,880
good sure we've all had a horror story

991
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:40,400
like

992
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,760
that

993
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,119
so yeah those would be the oldest but

994
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,520
some of them were were older that have

995
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,400
been held by people that have gotten

996
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:50,960
back to me and uh I have a crap memory I

997
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,680
can't even remember off the top of my

998
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,599
head I know I have a list of uh what

999
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,399
clones were introducing to Grateful

1000
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,119
heads

1001
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,720
okay and one of

1002
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:05,519
them yeah one of them is um the lavender

1003
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:08,159
cut which came from 90s s seed stock

1004
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,838
that's that's a great one we're excited

1005
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:13,960
to get some of those to the Mass's szo

1006
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:17,838
gen Cuts nice so one thing I wanted to

1007
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,800
say is part of the reason why I'm trying

1008
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:24,000
to get people to document their stories

1009
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:27,119
is because we're all forgetting you know

1010
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,679
so you know stories from 30 years ago

1011
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:34,240
are hard to you know to tell people we

1012
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,318
didn't have notes you know I mean you

1013
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:39,199
have a VHS

1014
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:41,239
tape I'm like at the edge of my seat I

1015
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,000
really want to see that you know

1016
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:47,358
because but uh yeah the whole purpose of

1017
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,358
of telling your story is so that it's

1018
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:53,799
documented for eternity you know

1019
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,558
and so I'm glad that you're telling you

1020
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,839
a story yeah I'm I'm pretty certain with

1021
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,960
today's technology that can be um

1022
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:02,239
converted to disc I should look into

1023
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,838
that I think I'm going to make that a

1024
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:09,399
priority you really do it soon because

1025
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:12,679
tape loses quality it's not

1026
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,240
digital I didn't even think of that well

1027
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,399
even if I have to pay out to have

1028
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,919
somebody do forensic retrieval I don't

1029
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,400
think it's a stretch because we have

1030
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,240
that technology today at worst worst

1031
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,680
possible

1032
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:25,759
scenario that's I mean I know a little

1033
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,719
something about this you know when the

1034
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,480
tape is damaged

1035
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:34,399
there's no recovering it oh okay because

1036
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,119
this is like if you have a painting and

1037
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,119
you chip off some of the paint you know

1038
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,559
like maybe somebody else could paint up

1039
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,880
you know so really you just need to go

1040
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,680
do that right away is have that video

1041
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,119
digitized and then you know once it's

1042
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:51,838
digitized it lasts forever but when you

1043
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,358
have actual tape up like I'll give you

1044
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:57,039
an example and I I know you're a dead

1045
00:45:54,358 --> 00:46:00,838
head and a fish head but like old

1046
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:03,599
cassette tapes after a while they're no

1047
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:09,239
good anymore and and VHS is kind of the

1048
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:13,079
same thing for for video so it's a MAG

1049
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:15,598
you know I'm I'm eight track

1050
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,519
old I had eight tracks

1051
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,240
too yeah yeah parents did you know

1052
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:22,599
that's going to be a priority that'll be

1053
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,679
uh real cool to share and get that done

1054
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:27,039
so that's definitely going to happen and

1055
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:29,318
uh it'll validate some of this stuff too

1056
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:32,039
in video format you can only say so much

1057
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:34,239
in words and then that way that's locked

1058
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,920
Forever at a frozen moment in time like

1059
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,959
you had

1060
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:43,920
said yeah so so you get out to Oklahoma

1061
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,400
in uh what 2020 and uh like what uh

1062
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,800
what's your first moves once you get to

1063
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,559
Oklahoma do you have a property or like

1064
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,480
a you get your you said you get a

1065
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,720
license tell us moreart the first the

1066
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,719
first move was

1067
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,239
um getting the license which happened

1068
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:01,959
seamlessly um I was able to have

1069
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:06,118
somebody who already had a license put

1070
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:08,039
me on there or um om really CRA down and

1071
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:13,440
everything we had minimal visits from

1072
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:18,400
omma um we weren't huge as a 30 by2

1073
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:20,480
shop with um a 40 lighter and five acres

1074
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,000
of outdoor was what we first started at

1075
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,760
and boy I get an education in a new

1076
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,639
climate because I thought I had done my

1077
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,559
breeding on the humid East Coast until I

1078
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:32,239
came to a river bottom in

1079
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,359
Oklahoma and uh for being completely

1080
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:37,199
honest and I people should share their

1081
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:40,318
failures too my first uh outdoor crop I

1082
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,960
would say was 80% loss if I'm being

1083
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,960
honest and

1084
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,639
because there was all different kinds of

1085
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,519
viroids and fungus here that I never

1086
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:51,318
encountered on the E Coast so it was a

1087
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:56,039
learning curve um we got set up right

1088
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:58,838
away and I think my first legal fail um

1089
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,480
was Indiana Indiana bubble gum in fact

1090
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:01,759
it was our first legal sale we were

1091
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,838
really proud of it but what did I do

1092
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,559
when I first got there you and I

1093
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:06,920
decompressed from the trauma that

1094
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:09,480
happened man we

1095
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,639
were nobody knew what was going on with

1096
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,400
covid we were seeing people outside in

1097
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:17,719
in Hazmat who tting testing the septic

1098
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,639
for the hotel wow and uh it it was a

1099
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:22,480
scary time because and I'm by no means

1100
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,118
politicizing this people do they get

1101
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,800
weird about Co but that's not what we're

1102
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:29,838
doing we didn't know what it was so it

1103
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,480
added that Fear Factor and uh there was

1104
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,480
nothing we could do about it so there

1105
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,159
was that anxiety because we were told by

1106
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,679
Pennsylvania probation if we contact to

1107
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:40,440
see the status of our transferral that

1108
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:42,919
they would violate me and I did it

1109
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,838
anyway so it took a long time I think

1110
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,480
I'm just now getting decompressed over

1111
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:49,639
that trauma to be if for being honest

1112
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,400
that took a while um but so good to be

1113
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:54,118
out of the sh it was weird for me

1114
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,838
because we know wectors weed was on a

1115
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,280
Polaroid you didn't share that [ __ ] with

1116
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:00,920
anybody now everyone like duck face

1117
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,040
selfie look at yeah here's the crop so

1118
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,760
that that was weird and there was even

1119
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:10,679
when in when legal some paranoia from

1120
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:15,319
path uh posting stuff it was alien to

1121
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:17,639
me yeah abely man the place that that I

1122
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:21,000
live man it's not it's still like you

1123
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:23,400
said nobody takes selfies with those

1124
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,639
things you oh my god daddy was telling

1125
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,240
me you can grow a plant of flower but

1126
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:31,358
you can't yeah yeah it's like you know

1127
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:33,279
um the facility where I have my library

1128
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:36,358
yeah it's in Austria and Austria has a

1129
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,519
law that is uh written like this you

1130
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:41,639
know the Delta 9 THC is the drug which

1131
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,920
is forbidden of course right it's it's

1132
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:48,679
the drug right so but cannabis is not a

1133
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:52,119
drug it's a plant and they uh have in

1134
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:55,239
law they have written down that the the

1135
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:58,240
plant itself is not a drug until it not

1136
00:49:55,239 --> 00:50:02,118
producing the substance you know you

1137
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:05,239
know what I mean yeah so after and the

1138
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:09,160
action of cutting a bot from the from

1139
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:12,719
the plant is producing drugs not growing

1140
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:15,519
it you know so actually if you don't uh

1141
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:18,399
if you would not have anything uh no no

1142
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,920
dry flowers at home and they will have a

1143
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,280
police raate you will have uh flowering

1144
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,280
plant outside your house nobody would

1145
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,680
actually I mean the the judge would uh

1146
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,160
free you in the end actually because you

1147
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,239
are not producing

1148
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:34,639
drugs it's aroma therapy you would claim

1149
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:36,879
you know it's very very different right

1150
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:39,558
I mean the system works like this the

1151
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,798
the government has taxes from that uh

1152
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:45,160
they you can sell it as a producer as an

1153
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:48,039
ornamental plant uh cannabis ornamental

1154
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:50,399
plants which I as a producer sell to

1155
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:52,519
other shops too and to many businesses

1156
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,599
and for example I've been contacted by

1157
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:57,838
Swiss uh pharmaceutical company just few

1158
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,519
weeks ago who who have a license to

1159
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:03,000
produce high THC potent

1160
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:06,239
flowers uh and also there is uh in

1161
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,199
Germany this kind of uh companies for

1162
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:11,118
years already which I contacted me uh

1163
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,558
but now in Germany is a legal Market you

1164
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:17,240
can sell to a private grower so you know

1165
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,798
but still it is only opening up right

1166
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:21,919
now you know you talk about something

1167
00:51:18,798 --> 00:51:25,000
that will be here in 10 years maybe you

1168
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,318
know always the always the hurdles and

1169
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,239
bureaucratic red tape I think it's time

1170
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:31,318
time to free the weed and anyone being

1171
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:33,639
persecuted for it it's a victim of crime

1172
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:36,119
it's just yeah it's tragic and it still

1173
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:39,318
feels like and it sounds like it it's

1174
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:43,039
still prohibition era for Austria it's

1175
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:45,798
so that sounds so convoluted yeah yeah

1176
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,639
it is like um it is like a little bit of

1177
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:51,159
taboo everybody knows about it and

1178
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:53,719
nobody's really giving a [ __ ] about it

1179
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:56,679
in that sense like until you're caught

1180
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:58,558
and when they are caught you know like I

1181
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:01,759
a producer when somebody comes to me and

1182
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:04,839
buys five plants and he goes out of my

1183
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,480
shop and I give him the bill that means

1184
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:11,078
I I sold you the car yeah so I'm a I'm a

1185
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,880
car seller so you have to be 18 years

1186
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:16,480
old you have to have a li permit uh for

1187
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,079
for driving and so you buy this car and

1188
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,039
you drive away you make a you uh make an

1189
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:24,760
accident and who is now you know I mean

1190
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:27,440
you're the one who is responsible not me

1191
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,440
you know I just sold you the plan and on

1192
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,920
the bill is written that you have to

1193
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,280
keep it on 18 hour of lights that means

1194
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,039
that is in you keep it under vegetation

1195
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,240
that it's not producing drugs you know

1196
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:42,039
that that is written on the bill yeah

1197
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:44,959
it's ornamental you know yeah and so in

1198
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:48,159
essence that's a waiver of releas yeah a

1199
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,079
waiver of release of responsibility yeah

1200
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,199
wow well at least it's a glimmer of hope

1201
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:55,160
head in the right direction um

1202
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:57,118
unfortunately my only experience with

1203
00:52:55,159 --> 00:53:00,078
gentleman that was an austri

1204
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,720
looked like this we got all the bells

1205
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:06,680
and whistles for a very large seed order

1206
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:09,239
we did the insurance we did the uh the

1207
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:10,960
the expedited delivery and I think that

1208
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:14,159
was counterproductive because it drew

1209
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,480
more attention and it was flagged in

1210
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:19,920
Austria and it didn't get through but it

1211
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,519
was never any any official thing from

1212
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,798
them other than they could do nothing

1213
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:27,480
for us so it was it it was a huge order

1214
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:29,440
what I did in good faith was

1215
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,719
I took the loss on it just to get them

1216
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,720
there he had a friend in Chicago who was

1217
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:35,439
receiving the seeds and then however he

1218
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:38,000
was getting them to Austria ended up

1219
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,679
happening but yeah that's reinforcing

1220
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,400
how tight it is there because it was

1221
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:44,719
listed as art

1222
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,720
supplies and they they allowed us to

1223
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,199
have another claim again to try to get

1224
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:50,558
it back and we haven't heard anything

1225
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:52,118
about it so I'm hoping they got them

1226
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,960
there because we were super pumped about

1227
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:56,880
getting some some of our strains to

1228
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,440
Austria yeah actually it's the system is

1229
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,640
there and I think I already talk about

1230
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,960
it in the last podcast how the system

1231
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:07,519
here works and uh it will be uh from

1232
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,119
year to year uh easier to do it because

1233
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,838
uh um many many other countries will

1234
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:15,440
will now decriminalize if I say Germany

1235
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:19,199
legalized it's wrong actually they

1236
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:22,159
decriminalized it right now thecriminal

1237
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:24,439
yeah it's not legalization it's it's

1238
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:26,639
it's just like you know it's really

1239
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,679
still really strict you know but they

1240
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,440
can grow now at home which they couldn't

1241
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:32,719
before and you know that's a really big

1242
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,240
difference right I mean it's a ray of

1243
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,798
light anyway it's headed in the right

1244
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:40,239
direction you know the fact you can

1245
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:42,559
shipped to Germany is is amazing yeah

1246
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,399
for example it is crazy for me when

1247
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,720
Gabby told me that you cannot ship

1248
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,039
between States you know in America the

1249
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:53,159
Clones that is crazy well you can ship

1250
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:54,679
we issue cultures worldwide if they're

1251
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:58,000
under a certain height because it's

1252
00:54:54,679 --> 00:55:02,960
considered H considered .3 just saying

1253
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:06,159
that if it doesn't flow it's it has no

1254
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,039
drugs yeah so there's a a loophole in

1255
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:12,838
the farm bill here where if it doesn't

1256
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:16,039
contain THC it's considered hemp and so

1257
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:17,358
clones can be shipped every everywhere

1258
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:19,719
through the country what I was telling

1259
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,798
you was it was something about a

1260
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:26,038
licensed cannabis Nursery is not allowed

1261
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:28,599
to sell clones to the public it only

1262
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:32,559
allows to sell clones

1263
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:35,559
to um a cultivator or a distributor that

1264
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:38,160
then grows it or to a dispensary which

1265
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:41,200
then can sell to the public but if for

1266
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:44,838
example the generation zero zero clones

1267
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:47,399
that uh uh you're producing right uh

1268
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:49,960
with with a grateful Head LCC company

1269
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,639
now this will be certified for example

1270
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:55,559
for my facility I have a passport also

1271
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:56,960
I'm under under uh watch of the food and

1272
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,240
Rock administ

1273
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,358
to do an import of that because you

1274
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:05,199
already have it from from tissue culture

1275
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:07,598
meric you have you have it from it's a

1276
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:10,399
gene zero it's little bit acclim

1277
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:12,440
acclimatized as I think you know uh but

1278
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,760
it still needs care but it can be

1279
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,000
shipped in one day you know this can go

1280
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,599
through it's like this is also a signal

1281
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,400
to all Europe now for for this you know

1282
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:25,960
that generation zero is the next big

1283
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:29,599
thing and also because we can trust you

1284
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:32,440
know can you describe generation

1285
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,559
zero I am not claiming to be super

1286
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,599
well-versed I I know enough to be

1287
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:41,079
dangerous but um I think probably Sasha

1288
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:43,280
could describe exactly in proper context

1289
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:46,200
what n zero is I think I don't claim to

1290
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,000
be an expert in tissue culture Protocol

1291
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:50,118
no it's I'm not an expert too maybe

1292
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,838
Cosmic would tell the story now if it's

1293
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:55,880
here uh I don't think he I mean

1294
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:59,440
basically gen zero means it's the first

1295
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:02,280
gener ation has come out of invit the

1296
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,400
mar stem culture that's Mar stem culture

1297
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,480
has to be there for a long time right I

1298
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,798
mean I heard some podcast that the

1299
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,599
maryem should be uh like at least two

1300
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:15,798
years in in

1301
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:19,680
maryem um no marem noal again marem noal

1302
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:21,400
in this form and then after these two

1303
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,480
years it should be introduced all

1304
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,000
because viruses or this kind of

1305
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:29,838
pathogens they cannot survive that that

1306
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,838
kind long time as a as a parasitic uh uh

1307
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:35,838
element in the plant right I mean uh if

1308
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:37,759
you have it for 2 years in the chamber

1309
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,558
and repeat the process and have it in

1310
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,880
and then introducing it as first time

1311
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:46,599
you know from uh Mar stem to noal from

1312
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,440
noal to to rooting and from rooting to

1313
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:51,838
to to a hardening phase where the Gen

1314
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,960
zero becomes the Gen zeroc clone it

1315
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:55,920
starts to grow a little bit you

1316
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,199
acclimatize it first you need hoods then

1317
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,200
you need without hoods I mean Gabby says

1318
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:04,358
you need don't need hoods but it's like

1319
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:07,038
just the as you would do traditional

1320
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:08,880
mother plant cuttings you know you start

1321
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,839
with the hoods and then you acclimatize

1322
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,039
it you know and then you put it under

1323
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:16,239
the stronger lights and then after weeks

1324
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:19,599
and from these plants you know from

1325
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:23,598
generation zero plants if somebody has a

1326
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:27,280
little uh lap you know can do uh mother

1327
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,838
plants quick and make no Cuts so you

1328
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,599
have noal already from those kind of

1329
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:35,159
plants and you you still keep it in your

1330
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:37,039
Li Library you know that is my the big

1331
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:39,519
thing my the idea that for me would be

1332
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:43,079
so interesting I would definitely buy

1333
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:44,759
this kind of genetics in the future from

1334
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:48,559
yeah

1335
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:51,640
y hom grower will make a mom and will

1336
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:53,880
keep it uh really clean and he will

1337
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:56,358
never get any diseases then you know

1338
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,160
never let me say it's it's a good start

1339
00:58:56,358 --> 00:59:00,719
you know it's one of it's better start

1340
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:03,759
than we have now you know and the the

1341
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:06,959
the other thing um is I have a personal

1342
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:11,680
relationship my very best friend

1343
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:14,440
designed Ed one of the first modular TC

1344
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:16,558
Labs that that he's making available and

1345
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,880
he's working out of the University of

1346
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:22,720
Tennessee tissue culture

1347
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,680
program um so there's any Synergy there

1348
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,879
that that's going to be a worldwide

1349
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:28,078
operation um

1350
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,880
modular

1351
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:33,480
lab I need his phone number

1352
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:36,079
bro well let's we we can make this

1353
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:38,000
happen um he's my ve he's my very best

1354
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,400
friend he co-signed for the people he's

1355
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,719
working with and he's working with two

1356
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,760
phds in the in their lab um at the

1357
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:47,558
University of Tennessee they got they

1358
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,160
got some grant money they're very very

1359
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:51,920
gifted staff and they're giving me a

1360
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:53,719
craft education in it I don't I claim to

1361
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,318
have a rudimentary knowledge of what it

1362
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:58,199
does but I think the important thing

1363
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:00,318
about the f clones to mention is there

1364
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:03,639
will be restored Vigor with the older

1365
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:06,480
cuts it will do away with a lot of the

1366
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:09,199
genetic drift that will do away with the

1367
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,440
full panel of pathogens and viroids and

1368
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:15,719
that's something really important

1369
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:18,599
because hlvd fusarium moso tobacco are

1370
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:22,358
starting to run rampant in our industry

1371
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:24,760
and that being said I think mother rooms

1372
01:00:22,358 --> 01:00:26,239
are going to be obsolete within 5 to8

1373
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:29,119
years and I think the thing that we're

1374
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:32,159
going to start seeing next is cryogenic

1375
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:35,358
storage where we can store millions of

1376
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:37,118
plantlets at scale in a very small area

1377
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,639
I think that that's going to eventually

1378
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:43,119
make mother rooms obsolete because as we

1379
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:45,279
know has your company been able to take

1380
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,760
um like meristematic tissue culture or

1381
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:51,880
other tissue culture out of cryogenic

1382
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:54,079
freeze um the company that I'm working

1383
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:57,400
with grateful heads I can't speak on

1384
01:00:54,079 --> 01:01:00,000
because I I just have introdu

1385
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,838
um to the the uh Their scientist who's

1386
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,679
doing it that the other company where my

1387
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:09,400
friend is building labs for them has

1388
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:11,199
they also can and haven't delve into

1389
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,960
another controversial topic which is

1390
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:16,279
crisper editing because there's another

1391
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,559
misconception about that technology I'm

1392
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,079
not an advocate of it nor am I opposed

1393
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,720
to it it's still Discovery for me

1394
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:26,519
there's a common

1395
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:28,000
misconception that it's GMO and it's not

1396
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:30,719
because if you understand the simple

1397
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,960
concept of GMO it's introducing a

1398
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:35,838
foreign entity to an already existing

1399
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,079
cellular structure so we're talking

1400
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:41,599
about crisper crisper is in essence the

1401
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:44,039
giant pair of molecular scissors that's

1402
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,039
adding the same organical plant material

1403
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:48,720
from within the plant source that it was

1404
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:51,400
derived from so they're they're doing

1405
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:53,358
stuff there um I I haven't done anything

1406
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,318
with my cannabis genetics there I'm a

1407
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:58,400
I'm a brand ambassador for their CBD

1408
01:01:55,318 --> 01:02:02,199
product but uh any other Lab Services

1409
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,519
there are offered to me you know so and

1410
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:04,919
uh there's not really a conflict of

1411
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,159
interest because my genetics are going

1412
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,440
to Grateful heads that's a separate

1413
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:11,639
entity in

1414
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:14,400
itself yeah talk about grateful

1415
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:16,118
heads super excited to be on there man

1416
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,240
and I'll be totally honest a lot of the

1417
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:21,318
guys that are on the board legal they're

1418
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:23,239
like this and superheroes to me that

1419
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:26,079
you'd see and be like wow that's so

1420
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:27,798
awesome they're doing that so like my

1421
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,798
are still getting they're getting flued

1422
01:02:27,798 --> 01:02:31,838
just talking about it because I I'm

1423
01:02:29,798 --> 01:02:36,559
blown away and honored to be part of

1424
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:39,599
them um Kevin jod skun Craft medical

1425
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:42,680
everyone on the staff is great and I

1426
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,200
think it's uh Steve at craft medical did

1427
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:47,159
a great job picking the team because

1428
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,118
there's people that may not have a lot

1429
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:52,239
of followers that don't get the exposure

1430
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,680
but have a certain Talent he liked he he

1431
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,399
he kind of handpicked a really good a

1432
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:59,118
good group and we get the together for

1433
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,639
Google Zoom meets try to get together a

1434
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,640
couple times a month and just get our

1435
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:05,558
heads together so um I like the fact

1436
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:07,159
they're not all high-profile people I

1437
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:09,359
think that means a lot because we're

1438
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,960
we're going to build each other you know

1439
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:14,000
on that

1440
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,960
platform uh awesome and regarding my own

1441
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,039
genetic

1442
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:21,559
material um I'm going to be introducing

1443
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:23,640
them probably January 15th and I I can't

1444
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:25,400
believe I can't remember my my brain is

1445
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:28,318
over inundated with information right

1446
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,039
now list this morning you saw what I

1447
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:32,558
posted yeah you can run through that

1448
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:34,760
without without getting off the phone

1449
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,119
um that's just the start of what I'm

1450
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,240
going to incorporate I have a good bit

1451
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:40,400
of other things and it's also important

1452
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:43,798
to mention we were on the topic of Dutch

1453
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,760
genetics um over the years and being in

1454
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:48,759
Amsterdam I was able to forward some

1455
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,278
friendships with some of the Breeders

1456
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,880
there some old seed stock from some

1457
01:03:51,278 --> 01:03:54,798
people that are retired and that leads

1458
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,119
me into the next conversation where I

1459
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:59,838
think um embryo rescue protocol will be

1460
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:03,079
will be a thing as well and to get some

1461
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:07,278
of these um you know long lost cultivars

1462
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:09,760
back back to where they should be um jop

1463
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:11,358
from homegrown fantas seeds retired

1464
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,359
recently and he gifted me all his

1465
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:15,239
remaining

1466
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:17,838
stock um we have the original myy which

1467
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:20,959
is one of my all-time favorites we have

1468
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:23,318
um his cheese which one won the Cannabis

1469
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,240
Cup the H the Homegrown fantasies

1470
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:28,599
te's um they're super Crystal

1471
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:32,358
and a few others I can't oh white

1472
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:34,119
widow um we have those I'm not sure the

1473
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:36,400
viability but I think I'm going to save

1474
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:39,480
those and also

1475
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:43,680
um from Flying Dutchmen I got a lot of

1476
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:45,240
their old old remaining stock um yes I

1477
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,519
have a rora

1478
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:51,439
Bor have

1479
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:54,559
um God why can't I remember it now pot

1480
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,519
of gold which I have is a mother mother

1481
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,440
plant and Seed line separate from the

1482
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:00,000
older

1483
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:03,000
stock The Real McCoy that's the one I'm

1484
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,278
most excited about we we have that and

1485
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,358
uh a lot of people the early breeders

1486
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:11,079
used that same Hawaiian cut for a lot of

1487
01:05:08,358 --> 01:05:13,798
successful things I think stelma was one

1488
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:16,359
of them off the top of my head um and I

1489
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:18,079
think sensey may have used that Hawaiian

1490
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:21,000
IND in some of their crosses that makes

1491
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,278
up the Real McCoy so I'm excited to see

1492
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,358
what we can do because you got to

1493
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:27,960
remember if the sea doesn't pop it

1494
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:30,440
doesn't mean the cell embryo is dead and

1495
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:34,358
you know you can run them through that

1496
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,960
that uh protocol to regen to regenerate

1497
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:41,038
them some little primitive way would be

1498
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:45,720
using gibberelic acid right

1499
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:47,680
with exactly yeah I think Dave Dave uh

1500
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:50,239
Dave Pope AK Bean brains gave me the

1501
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:53,519
recipe for that that I've been afraid to

1502
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:56,159
do it you have to have the right PPM you

1503
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:59,038
know in the water you soak the sea

1504
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:02,000
yeah yeah if you uh if it's too high the

1505
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:05,680
PPM of of it then I think there is one

1506
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,199
guy called Vader on YouTube uh he has

1507
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:11,919
this uh

1508
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:14,278
um this seed company he's like having a

1509
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:17,599
know a YouTube channel for years already

1510
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:21,119
Vader OG is his name of the channel and

1511
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:23,960
he's uh said it few years ago that and

1512
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:26,640
he made an experiment also and you have

1513
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:29,358
it in YouTube uh he has the right PPM he

1514
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:32,199
has three cops with old seats like 20

1515
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:34,759
years old seats and uh first cup second

1516
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:38,239
cup third cup are with different ppms uh

1517
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:41,400
the third cup is without gilic acid and

1518
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:43,759
it's also the lowest uh uh rate of

1519
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,160
sprouting and the first two were

1520
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,520
sprouting really good actually 20y old

1521
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:51,480
seeds and he has gibberelic acid in form

1522
01:06:48,519 --> 01:06:55,599
of crystals which he adds I have it at

1523
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,599
home in the form of liquid

1524
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,199
uh you can go I I don't know from the

1525
01:06:58,838 --> 01:07:03,719
head you know if I will say something

1526
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:06,439
now it will be wrong but I it's Vader OG

1527
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:10,838
and uh Vader he's named of the breeder

1528
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:13,960

1563
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,319

01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:47,119
it you know you meet these kind of

1567
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:49,119
people like we are now on the podcast

1568
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:52,039
like who are so into it but that's why

1569
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:54,559
Barcelona for me is like the only place

1570
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:56,359
where I can go that I meet like-minded

1571
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,400
people in person

1572
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:00,440
because otherwise you cannot meet in

1573
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,759
person you we can meet overline online

1574
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:05,000
now like we do but you know the world is

1575
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:07,560
so small but actually we have points

1576
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,560
where we can meet you know like yeah

1577
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:14,159
it's it's crazy you know I'm I'm you

1578
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:17,000
know I I camaraderie the camaraderie I

1579
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:18,798
feel is what's needed again instead of

1580
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,719
people concerned with what everybody

1581
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:22,838
else is doing and all that stuff I feel

1582
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:25,039
like if you're honest and you grind hard

1583
01:09:22,838 --> 01:09:26,960
and you're consistent everybody has

1584
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:29,359
their own Lane there shouldn't be a

1585
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,439
competitive Vibe if you're talented

1586
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:34,159
there's enough for everybody to eat out

1587
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,919
there yes and it's so much easier I I

1588
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:37,838
get so mad I don't engage in public

1589
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,960
drama it hurts my heart even some

1590
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:43,158
high-profile people you'll see engaging

1591
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:45,920
in online drama about a strainer about

1592
01:09:43,158 --> 01:09:47,318
this and that and even if you're right

1593
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,880
that's going to be offputting to a

1594
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:52,640
potential friend or an end user so I

1595
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:54,640
just stay away from it man yeah the best

1596
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,960
thing is to be quiet about it and you

1597
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,560
know you don't need the drama uh for and

1598
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,800
you don't have you don't have the time

1599
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,440
in life for this drama because you have

1600
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,360
so much work right with the plans man I

1601
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:07,519
mean there is so much work to do even

1602
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:10,158
now that we are on the postcast man it

1603
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,360
is in the night now here but actually we

1604
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:13,920
do in the day like your time now I would

1605
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:16,399
have to go to the facility man I would

1606
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,039
be like guys I still have five 10

1607
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:19,879
minutes you know I have to go you know

1608
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:22,519
because you know what I mean this is my

1609
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,880
life this is like my babies everybody of

1610
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,080
us feel like this I hope so I mean I see

1611
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,359
it you know

1612
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:30,880
it's all day man and the one thing that

1613
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:33,519
struck me that I think is is helping our

1614
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,480
business model work out is a lot of

1615
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,360
these top readers you know you may grow

1616
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:39,238
their St for years and they're not

1617
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:41,119
really accessible and by all means

1618
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:43,959
everybody operates differently it's by

1619
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:46,599
means a knock on everybody and it's TR

1620
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:49,319
me if I'm ever gonna do this I'm gonna

1621
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:52,880
answer my phone I'm gonna answer every

1622
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:54,799
single message I can it's a redundant

1623
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,960
question from a noob who's just starting

1624
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,719
out that could be the most important

1625
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,239
question you're asked all day and you

1626
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:03,000
bet you're ass if I can get back to

1627
01:11:01,238 --> 01:11:06,079
everybody even if I'm ready to pull my

1628
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,039
hair out I'm going to do that because I

1629
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:10,800
I think the the human interactive part

1630
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:13,039
is really good and I think actually

1631
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,279
giving a [ __ ] enough to take the time

1632
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:17,079
goes a long way as a successful business

1633
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:19,359
model it's pretty much business

1634
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:22,920
101

1635
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:25,319
yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to do just

1636
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:28,000
that you know when I get a message on

1637
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:30,559
Instagram or on YouTube I try to respond

1638
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,960
to it respond to it quickly but I also

1639
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:36,400
do understand you know like um NATO dog

1644
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:45,960

1645
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:49,000

1646
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:52,600

01:11:55,639 --> 01:11:59,880
something it's it's

1650
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:02,599
just you know re realistically after a

1651
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:05,480
while it becomes overwhelming so for now

1652
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:08,159
while I can do it I try to do it I try

1653
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:10,759
to and you know what's great is that's

1654
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:14,359
how I met Sasha you know that's how I'm

1655
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:17,719
meeting other great people you know and

1656
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:20,319
you know one another great thing for me

1657
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:21,198
of about this podcast is I feel like I'm

1658
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:23,840
making

1659
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:27,158
friends you know

1660
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:29,840
and you know that's priceless that's

1661
01:12:27,158 --> 01:12:31,599
super important I can't emphasize the

1662
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,239
the importance of that enough because

1663
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,440
it's kind of lost out there everyone

1664
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:37,238
thinks they're competing yeah and I just

1665
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:39,479
see people competing with themselves and

1666
01:12:37,238 --> 01:12:42,959
their own egos there's really and the

1667
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:45,158
way I perceive life and I always have is

1668
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,800
there is no competition competition's a

1669
01:12:45,158 --> 01:12:49,319
a mental limitation because check it out

1670
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,320
there's always somebody that's going to

1671
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:54,679
be bigger better and faster than you so

1672
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:56,840
learn from the best and make it your own

1673
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:59,679
that's the old always the way I live my

1674
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:02,679
life pretty much well you want with

1675
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:05,399
yourself say that go ahead you want you

1676
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:08,600
want to compete with yourself exactly

1677
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:09,719
you know with your mind you can't do it

1678
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:14,480
yeah with your mind saying that you

1679
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:16,279
can't do it um my my lady she you know

1680
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,158
she works out a lot she tries to go to

1681
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:21,399
the gym every day I'm wearing gym rats

1682
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:23,439
for Life dude every day I'm trying I'm

1683
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:26,198
too busy this is this is my lady's uh

1684
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:28,759
gym and they had like a competition

1685
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:30,198
first of all so I I'm going to change

1686
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,600
the subject for a minute just for some

1687
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:35,759
light-hearted stuff but um do it so my

1688
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:39,520
lady goes to the gym every day I try to

1689
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:42,800
go I can't go as often and this gym is

1690
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:45,679
kind of geared towards women okay it's

1691
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,920
like you know mostly women that go there

1692
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:50,840
but you know guys are allowed

1693
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:53,319
and uh so I go there with them and they

1694
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,400
have this competition like it's like an

1695
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:58,920
actual weightlifting competition with it

1696
01:13:55,399 --> 01:14:00,158
doing all this different stuff and uh

1697
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,440
you know they asked me if I want to do

1698
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:06,599
it and the first answer is there's no

1699
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:09,919
way I want to do it because these women

1700
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,159
at this gym are [ __ ] badasses they're

1701
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,480
all

1702
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:16,759
like you know like so like it would just

1703
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:19,158
be and the other thing is the only

1704
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,920
person that I want to compete with is

1705
01:14:19,158 --> 01:14:24,519
myself right you know like I I just want

1706
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:27,520
to do better and I want to lose some

1707
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:30,639
weight you know may p on a little bit of

1708
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,880
muscle um but mostly lose my gut you

1709
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:36,279
know so I'm competing with myself when I

1710
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,039
go to the gym I'm not looking at like

1711
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:40,119
what the max weight that somebody else

1712
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:42,719
can bench presses or or anything like

1713
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:45,399
that what I'm looking at is you know how

1714
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:48,079
much more can I do this time you know to

1715
01:14:45,399 --> 01:14:51,479
push myself to be better and so that's

1716
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:54,198
why I said like I like competing with

1717
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:56,839
myself yeah well real real quick on that

1718
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:59,279
topic um

1719
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,760
I being sedentary and being on probation

1720
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,158
and not having a license because they

1721
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,480
take their license when I moved to

1722
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:08,679
Oklahoma I'd always stay lean you know

1723
01:15:05,479 --> 01:15:11,759
and just from being active so everyone

1724
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:16,079
fact on Co dude dude I went I walked

1725
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:18,440
around at 199 I'm 6'4 and 3 years later

1726
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:22,639
in Oklahoma I got up to uh

1727
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:25,319
254 I put much weight and uh this year I

1728
01:15:22,639 --> 01:15:26,880
lost it all and I got muscular again I

1729
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:28,759
didn't think it was possible my blood

1730
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,079
pressure went up I got scared I think

1731
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:34,079
that's what made me do it and I I

1732
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:36,039
dropped 54 lbs and the the main thing

1733
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:38,319
that made the weight shut off and lose

1734
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:39,800
my stomach and I I have a four pack I

1735
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:42,759
can't believe it I'm not going to show

1736
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:46,119
anybody that's to attack you but

1737
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:47,840
anyway I'm doing it now I'm doing it now

1738
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:52,559
which is the reason I'm bringing it up

1739
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:55,239
is uh I fast every Monday I I go to bed

1740
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,560
you know very early I go to bed at 8:

1741
01:15:55,238 --> 01:15:59,599
every night I'm up at 4:00 with the

1742
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:04,000
plant and uh every Monday I fast I don't

1743
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:07,239
eat until 7:00 on Monday and that's you

1744
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,960
know over 24 hours and uh then my meal

1745
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:11,359
is usually something very light it's

1746
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,800
fruit or something and that helped if

1747
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,880
you really want to get into it it's

1748
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,600
super hard because you're going to get

1749
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,560
irritable when you do it you might even

1750
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:21,719
have cramps or anything but we we

1751
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,360
consume as humans far more calories than

1752
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:25,880
we need and I really didn't figure it

1753
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:28,000
out until I I got into fat think so we

1754
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,400
we'll end on that note and I applaud you

1755
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,560
for your health Journey because our trip

1756
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:32,559
is

1757
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:38,760
short yeah you're you're right actually

1758
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:41,319
you know uh the older you get the more

1759
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,679
you feel the the body needs something

1760
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:45,880
else you know I mean the the culture

1761
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,639
here in my country is we eat quite a lot

1762
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:51,159
of meat right I mean also a lot of

1763
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:54,239
vegetables because we grow our own food

1764
01:16:51,158 --> 01:16:56,759
the quality of that food is quite High

1765
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:58,119
you know but in the last you know 20

1766
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,440
years of course there is a lot of

1767
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:04,439
supermarkets and you know the food gets

1768
01:17:00,439 --> 01:17:06,599
lower quality so people lost it is also

1769
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:08,238
cheaper so now people lost the feeling

1770
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:11,440
that you need to buy from a

1771
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:14,119
farmer you know somebody that is local

1772
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:17,759
here the food is not being D driven from

1773
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:19,519
Far places to your table right I mean

1774
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,639
the best thing is if you have all the

1775
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,239
food if you can from your local

1776
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:27,560
environment which is like radius of 100

1777
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:29,799
kilm you know that is great because it

1778
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:33,320
means people people who do that you know

1779
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:35,880
also we with people I say conab people

1780
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:38,759
when we do our end product the thing

1781
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:40,639
that is for us still here illegal to do

1782
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:44,480
but when I do my

1783
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:47,719
clones I want to be them the a quality a

1784
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:49,839
AA quality you know as I can do it you

1785
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:52,239
know I will not send them to Germany to

1786
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,600
a hom grower if there is no not really

1787
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:56,519
the best clone I can send to him I

1788
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,079
rather you know if I have older clones

1789
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:01,920
that is you know not the higher score I

1790
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:04,198
rather say hey I wait for the next round

1791
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,399
of the cut you know just to have the the

1792
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:09,158
best quality you know because the word

1793
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:12,238
spreads around if you if you uh

1794
01:18:09,158 --> 01:18:16,079
spreading uh your company will rise if

1795

1805
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:42,519
appreciated by the end

1806
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:46,559
users yeah something else I can add to

1807
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:51,120
that is I remember when I opened up uh

1808
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:54,039
the garden spout my my grow shop and

1809
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,599
within days of opening up my store we

1810
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:58,279
got a visit

1811
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:02,480
from the only other place in town that

1812
01:18:58,279 --> 01:19:05,759
you could buy any gross stuff okay so I

1813
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:07,879
I opened up the first indoor grow shop

1814
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,440
but there was a store and still exists

1815
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:15,560
called Spare Time Supply and Spare Time

1816
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:19,198
Supply they saw sold soil and pots and

1817
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:21,880
fertilizer all kinds of fertilizer okay

1818
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:25,238
and then in a ocean container in the

1819
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:27,760
back it had grow lights so it was like a

1820
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:30,079
regular Nursery but it was in mesino

1821
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,440
County right so the clients there wanted

1822
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:35,559
to buy stuff to grow weed in but they

1823
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:38,079
tried to keep it like lowkey right when

1824
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:41,719
I opened up my store and it my store was

1825
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:44,479
based for the indoor grower I had grow

1826
01:19:41,719 --> 01:19:46,439
lights in the window shining up the

1827
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,718
highway like you couldn't drive through

1828
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:49,839
Willets without seeing high pressure

1829
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:55,000
sodium

1830
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:57,880
lights so I quickly got a visit from the

1831
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,319
son of the store owner and at first I

1832
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,800
didn't know who he was and he's just

1833
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:05,079
asking me some questions and I'm all

1834
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:08,840
excited I got my store open and he says

1835
01:20:05,079 --> 01:20:11,719
well my name is Mike I'm from Sparetime

1836
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:15,679
Supply and we're going to put you out of

1837
01:20:11,719 --> 01:20:20,000
business oh fighting words right he felt

1838
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:22,560
he felt very threatened by it but you

1839
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,920
know he didn't put me out of

1840
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:29,039
business and you know they had a

1841
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:31,039
wholesale company too and eventually

1842
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:33,039
they started selling me stuff like

1843
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:35,158
selling me the soil cuz I could buy it

1844
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:37,359
from someone else but they were local

1845
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:39,079
and it was easy I could just pick it up

1846
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:41,279
instead of having pallets of soil

1847
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:43,198
delivered so it was

1848
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:46,759
cheaper

1849
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:48,879
and you know I think eventually they

1850
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,840
realized yeah you know he's taking some

1851
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:54,800
of our business but he's also bringing

1852
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:56,520
me some business and you know what what

1853
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,360
they realized is they had to step up

1854
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,000
their

1855
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:03,479
game okay like if they wanted to Market

1856
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,238
to the indoor Growers they had to take

1857
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:08,439
the [ __ ] out of the ocean container in

1858
01:21:05,238 --> 01:21:10,319
the back and they did you know at that

1859
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:11,839
point they had the grow lights right up

1860
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:16,279
front center and they even grew some

1861
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:17,400
plants and so like I feel like I had a

1862
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:22,279
positive

1863
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:25,599
influence even on them right and then

1864
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:27,960
other stores started to pop up

1865
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:31,039
and honestly a few of them were like my

1866
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:33,600
former clients the two bigger stores

1867
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:36,719
that opened up these guys used to be my

1868
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:39,199
clients but you know I

1869
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:42,600
remembered the spare time thing them

1870
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:46,559
coming to my store and and threatening

1871
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:47,880
me right and you know when they told me

1872
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,080
they were doing it I was like well

1873
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:52,920
congratulations you know like like let's

1874
01:21:51,079 --> 01:21:55,479
go into this as friendly

1875
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:58,199
competition okay let's both try to make

1876
01:21:55,479 --> 01:22:01,079
each other do a better job we don't want

1877
01:21:58,198 --> 01:22:03,399
the bad type of competition where the

1878
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:07,000
customer can work us against each

1879
01:22:03,399 --> 01:22:08,839
other right you know so like he would

1880
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,399
call me up and say hey this guy says

1881
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,400
you're selling him the lights for 400

1882
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:15,158
bucks is that true and I'd say yeah and

1883
01:22:13,399 --> 01:22:18,198
he'd say okay I'm just going to match

1884
01:22:15,158 --> 01:22:20,000
the price that's what we would do like

1885
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:23,039
we wouldn't beat the other guy's price

1886
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,600
we'd match the price and so if you want

1887
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:27,359
to shop with me because you appreciate

1888
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,400
the service that I'm doing then you shop

1889
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,479
with me if you want to shop with him you

1890
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:36,559
can shop with him but it's not going to

1891
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:38,919
be about price and you know well good

1892
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:41,639
there's something to be said for good

1893
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:44,880
but the whole idea I think what I was

1894
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:46,480
trying to get at is when we were talking

1895
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,719
about

1896
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:54,198
competition okay competition can make

1897
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:56,319
you elevate your game and not be lazy

1898
01:22:54,198 --> 01:22:59,279
you you know so

1899
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:00,399
competition can be a good thing if

1900
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:04,719
you're not

1901
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:07,000
lazy now that's that's a good point yeah

1902
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:10,079
I do want to say that there can be bad

1903
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,679
competition to okay eventually what

1904
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:16,880
happened here was there was some big

1905
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:20,119
corporate owned Grow shops that owned

1906
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:22,679
like tons of Grow shops throughout the

1907
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:25,359
country and what they did was they

1908
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:28,520
started targeting areas

1909
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:30,639
and they sold products for like cheaper

1910
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:33,360
than I could get it for certainly

1911
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:36,000
cheaper than what I could sell it for

1912
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:38,198
and you know they put basically all the

1913
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,000
independently owned Grow shops out of

1914
01:23:38,198 --> 01:23:43,158
business

1915
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,520
so what I want to say is there's good

1916
01:23:43,158 --> 01:23:47,759
competition and there's bad competition

1917
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,480
you know but overall you should always

1918
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:55,600
try to make the competition make you

1919
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:57,839
elevate your game Fact you know y so and

1920
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,280
it's good you had a healthy camaraderie

1921
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:03,000
amid the uh the competitive nature

1922
01:24:00,279 --> 01:24:05,119
that's good you turned it around you

1923
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,399
know that's what I love about the

1924
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:11,760
grateful Head project you know the

1925
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:15,119
you're your that so many great heads

1926
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:17,119
came together you know that's that's you

1927
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:20,519
know that's the thing I think this is

1928
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:23,000
the game changer now globally because

1929
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,719
you have to understand not only for you

1930
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,158
this is a new thing because you are a to

1931
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,198
it now but in Europe and all around the

1932
01:24:27,158 --> 01:24:31,679
world people know about it you know like

1933
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:34,359
in South Africa is a legal Market in

1934
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:36,359
Uruguay is a legal Market in you know

1935
01:24:34,359 --> 01:24:38,839
many parts of the world already there is

1936
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:41,279
legal market and they will want to have

1937
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:45,719
these genetics you know for somebody to

1938
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:48,000
have like a true cut of KD you know from

1939
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:50,359
Europe or South Africa this is like wo

1940
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,719
you know this is for us cuz I don't know

1941
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:55,319
anybody that would have a true Kim de

1942
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:59,520
cot you know we have hybrids you know

1943
01:24:55,319 --> 01:25:02,079
you have yeah because I I s's lavender I

1944
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,199
can tell you the back story on those

1945
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:09,600
that came from a gentleman in Yuba City

1946
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:12,678
California who got 90 Selma stock and he

1947
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,639
did a pheno hunt and he selected that

1948
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:16,719
cut from the best 23 females that he got

1949
01:25:15,639 --> 01:25:19,118
from that

1950
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,840
stock and that's what I know about the

1951
01:25:19,118 --> 01:25:22,719
backstory of that I can tell you a

1952
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:24,639
little bit

1953
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:27,800
about I can tell you a a little bit

1954
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:31,840
about the plant the lavender cut

1955
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:34,600
has floral lavender turps with a back a

1956
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:37,319
back end that's not unlike real opium if

1957
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:40,920
you've ever experienced it so the first

1958
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:44,279
the first initial um hit to the palette

1959
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:46,279
would be like lavender aroma therapy and

1960
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:48,679
then that gives way to something a

1961
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:50,079
little more complex which is a spice not

1962
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:53,840
unlike

1963
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:58,079
opium and that plant is finished and no

1964
01:25:53,840 --> 01:26:00,279
later than 53 days I've grown two three

1965
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:02,800
foot long Louisville Sluggers in really

1966
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:05,880
bad Seasons outside without a spe of

1967
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:08,279
mold outcross is like a champ the

1968
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:11,000
branches on it it's a very tight to

1969
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:13,118
itself plant so it's it needs topping

1970
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,560
but the branches on it are like Lumber

1971
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:20,039
it's absolutely insane prehistoric fans

1972
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:22,600
very tight internodal growth and um it's

1973
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:24,840
more potent than the named purple cuts

1974
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:28,440
that I've encountered which would be a

1975
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:30,360
berry um granddaddy purple purple Urkel

1976
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:32,799
none of them are slouches in the potency

1977
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:35,559
department but I think there's higher

1978
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:38,079
LOLOL count in my lavender cut and

1979
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:40,520
that's the other thing about it um that

1980
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:44,600
and the alcross is are my wife and I

1981
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:46,679
goto for anxiety and for sleep and not

1982
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,119
to be too graphic but I've heard reports

1983
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:52,600
that it's good for women's monthly woes

1984
01:26:49,118 --> 01:26:54,479
as well yeah this sounds a lot like this

1985
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:56,159
sounds a lot like the lavender that mad

1986
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:58,759
uses is it the same

1987
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:00,759
cut no I have a lot of respect for him

1988
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,920
it looks along the same lines but it's

1989
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,719
definitely not the same cut different

1990
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:08,840
sources shout out to mad family good

1991
01:27:05,719 --> 01:27:11,000
people in Oklahoma now oh awesome yeah

1992
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,560
so that's a little about that um let's

1993
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,399
see how bad my memory is so the next one

1994
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:19,119
I

1995
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:21,599
have pot of gold mother from feed pop of

1996
01:27:19,118 --> 01:27:24,639
Old Stock which would make it an F3 I

1997
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:27,000
have that mother and then I have a 90 St

1998
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,639
clone that uh somebody was kind enough

1999
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,479
to gift to me so there's two different

2000
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:33,520
things there I'll go down them and when

2001
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:36,118
I my memory doesn't serve me how about

2002
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:40,000
you ad lib I'll go down the ones I

2003
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:43,759
remember all right I thought so pot of

2004
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:47,520
gold is from um 90 stock Flying Dutchman

2005
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:51,000
it's skunk one times Hindu C and that's

2006
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:53,719
a plant that finishes in about 63 days

2007
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,960
and it makes uh dense golf ball type

2008
01:27:53,719 --> 01:27:59,039
structure of the plant and the turps I

2009
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:02,960
would describe as a skunk family and an

2010
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:05,880
apple orchard it's got very mated notes

2011
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:09,520
to it it's almost like the first toke

2012
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:11,199
off off a bowl is um almost like a thin

2013
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:14,280
mint I'm not going to stay cookies but

2014
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:17,118
it has that that mtila mouth feel to it

2015
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:19,399
and then as you exhale it's like burnt

2016
01:28:17,118 --> 01:28:21,599
rubber intermingling with skunk with

2017
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:24,839
with the back note of Apple on it that's

2018
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:26,480
the best way I can describe it and uh

2019
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,800
it's funny I bet a lot of these that

2020
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:32,718
they were COA would not test very high

2021
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:34,679
but as far as potency you know threo

2022
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:36,920
potency I put the pipe down I think it's

2023
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:40,600
definitely comparable to some of these

2024
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:44,800
high Tac test test things so that's the

2025
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:47,520
other one um the GT4 cut came from an i

2026
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:51,159
mag thread it came directly from Josie

2027
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:54,480
May he rest in peace um I'm not sure we

2028
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:56,879
we're on the fence introducing so if it

2029
01:28:54,479 --> 01:29:00,158
Steve you see this and uh I spoke out of

2030
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,800
line my apologies because we're still

2031
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:03,599
figuring out exactly what we're running

2032
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:07,800
but I know most of that list is going to

2033
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:10,199
be available soon uh the sugar P came

2034
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:12,800
from my favorite sourer cut in the

2035
01:29:10,198 --> 01:29:15,118
industry I know it's a Hot Topic uh that

2036
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:19,079
cut came from Mr Bob

2037
01:29:15,118 --> 01:29:21,439
henel and the cookies in that lineage

2038
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:23,079
I'm not a huge cookies fan but it I like

2039
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,638
them in outcrosses and I kind of

2040
01:29:23,079 --> 01:29:26,960
validate them by hitting them with old

2041
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:28,679
school stuff I have a a few exceptions I

2042
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,920
make for that nothing against them at

2043
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:32,960
all it's just personal preference but

2044
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,800
there's there's some goodness there is a

2045
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:38,158
as a Chassy for me I look at as kind of

2046
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:41,600
like a blank canvas so the sugar puss

2047
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:44,960
that's on there Mr Bob hemple sourer cut

2048
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:47,840
times bag seed mail that was found in an

2049
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:50,920
official cookies draw a while back so

2050
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,679
that's pretty much that one and uh

2051
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:55,359
that's a great plant because it's got

2052
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:57,039
the gas hour turp with the Fresh Bakery

2053
01:29:55,359 --> 01:30:00,399
stuff in there and it's a banger it

2054
01:29:57,039 --> 01:30:03,800
yields heavy checks all the boxes like I

2055
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:06,198
said I I was looking at your list of of

2056
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:09,520
of your strains not the grateful Head

2057
01:30:06,198 --> 01:30:12,238
one well I have a question um about like

2058
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:15,679
the Grateful heads so I am ignorant

2059
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:18,678
actually what so is this a gen uh like a

2060
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:21,079
a clone uh like you're you're providing

2061
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:25,039
genetics and are planning on doing it

2062
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:25,960
globally or uh I'm I'm actually bit not

2063
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:28,519
not

2064
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:31,880
informed oh oh I'm sorry man I should

2065
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:35,040
have done the intro um The Grateful head

2066
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:39,679
is a collective of breeders and

2067
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:42,279
geneticists who have access to a lab we

2068
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:46,440
are offering fzero gen clones on a

2069
01:30:42,279 --> 01:30:49,759
global platform um Steve at craft

2070
01:30:46,439 --> 01:30:52,599
medical the CEO along with Kevin JRE as

2071
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:54,639
as a majority shareholder Dutch blooms

2072
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:56,880
in Skunk VA

2073
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:59,679
and then the minority shareholders or

2074
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,679
breeders and geneticists such as such as

2075
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:06,239
myself um I can't remember them all

2076
01:31:02,679 --> 01:31:10,800
massm on IG um fire in the whole

2077
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:12,638
genetics um Allstar clone from uh

2078
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,400
Southern California's in there and I

2079
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:19,079
can't remember there's 16 of them so God

2080
01:31:15,399 --> 01:31:22,920
help me I definitely it will be a global

2081
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:26,079
Library yeah a real library for Global

2082
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:28,880
Repository the main point about them is

2083
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:30,399
Providence pain of custody is asstight

2084
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:33,560
so if you're wanting to get the real

2085
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:35,799
chem 91 or the real lavender they don't

2086
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:38,199
play around obviously so any genetic

2087
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:41,119
material that's introduced we have to go

2088
01:31:38,198 --> 01:31:43,238
through a very very vigorous background

2089
01:31:41,118 --> 01:31:47,519
you know to the 's degree before it's

2090
01:31:43,238 --> 01:31:51,479
even contemplated so it's exciting for

2091
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:53,040
worry getting one or a hybrid of

2092
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:54,479
something that isn't there when you know

2093
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:55,719
that you're you're getting that through

2094
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:58,439
us you know you're getting the real

2095
01:31:55,719 --> 01:32:01,000
chm91 from the man himself or the real

2096
01:31:58,439 --> 01:32:03,319
chamd or the real pot of gold the real

2097
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,118
lavender and that that's exciting to me

2098
01:32:03,319 --> 01:32:09,479
because nothing against anyone I I see

2099
01:32:06,118 --> 01:32:11,439
so many knockoffs I see s1s I see fake

2100
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:13,759
cuts I just don't even comment anymore

2101
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,839
it's not worth it and and is this

2102
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,480
already available to the community or is

2103
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,719
this something that's coming

2104
01:32:17,479 --> 01:32:22,238
available um regarding my genetic

2105
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:25,000
material I will be introducing it to to

2106
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:28,000
the lab and for testing um January 15th

2107
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,840
or before so sometime however long the

2108
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,719
TC protocol takes mine will be

2109
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:34,840
introduced but we already have live

2110
01:32:31,719 --> 01:32:37,760
drops going and uh you could find out

2111
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:39,600
more about that on the Grateful heads or

2112
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,960
Dutch Bloom's page where I think there's

2113
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,920
a sticky thread with everybody mentioned

2114
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,560
on

2115
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:47,840
there

2116
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,840
okay very

2117
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:54,199
cool and uh so do you still have a

2118
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,880
cultivation facility uh of your your own

2119
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:57,599
in Oklahoma or have you like kind of

2120
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,679
dedicated that space to these other

2121
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,639
projects

2122
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:03,840
or uh that's a really good question we

2123
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:05,600
moved and downsized a little bit only

2124
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,440
because I didn't need acreage and our

2125
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,679
business model is only set up for my

2126
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:12,678
wife and I which shout out to my lovely

2127
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:14,880
wife because she my mother room on sleek

2128
01:33:12,679 --> 01:33:17,560
and she is the my queen of logistics

2129
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,560
without her it'd probably be messy so

2130
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:22,719
thank God for her so for sure uh we

2131
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,639
downsized a little bit I have a half an

2132
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:27,198
acre for outdoor which is all I need for

2133
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:30,400
my purposes and I have a 30X 20 40

2134
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:33,439
lighter here as well and then the rest

2135
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:36,599
of of my home in garage is set up um as

2136
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:38,638
a drawing room and testing area where we

2137
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:41,440
keep the mother room and where I test

2138
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:43,239
everything before I I let it out cool

2139
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:46,678
but uh I I think because of the way

2140
01:33:43,238 --> 01:33:48,479
things are headed that commercial flour

2141
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:51,118
that's a race to the bottom I'm focusing

2142
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:54,238
on feed increases and and maintaining my

2143
01:33:51,118 --> 01:33:56,920
mother's stock and testing my new drop

2144
01:33:54,238 --> 01:34:00,079
because uh there needs to be more

2145
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:02,480
transparency I think from in general

2146
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:04,639
with testing so I I like to post the

2147
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:06,399
mails I like to post the testing The

2148
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,039
Good the Bad and the Ugly and get it out

2149
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:11,000
there so uh you get what I what I would

2150
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:13,679
think is a product I can put my name on

2151
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:17,198
pretty much for sure and so so are you

2152
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:20,199
using that 40 lighter to do all the um

2153
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:23,198
you know the the feno hunting and

2154
01:34:20,198 --> 01:34:25,960
whatnot yes and no right right now I'm

2155
01:34:23,198 --> 01:34:29,079
using my home which has an ample enough

2156
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:31,118
setup but um I don't think it's going to

2157
01:34:29,079 --> 01:34:32,920
justify not having a commercial license

2158
01:34:31,118 --> 01:34:34,799
firing that up with the overhead and

2159
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:38,000
everything at least not not for now but

2160
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:40,039
that's always there I do things

2161
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,319
backwards from a lot of breeders because

2162
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:45,600
my thing is who wants a plant that does

2163
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:47,559
Great Indoors commercially produces for

2164
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:50,480
somebody but falls apart when it's

2165
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:53,000
outside so we have no plant count here

2166
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:55,678
so I'm I'm the opposite I do my testing

2167
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,079
outside for first I make my selections

2168
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,480
based on the most vigorous plants that

2169
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:03,118
don't show sep sep Foria powdery Miler

2170
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:05,279
or btis then I bring them inside and

2171
01:35:03,118 --> 01:35:07,759
test them which is probably the opposite

2172
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:12,519
of what a lot of people do I think isn't

2173
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:15,480
Oklahoma Hurricane Alley or Tornado

2174
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:18,440
Alley um it's shifted in the past three

2175
01:35:15,479 --> 01:35:20,919
years if you follow any of and we're not

2176
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:23,879
in the area that's dry Barren and Dusty

2177
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:25,639
that gets that we're actually in a group

2178
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,079
little place that zone

2179
01:35:25,639 --> 01:35:30,159
7B and we are in the foothills of the

2180
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:33,800
Ozarks in southeast Oklahoma near the

2181
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:36,039
Arkansas border it's just such a great

2182
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,679
outdoor growing climate that I I can't

2183
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:40,399
even believe that we can produce the

2184
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:43,118
quality of the outdoor flower because it

2185
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:45,238
never rains here in the fall it's dry so

2186
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:48,559
we get a lot of the outdoor you know

2187
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:50,678
that looks like indoor

2188
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:55,639
wow not even

2189
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:55,639
Greenhouse no Li the

2190
01:35:55,760 --> 01:36:01,960
no aome just full time full sun full

2191
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:05,198
full sun and that that does require

2192
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:06,800
Vigilant IPM but it like I said I it

2193
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:08,799
took a lot of learning curve to get the

2194
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,159
climate down and to know what works and

2195
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:13,800
and what doesn't work and uh I'm really

2196
01:36:11,158 --> 01:36:17,519
happy to say that we might have had

2197
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:20,360
maximum of the outdoor Harvest um less

2198
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,360
than 8%

2199
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:27,199
loss even if it yes even even it uh rain

2200
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:29,879
here you're still going to get btis with

2201
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:32,319
certain super thick cultivars and

2202
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:35,199
especially if you get uh Bud worms I

2203
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:37,439
mean even even Without Rain that'll

2204
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:39,319
that'll cause mold so the very few

2205
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:41,319
little bits were from the budw worms

2206
01:36:39,319 --> 01:36:44,599
that's a whole that's a big battle here

2207
01:36:41,319 --> 01:36:47,880
and that requires uh they get immune to

2208
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:51,760
bailus th gensis here so I alternate

2209
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:53,679
with uh other things like theel that are

2210
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,880
all all safe organic from the same

2211
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:59,600
company and whatnot it takes that and

2212
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,639
uh getting underneath the plants looking

2213
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:04,360
under it's time consuming but it's what

2214
01:37:01,639 --> 01:37:06,359
it takes to make good flower here in the

2215
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:09,679
state and it's funny some of the

2216
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:11,759
cultivars I've had coas done from indoor

2217
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:14,000
of the same screen and outdoor it's

2218
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:16,520
always a higher not that I'm a huge

2219
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:19,439
advocate of judging weed on CHC content

2220
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:22,360
but tpine content in TC always seem p

2221
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:24,238
with sungrown then the COA from the the

2222
01:37:22,359 --> 01:37:26,799
same strain run into

2223
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:28,959
doors it's the full spectrum I mean full

2224
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:31,360
spectrum we always say this term but

2225
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:34,560
it's the absolute light you know what I

2226
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:37,118
mean it's the planet Sun you know it's

2227
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,199
it's not the planet it's a sun all the

2228
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:41,559
other planets are are around it you know

2229
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:44,279
like we are circulating around the sun

2230
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:47,320
right so it's like this is this is it

2231
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:49,118
the base of life you know is every every

2232
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:51,559
every plant you see you know you've been

2233
01:37:49,118 --> 01:37:53,519
growing up in a in a in a Countryside

2234
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:55,800
right you know cuz you talk about the

2235
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:58,599
Farm as you you were a kid right you

2236
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:01,560
know you know plant from beginning this

2237
01:37:58,599 --> 01:38:03,319
is something you observe they are around

2238
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:05,840
you all the all your life in the

2239
01:38:03,319 --> 01:38:07,679
beginning you don't really realize this

2240
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:10,480
you don't really cuz you are interested

2241
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:12,679
in other stuff first and then actually

2242
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:14,359
it comes behind you and then if you

2243
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:16,359
catch the flow you do it because with

2244
01:38:14,359 --> 01:38:18,960
wheat actually what you told the story

2245
01:38:16,359 --> 01:38:21,158
is very similar to mine also like not

2246
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,760
the the other drama you told but because

2247
01:38:21,158 --> 01:38:25,759
I live in another place but uh you know

2248
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:28,000
from the perspective how you look to the

2249
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:32,000
plant uh and now from breeding

2250
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:34,800
perspective would be I uh I think that

2251
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,599
after I read the mandle mandle you know

2252
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,360
from the 19th C mandle you know the

2253
01:38:37,599 --> 01:38:42,159
first and the second and the third rule

2254
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:45,839
of mandle you know uh he actually did it

2255
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:47,879
on tulps and fish and you know he breed

2256
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,679
with other stuff not Canabis right but

2257
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:54,000
he actually uh was like a guy that could

2258
01:38:50,679 --> 01:38:56,399
see the code in the living organism how

2259
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,840
it behaves the F1 generation from

2260
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:02,079
through two very far away parents will

2261
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:04,480
be a very good hybrid yeah and then from

2262
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:08,079
that hybrid if you go to F2 in the

2263
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:11,198
filial line you will have like the whole

2264
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:13,800
picture of colors now choose one color

2265
01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:16,000
that you like right you know and go that

2266
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:18,199
way because then in the F3 you will end

2267
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,520
up with more of the that color you know

2268
01:39:18,198 --> 01:39:23,638
what I mean yeah that is with tomato and

2269
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:27,159
any other vegetables right real quick on

2270
01:39:23,639 --> 01:39:29,679
F2 that is where a lot of the gems are

2271
01:39:27,158 --> 01:39:32,399
to be found and a prime example as

2272
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:34,000
you're going through line breeding is

2273
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:35,799
there are some jewels that can be

2274
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,599
unlocked I look at it kind of like

2275
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:39,119
opening up the Final Phase in the video

2276
01:39:37,599 --> 01:39:43,039
game for

2277
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:45,719
example I have Super Lemon Haze times A5

2278
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:47,760
Thai and I'm running through the F the

2279
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:51,880
f2s to make my increase which I'm going

2280
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:54,360
to have soon and um I found a recessive

2281
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:58,599
trate Broad Leaf that looked like none

2282
01:39:54,359 --> 01:39:58,598
of them and it smelled like lemon

2283
01:39:59,158 --> 01:40:03,839
gasoline my mind was so blown and I I

2284
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,079
thank God I cloned it and I ended up

2285
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:09,880
pollinating it and because it's so far

2286
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:12,198
away from the goal Target of what I want

2287
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:14,679
with my release which is Jagged salus

2288
01:40:12,198 --> 01:40:16,399
seras thae looking plant that I'm not

2289
01:40:14,679 --> 01:40:19,520
releasing it but I'm keeping that clone

2290
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:21,960
for R&amp;D so my point being is a lot of

2291
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:24,719
end users like feed buyers Sky away from

2292
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:26,880
the f2s I think there's always the

2293
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:29,920
potential to unlock a recessive trait

2294
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:32,920
that you might not see to the F6

2295
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:36,359
generation which would bu in turn be a

2296
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:40,440
pure breeding line or an IBL for sure

2297
01:40:36,359 --> 01:40:42,559
yes yeah yeah I I did a little or I did

2298
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:46,158
a little breeding with a a great apape

2299
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:48,400
sensey star mother and a um or a great

2300
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:52,319
APAP sensey star father and a and a

2301
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:56,000
Run's mother and then um when I got that

2302
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:58,479
to the F2 generation I was getting these

2303
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:01,000
uh two major different uh like

2304
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:02,839
structural phenotypes of like one being

2305
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,319
super short and squat like the Grape Ape

2306
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:07,000
and then one being really tall and

2307
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:09,479
stretchy and um the tall and stretchy

2308
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,719
one I found one where it was just uh

2309
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:14,479
like all grape uh and it was it was

2310
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:16,480
really Pleasant to find that because all

2311
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:19,238
the small ones were very grapy but then

2312
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:24,319
all the tall ones had that sort of uh

2313
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:26,319
spicy earthy um earthiness of like uh

2314
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:27,840
kind of some of the older purples and

2315
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:31,479
and a little bit of what I I remember

2316
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:32,440
sensey star being but um yeah it was it

2317
01:41:31,479 --> 01:41:35,158
was really

2318
01:41:32,439 --> 01:41:37,479
cool I hope you cloned or did you clone

2319
01:41:35,158 --> 01:41:39,158
the unusual I did and then I I did and

2320
01:41:37,479 --> 01:41:41,879
then I moved and I lost everything but I

2321
01:41:39,158 --> 01:41:44,279
still have probably like couple thousand

2322
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:45,800
of the F2 seeds so I I can hunt through

2323
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:48,158
those

2324
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:50,320
whenever yeah the everybody has The One

2325
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:51,879
That Got Away story but this year

2326
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:54,639
because there's so many times when I've

2327
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:58,079
grown it out and was like God I can't

2328
01:41:54,639 --> 01:42:00,560
rev it why didn't I clone that and uh

2329
01:41:58,079 --> 01:42:02,559
yeah this year I got two that I think

2330
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:05,639
I'm really really really happy that I

2331
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:08,480
saved and the one was a volunteer that

2332
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:10,880
came out of my compost pile and it R and

2333
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:13,759
veg and I'm like what the hell is that I

2334
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:17,000
didn't even and I had to backtrack to

2335
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,159
what soil I put in a from run to get a

2336
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:22,520
rough assimilation of what the parents

2337
01:42:19,158 --> 01:42:25,238
were I remember I ran lemon lemon tree

2338
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:27,119
and gorilla four and the plant that came

2339
01:42:25,238 --> 01:42:30,079
out of it I grew it outside you can see

2340
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:32,679
it back on my Instagram feed is louder

2341
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:35,599
than the lemon tree and it's so resinous

2342
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:37,359
it's insane it was a very skimpy

2343
01:42:35,599 --> 01:42:39,560
producer but then again I started it

2344
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:42,439
late outside so I'm running that indoors

2345
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:44,480
for R&amp;D too but uh people if you get an

2346
01:42:42,439 --> 01:42:47,559
ankling and you have a plant even if

2347
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:50,079
it's an early veg and you can house it

2348
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:51,560
trust your gut instinct cuz a lot of

2349
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:53,359
yall are watching this have been around

2350
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:55,920
plants long enough that you can learn to

2351
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:57,559
trust your gut instinct even when the

2352
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:00,118
plant at it's Fourth node that it's

2353
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:03,000
going to be special so what I'm saying

2354
01:43:00,118 --> 01:43:05,000
is uh don't have regrets like all of us

2355
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,399
have and quone it if you think you're on

2356
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,158
to something and don't throw the runs

2357
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:10,399
away either because those always end up

2358
01:43:09,158 --> 01:43:14,198
being the

2359
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:15,960
best OG KB has entered a conversation

2360
01:43:14,198 --> 01:43:18,839
yeah right exactly it's like the the

2361
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:20,560
weirdest you know curliest Leaf looking

2362
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,159
[ __ ] and then it's just not

2363
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:26,480
growing like anything else and then it's

2364
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:28,799
turns out to be just like the best smoke

2365
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:30,839
dude I'm the worst at calling everything

2366
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,440
when I see people a lot of times be like

2367
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:35,039
well we had all these mut and I got rid

2368
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:37,399
of them and I like I'm crying on the

2369
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:39,560
inside because some of some of those

2370
01:43:37,399 --> 01:43:41,319
mutants are worth the wait and they'll

2371
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:43,080
grow out of their stunted trait or

2372
01:43:41,319 --> 01:43:45,759
whatever's wrong with them and develop

2373
01:43:43,079 --> 01:43:48,039
into amazing plants man I'm just

2374
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:50,079
thinking like wish I could keep them all

2375
01:43:48,039 --> 01:43:52,760
yeah even like Mac one you know

2376
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:55,039
like is just terrible because it it

2377
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:57,520
takes forever to get a good clone mother

2378
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:59,319
off of it and then it's like being

2379
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,320
overgrown by anything else that's around

2380
01:43:59,319 --> 01:44:04,679
it and I always hates pollen hates

2381
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:07,840
pollen yeah I thought I was able to get

2382
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:12,480
some seeds off of that

2383
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:14,679
uh that military chocolate dad and uh I

2384
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:17,279
have to run those I have them sitting

2385
01:44:14,679 --> 01:44:20,319
somewhere I have the Caps Frozen lemons

2386
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:22,039
which is similar to that like it grows

2387
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:24,439
and you know it's so you talk about the

2388
01:44:22,039 --> 01:44:29,560
back one and this is another capulator

2389
01:44:24,439 --> 01:44:33,279
strain um it grows so slow in veg it

2390
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:35,000
takes a really long time till you know

2391
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:37,719
it becomes a plant with decent enough

2392
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,319
structure that you want to flower it but

2393
01:44:37,719 --> 01:44:42,239
what's cool about it is that then when

2394
01:44:39,319 --> 01:44:45,039
you flower it it doesn't really

2395
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:49,279
stretch and you know like for indoor

2396
01:44:45,039 --> 01:44:52,439
cultivators see baby or multi-tier

2397
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:53,679
Gardens it's nice to be able to have a

2398
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:56,439
plant that does doesn't want to have a

2399
01:44:53,679 --> 01:45:02,039
big stretch and it's it's super unique

2400
01:44:56,439 --> 01:45:05,158
weed it has a like Jacky T profile not

2401
01:45:02,039 --> 01:45:08,560
exactly Jack more like citrus than Jack

2402
01:45:05,158 --> 01:45:11,238
but um to me it's a sativa that grows

2403
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:14,440
very much like an Indica you know so

2404
01:45:11,238 --> 01:45:18,839
like nowadays when people are wanting to

2405
01:45:14,439 --> 01:45:21,158
grow sativas you know you just can't do

2406
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:24,560
it you know a plant that takes 14 or 16

2407
01:45:21,158 --> 01:45:27,559
weeks to flower you know and gets 10 ft

2408
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:30,239
tall um yeah so the Caps Frozen lemons

2409
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,159
it's culator put out some good stuff I I

2410
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:34,959
think the Caps Frozen lemons I prefer to

2411
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:38,118
the Mac 1 I'm not a big fan of the tur

2412
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:41,118
profile of the Mac 1 and the Caps Frozen

2413
01:45:38,118 --> 01:45:43,198
lemons I think is it's really that one

2414
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:45,439
sounds really good I'll have to get you

2415
01:45:43,198 --> 01:45:49,198
yeah I I respect Cap's work I remember

2416
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:51,519
him I remember him on THC farmer posting

2417
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:53,919
back in the day before his his fit blew

2418
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:56,360
off he stuck with it and I think that's

2419
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,960
a testament because a lot of people out

2420
01:45:56,359 --> 01:46:01,198
there in probably any Walk of Life or

2421
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,118
trade if you keep doing what you're

2422
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:04,759
doing and really have passion in it you

2423
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:07,319
you push forward and you accept the

2424
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:09,360
failures eventually something good going

2425
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:11,639
to happen like us sitting here talking

2426
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:14,639
together if I would have gave up I

2427
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:16,520
wouldn't even be here and we you know

2428
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:18,000
never even expected to be mildly

2429
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:21,560
successful I'm not saying we're taking

2430
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,319
over the world but uh it's really built

2431
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:25,400
and I think that comes with taking the

2432
01:46:23,319 --> 01:46:27,519
lumps and just never stopping I think

2433
01:46:25,399 --> 01:46:28,960
that's the best thing and that goes to

2434
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,599
like beginner people that are starting

2435
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:33,800
out beginning hobby Growers tent Growers

2436
01:46:31,599 --> 01:46:36,440
you're going to mess up share the

2437
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:38,400
mistakes and you you just keep doing it

2438
01:46:36,439 --> 01:46:39,678
and if you never stop and you're around

2439
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:40,879
for long enough people are going to get

2440
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:44,960
tired of seeing the and you're going to

2441
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:47,639
be successful I think and also I think

2442
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:49,679
you know all the Breeders uh the small

2443
01:46:47,639 --> 01:46:52,000
scale or or even the big scale for

2444
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:54,639
example I will tell about Shanti again

2445
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:58,039
Shanti Baba is one of those guys that

2446
01:46:54,639 --> 01:47:00,199
still uh communicating with his uh not

2447
01:46:58,039 --> 01:47:02,118
only customers you don't need to be be a

2448
01:47:00,198 --> 01:47:04,799
customer to ask him something you know

2449
01:47:02,118 --> 01:47:07,679
on his Forum but he's communicating with

2450
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:11,840
you on his Forum on the Mr Nice seats

2451
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:14,239
Forum he has a forum and cap cap coule

2452
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:18,279
does the same thing he has some basement

2453
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:21,678
some basement B you know I love this you

2454
01:47:18,279 --> 01:47:24,960
know these guys really are true breeders

2455
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:29,239
through the caregivers you know you can

2456
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:32,480
talk to them you know SK VA has uh this

2457
01:47:29,238 --> 01:47:37,118
uh how is it uh you know Reddit not

2458
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:39,399
Reddit uh it's Discord yeah Discord and

2459
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:41,920
uh Duke Diamond has the Discord and you

2460
01:47:39,399 --> 01:47:44,118
can reach those guys if you want to you

2461
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:47,520
know I can only accessibility

2462
01:47:44,118 --> 01:47:49,399
accessibility yeah that is great and

2463
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:52,480
then you know that these guys actually

2464
01:47:49,399 --> 01:47:54,559
really care for the what they do because

2465
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:57,519
uh they they are accessible they you

2466
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:59,639
know it's not like always no of course

2467
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:03,040
you can't fake the funk you can't fake

2468
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:05,719
the funk man no many others they are you

2469
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:07,760
know maybe DJ Short is was a long time

2470
01:48:05,719 --> 01:48:10,079
ago also accessible not in that way

2471
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:12,760
because but today he's little older I

2472
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:14,519
think and I respect his work so much

2473
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:17,920
also you know from a European

2474
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:20,679
perspective uh because he's so his

2475
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:23,840
genetics are not Dutch you know he took

2476
01:48:20,679 --> 01:48:26,199
his own genetics and Bre them together

2477
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:28,719
and still has this you know uh I don't

2478
01:48:26,198 --> 01:48:30,839
know much about him rather than I've

2479
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:33,800
been waiting from the '90s to know who

2480
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,719
this guy is and then in 2000 something a

2481
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:38,239
YouTube video appeared with a interview

2482
01:48:35,719 --> 01:48:40,118
with him and I was like wow man this a

2483
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:41,839
professor you know like i' been I've

2484
01:48:40,118 --> 01:48:44,000
been around long enough to know that the

2485
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,760
dut banks that got his blueberry never

2486
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
paid him properly Unfortunately they

2487
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:49,719
never paid him properly it is like they

2488
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,719
took his work and they never let him

2489
01:48:49,719 --> 01:48:54,198
even select with them you know and then

2490
01:48:51,719 --> 01:48:56,399
they advertised it in the beginning as

2491
01:48:54,198 --> 01:48:58,719
it we were working with DJ Short and

2492
01:48:56,399 --> 01:49:00,879
after that they put his name out today

2493
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:03,158
you can just read about blue lines you

2494
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:05,199
know uh we will not talk about people

2495
01:49:03,158 --> 01:49:08,158
can Google it who it is and everything

2496
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:09,960
but I'm actually every time I see this

2497
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:12,799
you know that people [ __ ] somebody

2498
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:15,520
like so directly like that you know I

2499
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:17,679
will always cherish the real one you

2500
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:19,599
know now that we're on that topic I'm

2501
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:21,920
not going to get into the who the how

2502
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:23,599
but um people out there if you're a

2503
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,960
budding breeder or anything you have to

2504
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:29,079
be really really careful careful who you

2505
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:30,560
trust things with because uh we're not

2506
01:49:29,079 --> 01:49:34,198
going to delve on it but I think there's

2507
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:36,080
some validity to this um recently a

2508
01:49:34,198 --> 01:49:38,238
friend that had gained trust that asked

2509
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:40,639
me to acquire some some genetics that

2510
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:44,000
were very rare and dear to me which was

2511
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:47,239
pre98 Calli myth Neville Taz and uh

2512
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:50,238
original Hayes the non AG stuff that was

2513
01:49:47,238 --> 01:49:52,879
sourced in Amsterdam by my friend two

2514
01:49:50,238 --> 01:49:55,479
Tree Farm who uh used to own the Great

2515
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:59,239
area shout out the two trees on

2516
01:49:55,479 --> 01:50:03,279
IG and he got them for me and I

2517
01:49:59,238 --> 01:50:05,238
reluctantly told the friend the terms he

2518
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:08,000
had wanted some Haze genetics and I said

2519
01:50:05,238 --> 01:50:09,559
look uh I know you're threat out in and

2520
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,039
I doubled down I want to make sure that

2521
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:14,480
you can do the increase and do the

2522
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:16,439
selections for me and very recently uh

2523
01:50:14,479 --> 01:50:18,839
this happened in fact the day before

2524
01:50:16,439 --> 01:50:22,000
Thanksgiving 6 months later I didn't see

2525
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:24,319
a picture of them no update no selection

2526
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,719
done and the guy just got really nasty

2527
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:30,319
said they're dead F you so people be

2528
01:50:27,719 --> 01:50:33,560
careful get everything in writing

2529
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:36,559
document anything if it's larger scale

2530
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:38,360
get a lawyer to draw up some contents we

2531
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:40,119
don't like necessarily the plant

2532
01:50:38,359 --> 01:50:41,719
patenting thing but it's still someone's

2533
01:50:40,118 --> 01:50:44,519
intellectual property that meant

2534
01:50:41,719 --> 01:50:46,399
something to them and just be really

2535
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:49,040
really wary of people because a lot of

2536
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:51,198
people have this hippie moniker that

2537
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:53,319
they adapt and then they use that as as

2538
01:50:51,198 --> 01:50:54,678
a math to gain Trust and I I think

2539
01:50:53,319 --> 01:50:57,920
that's all I'm going to delve on that

2540
01:50:54,679 --> 01:50:59,880
topic today is just to uh be careful man

2541
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:02,920
it's my first nature to trust and some

2542
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:06,199
people see that as as a weakness and uh

2543
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:07,719
there's a less and learn in in that yeah

2544
01:51:06,198 --> 01:51:09,919
capitalists are going to

2545
01:51:07,719 --> 01:51:11,480
capitalize I I I want to say something

2546
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:14,440
to that because you reminded me of an

2547
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:16,799
old story that isn't just

2548
01:51:14,439 --> 01:51:19,919
cannabis or it's not about cannabis at

2549
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:24,239
all actually um so first of all you have

2550
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:27,078
to be careful right but what happens to

2551
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:30,359
a lot of people is they get burned and

2552
01:51:27,078 --> 01:51:32,399
they don't trust people at all right so

2553
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:34,319
you should be careful but don't give up

2554
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:37,638
on the human race and don't give up on

2555
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:39,960
people right my story and I I I'll tell

2556
01:51:37,639 --> 01:51:41,000
it quickly I used to go eat at this

2557
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:43,960
Chinese

2558
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,880
restaurant like couple times a week and

2559
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:46,920
this is when I lived in the country I

2560
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:49,400
lived in

2561
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:51,960
cazadero and the restaurant was in Santa

2562
01:51:49,399 --> 01:51:55,399
Rosa it was like from near there go

2563
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:59,800
ahead yeah so it's like 40 40 minutes

2564
01:51:55,399 --> 01:52:03,719
away from where I live

2565
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:06,440
and one day um and this is like pre cell

2566
01:52:03,719 --> 01:52:11,118
phones I think you know this is in the

2567
01:52:06,439 --> 01:52:12,000
9s and uh I left home and I left without

2568
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:14,319
my

2569
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,520
wallet but I eat at this restaurant all

2570
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:19,319
the time yeah I know the

2571
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,719
owner and so I show up to the restaurant

2572
01:52:19,319 --> 01:52:23,399
and I tell the guy like hey you know

2573
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:26,679
what I ordered food to go

2574
01:52:23,399 --> 01:52:30,118
but I left my wallet at home I said can

2575
01:52:26,679 --> 01:52:34,279
I pay you tomorrow and he says

2576
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:36,158
no I say why and he says because I've

2577
01:52:34,279 --> 01:52:38,118
been burned too many

2578
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:40,879
times and so I asked him I said what are

2579
01:52:38,118 --> 01:52:42,839
you going to do with this food says I'm

2580
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,480
going to throw it

2581
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:48,440
away and I'm thinking to

2582
01:52:45,479 --> 01:52:53,118
myself man oh no way and I told him I

2583
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:57,559
said I feel so bad for you that you lost

2584
01:52:53,118 --> 01:53:00,319
trust in humanity to the point where you

2585
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:02,800
would rather throw it away than trust

2586
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:06,078
that someone is going

2587
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:07,039
to you know come back tomorrow and pay

2588
01:53:06,078 --> 01:53:11,198
for the

2589
01:53:07,039 --> 01:53:14,800
food you know and what I want to say is

2590
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:19,000
you know I believe you got to be careful

2591
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:20,480
right you know I mean but and it sucks

2592
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,760
that you got burned you told me a little

2593
01:53:20,479 --> 01:53:25,598
bit of the story yesterday I been burned

2594
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,400
I mean I have a situation where I've

2595
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:30,279
been burned by the same person

2596
01:53:27,399 --> 01:53:31,559
twice you know because I wanted to

2597
01:53:30,279 --> 01:53:34,158
believe

2598
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:36,320
that they would do better because I

2599
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:38,359
maybe I believe in people too much but I

2600
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:40,359
think you got to find the balance right

2601
01:53:38,359 --> 01:53:42,279
don't there's a fine line between being

2602
01:53:40,359 --> 01:53:44,198
cautious and being cynical and I'm not

2603
01:53:42,279 --> 01:53:46,359
the type of person to be wired to be

2604
01:53:44,198 --> 01:53:49,198
cynical I'm very outgoing and I I love

2605
01:53:46,359 --> 01:53:51,118
people so I think it's just basically

2606
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:53,118
never gambling what you can't afford to

2607
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:57,118
lose while still being open to having

2608
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:58,639
trusting relationships that's key and uh

2609
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:01,559
and if you make some gambles you ain't

2610
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:04,760
going to get the big reward too you just

2611
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:07,599
got to gamble with a small percentage of

2612
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:10,159
what of you know of what your net worth

2613
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:12,000
whether it's in cannabis or or anything

2614
01:54:10,158 --> 01:54:14,238
else you know it's like friendship

2615
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,960
requires trust and Trust requires

2616
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:19,919
vulnerability so you gota you gota

2617
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:22,439
like there's so much to what he he just

2618
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:24,158
said too yeah because I've gotten to

2619
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:25,919
where I am today which I'm not quite

2620
01:54:24,158 --> 01:54:28,679
sure where that is other than

2621
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:31,639
Oklahoma by not being by not being

2622
01:54:28,679 --> 01:54:33,599
afraid to be rejected like some of the

2623
01:54:31,639 --> 01:54:35,840
higher profile people higher status

2624
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:39,560
people whether it be in music or theater

2625
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:41,639
or movies um you're never going to land

2626
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:43,440
the Hail Mary that you don't throw and

2627
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:44,920
i' I've ended up in some places that I

2628
01:54:43,439 --> 01:54:47,919
didn't think I would and that's from

2629
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:50,480
being able to accept rejection and it's

2630
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:53,480
kind of like a a really weak analogy and

2631
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:56,039
by no means misogynistic if a guy hits

2632
01:54:53,479 --> 01:54:58,439
on 10 beautiful girls one of them is

2633
01:54:56,039 --> 01:55:01,198
going to go out with them you know what

2634
01:54:58,439 --> 01:55:02,519
I mean so you got to gamble sometimes in

2635
01:55:01,198 --> 01:55:05,279
life because you're never going to land

2636
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:07,639
that Hil Mary if you don't throw it Val

2637
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:08,880
what you said I want Nick to repeat what

2638
01:55:07,639 --> 01:55:12,400
he said because I feel like we're

2639
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:16,359
talking over him and it was it was a a

2640
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:17,799
nugget that that should go ahead ni that

2641
01:55:16,359 --> 01:55:19,399
you think I talked over him no I mean it

2642
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:20,840
was off the cuff and and I've been

2643
01:55:19,399 --> 01:55:22,519
smoking so you're not going to get it

2644
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:25,000
out of me again you're going to have to

2645
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:25,000
back to

2646
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:30,479
that all righty I think that's one

2647
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,439
second speaking to smoking I'm gonna

2648
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:34,319
yell to my uh my beautiful wife to bring

2649
01:55:32,439 --> 01:55:36,960
me a bowl because it's not near

2650
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:40,519
me okay

2651
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:42,319
uh i i s well I remember what I I had

2652
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:44,679
said before so it's uh friendship

2653
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:47,359
requires trust and Trust requires

2654
01:55:44,679 --> 01:55:49,440
vulnerability so that's true you have to

2655
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:54,238
open up to be

2656
01:55:49,439 --> 01:55:54,238
vulnerable it's true like so true

2657
01:55:54,599 --> 01:56:00,360
s you know my what I can add to it now

2658
01:55:58,319 --> 01:56:02,238
is like I've been traveling a lot which

2659
01:56:00,359 --> 01:56:04,359
I told in the last two podcast a lot

2660
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:06,479
little bit about it and you then when

2661
01:56:04,359 --> 01:56:08,158
you travel through different countries

2662
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:11,598
different cultures really really far

2663
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:14,319
away from your your uh home you know

2664
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:16,800
where you used to be in your culture

2665
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:18,960
then normally it's also you have to

2666
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:22,360
accept the the the the difference you

2667
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:24,639
know it's really also uh and then you

2668
01:56:22,359 --> 01:56:27,279
develop a sense of somebody that you

2669
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:29,719
look in the eye directly and can sense

2670
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:31,840
if he wants something bad or not I mean

2671
01:56:29,719 --> 01:56:35,118
I will have traveling through all of

2672
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:37,679
Asia almost uh in the night in Jakarta

2673
01:56:35,118 --> 01:56:39,839
for example which is a place like you

2674
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:41,440
it's not it's actually not dangerous if

2675
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:44,119
you know how to behave you know what I

2676
01:56:41,439 --> 01:56:46,678
mean it's like uh of course if you're

2677
01:56:44,118 --> 01:56:48,359
stupid you're going to go in uh

2678
01:56:46,679 --> 01:56:50,359
different places of the world you're

2679
01:56:48,359 --> 01:56:52,559
going to go in the wrong Street for

2680
01:56:50,359 --> 01:56:55,679
example in Amsterdam we've been attacked

2681
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:57,480
one day you know uh by by some guys but

2682
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:59,880
uh my friend who was with me is also

2683
01:56:57,479 --> 01:57:02,559
from the Balon area and he said a swear

2684
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:04,840
word in Serbian to them and they leave

2685
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:07,920
they let us in the moment and they went

2686
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:10,360
away uh and we were asking in Amsterdam

2687
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,840
at that time why you know why was it

2688
01:57:10,359 --> 01:57:15,039
like that because he was swearing you

2689
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:17,480
know in Serbian and they said to to us

2690
01:57:15,039 --> 01:57:19,479
yeah because Serbian Mafia is having the

2691
01:57:17,479 --> 01:57:21,638
place now you know in this time I don't

2692
01:57:19,479 --> 01:57:24,319
know what who is having it now you know

2693
01:57:21,639 --> 01:57:27,679
at that time but at those times also the

2694
01:57:24,319 --> 01:57:29,679
Balon Mafia was there you know I mean

2695
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:33,279
people on the street the the the bad

2696
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:35,078
guys you know uh you can avoid them if

2697
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:38,158
you have the feeli you don't need to ENC

2698
01:57:35,078 --> 01:57:40,039
encounter them you you you you avoid

2699
01:57:38,158 --> 01:57:43,679
them all the time you know even in

2700
01:57:40,039 --> 01:57:45,560
conversation you you a short and you

2701
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:47,560
always when they invite you somewhere

2702
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:49,880
you don't go and you know you you have

2703
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:52,320
to sense it it's a little bit of a of a

2704
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:55,719
third feeling you know in the God I mean

2705
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:57,399
that's how we survive right you know but

2706
01:57:55,719 --> 01:58:00,158
also with the business it's like that

2707
01:57:57,399 --> 01:58:01,839
you know I've been burned too maybe one

2708
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:04,118
day I will talk about it in the podcast

2709
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:06,800
but really in the business you know you

2710
01:58:04,118 --> 01:58:08,679
get burnt and you have to accept it then

2711
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:12,279
you go on you have to learn something

2712
01:58:08,679 --> 01:58:14,359
from it and you go on you know that's it

2713
01:58:12,279 --> 01:58:18,559
you have to go on right you

2714
01:58:14,359 --> 01:58:23,118
know I want to say something um first of

2715
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:25,719
all L that's such a like

2716
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:28,799
what a proper thing to say that

2717
01:58:25,719 --> 01:58:32,078
friendship is you know being being able

2718
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:36,279
to be vulnerable and open with somebody

2719
01:58:32,078 --> 01:58:37,359
and like that's why um Sasha and I have

2720
01:58:36,279 --> 01:58:40,158
become

2721
01:58:37,359 --> 01:58:41,799
friends is because you know over the

2722
01:58:40,158 --> 01:58:44,638
last few weeks we've been talking to

2723
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:47,279
each other and we've been willing to be

2724
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:49,359
vulnerable and tell each other things

2725
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:52,679
like this and that's when we realized

2726
01:58:49,359 --> 01:58:55,000
that we're so much alike that if we

2727
01:58:52,679 --> 01:58:57,279
don't if we're not willing to be

2728
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,479
vulnerable we don't get an opportunity

2729
01:58:57,279 --> 01:59:02,519
to have these moments and and make these

2730
01:58:59,479 --> 01:59:04,959
friendships if not it's

2731
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:07,480
like you're just like one of those

2732
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:09,480
plastic girls that are really fake you

2733
01:59:07,479 --> 01:59:11,158
know you don't you know like fine

2734
01:59:09,479 --> 01:59:12,559
they're pretty but you have no idea who

2735
01:59:11,158 --> 01:59:15,078
they really are they probably don't know

2736
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:19,360
who they are either

2737
01:59:15,078 --> 01:59:21,719
but but yeah I mean you know I'm say

2738
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:23,238
this me and Sasha have become super good

2739
01:59:21,719 --> 01:59:27,000
friends

2740
01:59:23,238 --> 01:59:29,799
because we did this podcast together and

2741
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:32,560

2742
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:33,800

01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:40,079
me soon we're gonna have like 30 uh

2745
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:43,279
co-hosts because everyone that we do a

2746
01:59:40,078 --> 01:59:47,759
show with I fall in love with you know I

2747
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:52,519
mean a really good idea on that time man

2748
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:56,480
so my friend is a Pioneer he started um

2749
01:59:52,520 --> 02:00:00,960
cerebral feeds with Tony from Saga with

2750
01:59:56,479 --> 02:00:04,319
sond from Sirus he the gray area and

2751
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:07,118
Amsterdam and he's so damn that he's

2752
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:09,319
good at self-promotion he was there when

2753
02:00:07,118 --> 02:00:12,719
all these legendary crosses happen with

2754
02:00:09,319 --> 02:00:15,840
Adam done we should get on here because

2755
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:18,560
uh he just parted ways with a grow that

2756
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:22,119
he was really contingent on that for his

2757
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:23,400
income and I sparked an idea yesterday

2758
02:00:22,118 --> 02:00:25,880
said with

2759
02:00:23,399 --> 02:00:28,839
all with you

2760
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:30,520
pioneering you start a seed company and

2761
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:33,199
he's like dude why didn't I even think

2762
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:35,159
of that I'm like dude what do you mean

2763
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:37,839
I'm like get it going and I will help

2764
02:00:35,158 --> 02:00:40,359
you get it out there that's needs to get

2765
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:42,679
some AirPlay man he was there with the

2766
02:00:40,359 --> 02:00:45,359
pioneers and he won't tell you this but

2767
02:00:42,679 --> 02:00:47,078
I think he met he met the stones in

2768
02:00:45,359 --> 02:00:48,639
Amsterdam and was their weed dealer for

2769
02:00:47,078 --> 02:00:52,599
a little bit he did security for the

2770
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:54,599
whole steel wheel tour over there like

2771
02:00:52,599 --> 02:00:56,400
that so if you'd ever be open to get him

2772
02:00:54,599 --> 02:00:59,760
on there that would not only be doing me

2773
02:00:56,399 --> 02:01:03,399
at solid what make it happen two cre

2774
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:04,760
Farm on Instagram I'm saying can make

2775
02:01:03,399 --> 02:01:06,399
you said you said you said he doesn't

2776
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:09,480

2777
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:12,279
brag can you make it happen that he does

2778
02:01:09,479 --> 02:01:15,559

2779
02:01:12,279 --> 02:01:18,078

2794
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:56,519

2796
02:01:56,520 --> 02:02:01,480
with him for a long time too um you know

2797
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:04,800
like well what I what I want to do with

2798
02:02:01,479 --> 02:02:08,039
this podcast is I want to give people a

2799
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:10,039
platform to tell their story and what I

2800
02:02:08,039 --> 02:02:13,519
was going to say is you know a lot of

2801
02:02:10,039 --> 02:02:16,359
people may look at the title and they

2802
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:18,920
see Mark Gallow and they're going to say

2803
02:02:16,359 --> 02:02:21,880
well who's this guy but you have a

2804
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:25,440
compelling story you have a really comp

2805
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:27,599
telling story and and so that's what I

2806
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:29,638
want to do so if he wants to do the show

2807
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:32,000
it sounds like you know he's got a

2808
02:02:29,639 --> 02:02:33,920
compelling story we would be honored to

2809
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,880
have him do it and the other thing that

2810
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:40,118
I want to add love to man it he yeah he

2811
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:42,960
was there when this all happened man he

2812
02:02:40,118 --> 02:02:45,679
so damn understated I think once he got

2813
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:48,359
into it we would let spark a fire and

2814
02:02:45,679 --> 02:02:52,078
his story needs to be heard

2815
02:02:48,359 --> 02:02:54,078
um and his his gen is some of the the

2816
02:02:52,078 --> 02:02:57,279
rarest most thought after colars that

2817
02:02:54,078 --> 02:02:59,198
are out there I mean he's he's got quite

2818
02:02:57,279 --> 02:03:01,920
a lineup I'll let him tell you and we'll

2819
02:02:59,198 --> 02:03:03,319
save it for the the story uh let's say

2820
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:05,639
let's save this for the show the one

2821
02:03:03,319 --> 02:03:08,639
other thing that I want to add and I I

2822
02:03:05,639 --> 02:03:10,440
know I've talked to you about it is

2823
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:14,000
something else that we're trying to do

2824
02:03:10,439 --> 02:03:16,559
here on this channel is make a place for

2825
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:20,760
smaller Growers to tell their stories

2826
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:24,079
hom growers okay and the thing about it

2827
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:27,039
is you know a lot of people they hear

2828
02:03:24,078 --> 02:03:30,238
these stories and it seems like a

2829
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:33,000
fantasy like man you know I could never

2830
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:35,879
do that or when they see uh pictures or

2831
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:39,760
videos of a commercial grow it doesn't

2832
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:42,679
Inspire them to grow and so I want to

2833
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:44,960
make a place where closet gardeners can

2834
02:03:42,679 --> 02:03:47,239
be proud of their garden and they can

2835
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:49,760
tell their story about how they were

2836
02:03:47,238 --> 02:03:51,399
first exposed to cannabis like you did

2837
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:53,199
like when you told us when you were you

2838
02:03:51,399 --> 02:03:55,399
know planted your first plants in your

2839
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:59,158
compost pile I think people want to hear

2840
02:03:55,399 --> 02:04:02,319
those stories and also when you see a

2841
02:03:59,158 --> 02:04:05,279
nice closet Garden or a little tent

2842
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:07,759
Garden I think that inspires more people

2843
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:11,198
to grow their own than when they see the

2844
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:14,679
jungle boys with a massive you know

2845
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:16,439
multi-tier uh grow room right Gabby I I

2846
02:04:14,679 --> 02:04:18,118
gotta say I gotta say something I said

2847
02:04:16,439 --> 02:04:21,118
it to you before but I want this to get

2848
02:04:18,118 --> 02:04:24,198
out there the dankest weed I have ever

2849
02:04:21,118 --> 02:04:27,000
seen in my life was grown in someone's

2850
02:04:24,198 --> 02:04:30,719
basement grown in someone's truck grow

2851
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,719
with a creaky HPS

2852
02:04:31,078 --> 02:04:37,238
light all right or in a t and that's

2853
02:04:35,078 --> 02:04:40,000
where these people under Every Little

2854
02:04:37,238 --> 02:04:42,439
Rock like you had said earlier in Cris

2855
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:44,479
are and to this day the dankest wheed

2856
02:04:42,439 --> 02:04:47,238
I've ever seen did not come from a

2857
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:48,879
commercial row so that's validating what

2858
02:04:47,238 --> 02:04:52,000
you're saying they have a voice it's

2859
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:54,920
just on a smaller scale some people with

2860
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,760
I love you some people scream I love

2861
02:04:54,920 --> 02:05:00,158
you yes well I think I think the thing

2862
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:02,719
is is and

2863
02:05:00,158 --> 02:05:05,198
like I don't know if it's if it's

2864
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:06,639
humility or like you know when I talk to

2865
02:05:05,198 --> 02:05:08,359
these people they say well who wants to

2866
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:10,559
hear my story why would somebody want to

2867
02:05:08,359 --> 02:05:13,439
hear my story when they

2868
02:05:10,559 --> 02:05:16,480
he well exactly and and there's more

2869
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:20,359
people like them than there are people

2870
02:05:16,479 --> 02:05:23,598
that was that are um drawing on a large

2871
02:05:20,359 --> 02:05:25,439
scale you know know and so like I said I

2872
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:26,679
want to encourage hom Growers now so

2873
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:30,118
with hom Growers it's a little bit

2874
02:05:26,679 --> 02:05:34,118
different right um I we can't bring

2875
02:05:30,118 --> 02:05:35,519
every hom grower onto the show okay but

2876
02:05:34,118 --> 02:05:39,158
what we're doing is we're trying to

2877
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:41,360
encourage them to send us submissions

2878
02:05:39,158 --> 02:05:43,759
like make a video at home it doesn't

2879
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:46,078
have to be professional you know I our

2880
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:47,800

everyone but um you know I I like I said

2886
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:05,118
I really want this place to be a place

2887
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:07,678
where anyone can tell their story now

2888
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:09,799
having said that I want to give you guys

2889
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:10,880
a little insight on the interview that

2890
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:14,320
we're doing

2891
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:18,639
tomorrow cuz I'm literally freaking out

2892
02:06:14,319 --> 02:06:23,599
okay this guy um

2893
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:27,199
he G made strains for the

2894
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:29,400
cartels okay like but but the cartels

2895
02:06:27,198 --> 02:06:31,198
were uh I'm trying to remember what the

2896
02:06:29,399 --> 02:06:34,719
guy's name like when you watched the

2897
02:06:31,198 --> 02:06:38,000
Netflix special narcos the guy who Chapo

2898
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:40,760
well it wasn't El Chapo the Mexican one

2899
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,880
okaya right but like the guy that

2900
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:45,400
invented

2901
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:49,199
sensia trying to remember what his name

2902
02:06:45,399 --> 02:06:52,238
is um but yeah the guy that invented

2903
02:06:49,198 --> 02:06:56,039
selia he got the genetics from this

2904
02:06:52,238 --> 02:06:58,399
guy and I've known him for 30 years and

2905
02:06:56,039 --> 02:07:03,279
he told me these stories a long time

2906
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:05,158
ago and then uh he actually saw the

2907
02:07:03,279 --> 02:07:07,920
craft YouTube

2908
02:07:05,158 --> 02:07:10,158
channel and he made a comment and I I

2909
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:13,199
asked if he wanted to tell his story no

2910
02:07:10,158 --> 02:07:15,759
one he's never told his story before

2911
02:07:13,198 --> 02:07:18,158
publicly and I'm ping in man that's

2912
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:20,400
insane I cannot wait to see I I I've

2913
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:23,039
been up all night thinking about like

2914
02:07:20,399 --> 02:07:25,719
how ridiculous this podcast is going to

2915
02:07:23,039 --> 02:07:28,439
be and it's probably going to have to be

2916
02:07:25,719 --> 02:07:30,639
like multiple episodes cuz he has the

2917
02:07:28,439 --> 02:07:33,078
craziest stories

2918
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:36,400
like I would never do it justice and I

2919
02:07:33,078 --> 02:07:39,960
don't want to be a spoiler but I'm glad

2920
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:42,839
you did did your podcast first because

2921
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:46,000
like holy I'm like I don't know how I'm

2922
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:47,520
ever going to live up to this podcast

2923
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,198
that we're going to do tomorrow like I'm

2924
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:52,040
never GNA be get this get this for

2925
02:07:50,198 --> 02:07:54,960
synergy

2926
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:57,599
very close friend of mine lived with

2927
02:07:54,960 --> 02:08:00,118
them too and they might know each other

2928
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:01,760
it would be just insanity and we talk

2929
02:08:00,118 --> 02:08:03,238
about it on the daily he said that's why

2930
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:04,800
he doesn't like Edibles because he

2931
02:08:03,238 --> 02:08:07,078
dreams a lot about some of the things

2932
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:09,719
that happened down there I could

2933
02:08:07,078 --> 02:08:11,479
possibly get him on there and I'm not

2934
02:08:09,719 --> 02:08:13,118
even it's crazy that that's actually

2935
02:08:11,479 --> 02:08:15,799
happening because I speak to this person

2936
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:18,198
on the daily and he's legit he's got

2937
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:19,279
pictures of down there and he he grew

2938
02:08:18,198 --> 02:08:22,799
weed for

2939
02:08:19,279 --> 02:08:24,960
them so

2940
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:27,000
uh I I probably shouldn't but I'm going

2941
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:28,719
to read I want to read some of this that

2942
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:32,319
he sent me I can't wait to hear it dude

2943

already I didn't go into what the the

3041
02:13:15,158 --> 02:13:21,558
the nomenclature was of the John Wi-Fi

3042
02:13:18,359 --> 02:13:25,158
so the John is Wi-Fi 3 cut the I got

3043
02:13:21,559 --> 02:13:28,400
from um OG Rascal cross to the same sour

3044
02:13:25,158 --> 02:13:30,759
bubble mail um the skinny on that is

3045
02:13:28,399 --> 02:13:34,000
that's for Indica overload lovers

3046
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:36,880
massive prehistoric fans like to be to

3047
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:39,000
twice to really put out longer veg time

3048
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:40,800
and you'll be rewarded with uh your

3049
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:44,078
wheelchair weed where you can sit and

3050
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:47,079
watch yento and not get bored with that

3051
02:13:44,078 --> 02:13:47,078
St

3052
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:54,960
recommended yent of the weed but the

3053
02:13:52,319 --> 02:13:57,000
movie for for the that's for the day

3054
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:59,840
Ender people that don't have a love plan

3055
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:02,599

3056
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:04,920
the The Violet B Burger guard is the one

3057
02:14:02,599 --> 02:14:07,559

3058
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:10,118
list that's a great one too and uh

3059
02:14:07,559 --> 02:14:11,719

3060
02:14:10,118 --> 02:14:13,719
might have been my my wife's favorite

3061

flower and she's very particular she's

3062
02:14:13,719 --> 02:14:19,118
from Northern California so he doesn't

3063
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:19,880
get excited about flower much and uh is

3064
02:14:19,118 --> 02:14:23,598

3065
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:25,039

3082
02:15:00,479 --> 02:15:06,000
gangsters

3083
02:15:02,479 --> 02:15:08,598
yeah oh sounds like stories for another

3084
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:11,679
podcast there's so many I haven't even I

3085
02:15:08,599 --> 02:15:14,880
haven't even scratched the surface well

3086
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:17,359
also related to the The Gallows and and

3087
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:21,199
um Tulsa Oklahoma who had the first

3088
02:15:17,359 --> 02:15:23,359
pizza shop in the 1950

3089
02:15:21,198 --> 02:15:24,678
has done two podcasts with us and we're

3090
02:15:23,359 --> 02:15:26,839
probably going to have to do and I mean

3091
02:15:24,679 --> 02:15:28,679
like when we talk about his story we're

3092
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:30,599
probably going to have to do about four

3093
02:15:28,679 --> 02:15:33,279
or five more till we even scratch the

3094
02:15:30,599 --> 02:15:35,559
surface so we're gonna invite you to do

3095
02:15:33,279 --> 02:15:37,599
more as well um it was super nice

3096
02:15:35,559 --> 02:15:40,719
meeting you Sasha and I I really want to

3097
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:43,000
hear your story because um it it's all

3098
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:46,000
valid to what's going on currently in

3099
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:48,920
your area and all over Europe and I

3100
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,520
think uh we're going to see more Synergy

3101
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:53,599
between the states and Europe as

3102
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:55,639
cannabis legalizes more expansion and

3103
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:57,440
hopefully we can all build long-term

3104
02:15:55,639 --> 02:16:00,359
relationships with one another and keep

3105
02:15:57,439 --> 02:16:03,399
keep some synergistic flow moving

3106
02:16:00,359 --> 02:16:06,359
forward I think so the it will

3107
02:16:03,399 --> 02:16:09,198
definitely uh the the true people you

3108
02:16:06,359 --> 02:16:12,238
know like the true people will always

3109
02:16:09,198 --> 02:16:14,399
find a way to communicate and connect on

3110
02:16:12,238 --> 02:16:17,359
the end you know it doesn't matter where

3111
02:16:14,399 --> 02:16:19,359
you're from no you know what I mean like

3112
02:16:17,359 --> 02:16:22,078
people I think globally also watch this

3113
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:25,039
now not only Europe and America and USA

3114
02:16:22,078 --> 02:16:26,920
I mean uh it will spread and this kind

3115
02:16:25,039 --> 02:16:29,000
of uh it's the biggest Community

3116
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:31,000
actually you can have because you

3117
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:34,599
spitting spitting truth all the time

3118
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:37,120
here you know I have I have never let an

3119
02:16:34,599 --> 02:16:40,478
invisible fent get in the way of me

3120
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:43,160
making friends or anyone's ethnicity

3121
02:16:40,478 --> 02:16:46,079
religion or political inclination at the

3122
02:16:43,159 --> 02:16:48,439
end of the day it's Tey and it's cliche

3123
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:50,920
we we are all one and we are closer

3124
02:16:48,439 --> 02:16:53,439
closely related than we think and there

3125
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:55,879
should be more camaraderie especially in

3126
02:16:53,439 --> 02:16:59,519
the Cannabis industry because we're here

3127
02:16:55,879 --> 02:17:02,920
for the love you know Absol ex I'm

3128
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:05,639
certainly not here to get rich ask my

3129
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:08,519
wife it wouldn't suck if it happened by

3130
02:17:05,638 --> 02:17:11,558
Co happen sense well the the the good

3131
02:17:08,519 --> 02:17:14,120
way to look at it money procured through

3132
02:17:11,558 --> 02:17:17,159
cannabis is it's not the motivation the

3133
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:19,559
monetary it's it's a perk it's not the

3134
02:17:17,159 --> 02:17:21,879
primary motivate the perk is comes from

3135
02:17:19,558 --> 02:17:24,199
the passion I think that's a good way to

3136
02:17:21,879 --> 02:17:26,478
look at it yeah I think that's a great

3137
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:28,240
way to leave this too so I'm going to
