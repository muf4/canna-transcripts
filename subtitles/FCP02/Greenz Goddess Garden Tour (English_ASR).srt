and which types of cannabinoids and

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,920
terpenes they should be going after when

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,640
choosing medication

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
depending on their ailment and disease i

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,239
just like to help

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,679
share research and information to help

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,000
people understand

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,159
cannabis medicine and plant medicine in

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,878
general it's my way of advocating for

26
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,000
the cannabis

27
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,159
plant um so one of the things that we do

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,198
as a cultivator caregiver is we make

29
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,319
medicine

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,519
oils for our patients this one in

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,039
particular

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,719
is a thc stream we go after terpenes and

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,600
cannabinoids

34
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,158
we got a couple different one-to-one

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:20,079
strains of oils that have like

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,200
an uh equal amount of cbd and thc

37
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:26,319
but um i just got some seeds so we're

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
looking at getting into growing more cbd

39
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,719
rich

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,200
strains uh cbg rich strains

41
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,280
and looking for ones with a really high

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,240
loud terpene profile

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,000
because uh terpenes cannabinoids they're

44
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,959
actually found in

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,239
all sorts of plants and food and uh one

46
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,759
thing that i love about growing

47
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,039
organically

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,599
is mainly um the microbials that were

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
pulling up out of the soil into the

50
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,798
plant

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,039
and consuming it ourselves it's very

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,640
important to eat healthy

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,040
foods grown organically with microbials

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
and i believe a lot of reasons why most

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,000
people get

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,599
really bad ailments and diseases is

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,959
because their diets are not

58
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,598
high in rich microbial grown food

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,640
or even medicine it's what got me to

60
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,919
change my mind about

61
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,598
growing cannabis organically and when i

62
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,039
first learned how to grow it was with

63
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,399
bottled nutrients

64
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,439
then when i started getting to the

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,680
medicinal sides of things i realized

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,878
that wasn't the way to go i started

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,599
growing organically

68
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,560
my weed was tasting amazing my products

69
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,719
are great

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
so i continued on with that and i feel

71
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,680
like it's really important to grow

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,159
cannabis and food organically because

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,560
it's

74
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,719
all medicine doesn't matter which plant

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,878
you're getting your medicine from

76
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:51,919
so anyways um i wanted to share a video

77
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,560
with you guys i mainly learned so much

78
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,799
this past

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,120
year about growing organically first um

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,480
first person who brought living soil to

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,480
my attention was

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,719
brian years ago at the denver endo expo

83
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,158
he did a talk about living soil and i

84
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,759
was really into it

85
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,199
and a lot of my friends that i was

86
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,959
growing with weren't

87
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:17,759
so at the time i was the only one but

88
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
throughout the years and through fcp and

89
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,000
through

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
meeting all the friends that i did i

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,519
found out there's so many people out

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
there just like me who love growing

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,719
cannabis

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,200
and food organically and i've learned so

95
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,840
many

96
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,119
different ways of doing it some people

97
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,280
are using um

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,158
microbial teas to inoculate some people

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
are doing

100
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,639
top dressing to inoculate there's also

101
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,399
the korean natural farming side of

102
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,679
things that i learned a jadam way of

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,879
doing things

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,959
and i've taken a few courses

105
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,079
over this past year just learning how to

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,158
grow

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
cannabis in general and i've learned so

108
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,639
much um i apply it

109
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,840
all in the garden which might be a

110
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,079
little bit too much but

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,920
i swear one of these days i'm gonna find

112
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,120
that right basic easy formula that just

113
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,919
works out great

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,519
so i wanted to share my outdoors garden

115
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,399
because if it wasn't for

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,080
future cannabis project and everyone

117

130
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:39,120

or peaches you know just plants

132
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,800
plants are medicine we all have a

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,959
receptor system

134
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,478
and each different plant terpene

135
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,719
cannabinoid

136
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,000
can attach to different receptors in our

137
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,680
systems

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,519
and help us heal so let's get into it

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,840
first i'll introduce you to the ladies

140
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,719
uh these first four plants that you see

141
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:06,799
right here here's one

142
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,039
behind her is another over here

143
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,879
that big one over there and this one

144
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:15,759
right here

145
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:18,000
fcp had a guy masonic seeds on

146
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,080
and he was given out free seeds which i

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,600
was so thankful to get thank you

148
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:27,279
they are los angeles pier kush

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,600
cross with panama red cross with wilson

150
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,478
and that's what these four lovely ladies

151
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,479
are right here

152
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:38,240
they also had um mr toad on

153
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:41,199
this really tall plant back here is um

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,079
haze for days it's really skinny because

155
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,879
when i first

156
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,478
moved to the plant back here these ones

157
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,000
have already been growing back here for

158
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,918
a couple of months

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,199
and i figured it would catch up and it

160
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,918
did this

161
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,639
these plants were started in january the

162
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,959
seed

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,280
haze for days that was started in may

164
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,079
i put that seed in the ground in the

165
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,198
beginning of

166
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,680
june and it's just as tall as the rest

167
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,840
it just

168
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,280
needs some more sunlight i bet if it got

169
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,119
plenty of sunlight it would have grown a

170
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,239
lot bigger than it is right now

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,680
but just to give you an idea let's come

172
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,800
inside

173
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,240
i'm about five three five feet tall

174
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
three inches

175
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,478
and these plants are clearly taller than

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,639
me

177
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:32,159
see this i mean

178
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,720
i can't even touch the top

179
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,680
that's how tall these plants are this is

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,560
my third year growing outdoors

181
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,079
so plants in here are doing absolutely

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,399
amazing

183
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,639
and i've learned so much more this past

184
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,679
year about growing organically

185
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,400
than i have before so of course this

186
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,360
season is going to be my best one

187
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,598
let's see back here you guys remember

188
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,199
having um

189
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:03,360
a [ __ ] sorry i just saw a um

190
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,800
a grasshopper jumping on my plant and i

191
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,680
had to take it off

192
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,720
anyways these two back here you guys

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,639
know miles

194
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
he's the guy that creates we should

195
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,400
taste good gear

196
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,160
t-shirts he also does fermented plant

197
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,000
extracts i've been using his

198
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
pumpkin ferment if you've seen any of my

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,439
videos on instagram

200
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:27,759
he also uh does seeds too this one

201
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:29,360
is wolf glue cbd wolf

202
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,520
i think it's crossed with gorilla glue

203
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,919
but i'm not going to say that for a fact

204
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,799
this is going to be my season's one to

205
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,839
one strain

206
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,759
equal amounts of cbd to thc

207
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,119
one thing i had learned last season was

208
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,520
about chopping

209
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,319
my cbd plants down a little bit early

210
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,560
because i do want to keep that volume

211
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
equal so that way there's not too much

212
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,639
thc

213
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,280
dominance i do have to harvest this

214
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,160
a little bit early than i would like to

215
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,839
um

216
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,439
but not too much i just learned that

217
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,198
from doing it last year so this year i

218
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,800
want to make sure i get it right

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,840
um so that's this one

220
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:13,280
wolf glue this one also back here is a

221
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:14,799
wolf glue they're pretty freaking huge i

222
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,478
put them up in nuts

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,560
and it's not gonna if i'm gonna have to

224
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:22,478
net them up some more

225
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,160
like i said way way way tall

226
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,519
right here i have my favorite

227
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,919
bubblicious

228
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,399
this one's a great one for oils i got

229
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:34,319
these from nirvana seeds

230
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,079
i believe they're out in holland um

231
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,000
this has always been my one when i mean

232
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,440
i've gone with these guys and i kept

233
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
getting their seeds for so many years

234
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,560
and i've never

235
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
had issues other than you know just

236
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,359
making sure to harvest it early so you

237
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,320
can

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,720
um have a good product that has very

239
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,640
equal amounts of cbd and thc

240
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,879
if you wait too long to harvest then the

241
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,000
thc amount might go up a little bit more

242
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,439
but not by much

243
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
but like i said i'm trying to go for

244
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,360
that one to one this

245
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
is the same one it got shaded out okay

246
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,320
so here's the thing

247
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,120
when i first started this um

248
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
little grow bed i walk in it so down

249
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,399
here on

250
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,519
that's the soil and i as you could tell

251
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,080
i got steps

252
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,080
i walk in the bed there was plenty of

253
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,240
room when i first started it with just

254
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,680
six plants and i thought

255
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
well there's so much space maybe i could

256
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,039
put some more plants back here so i put

257
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,679
in the two bubblicious

258
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,159
and then i put in the one haze for days

259
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,759
and

260
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,679
there's definitely not enough room for

261
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,600
these plants i mean this bubblicious

262
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,199
hardly sees any sun

263
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,320
this haze for days hardly sees any sun

264
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,560
um so what happens with the rain

265
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:48,879
when it comes down is it goes into

266
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:51,919
the gutter back here and drops down into

267
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,919
a trash can and i collect all the rain

268
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,559
water and a lot of times i'll water with

269
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,838
that rain water that's been collected

270
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,479
um i also like um i like the jadom

271
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,120
liquid fertilizers i did make a cannabis

272
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,480
jadam liquid fertilizer

273
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,839
back in march we had some

274
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,800
pretty heavy snow and

275
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,240
i put a bunch of old cannabis plants

276
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,679
that i had to

277
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,680
get rid of they turned out to be males

278
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,799
chop them all up put them in a big

279
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,958
bucket

280
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,039
actually a big root barrel filled it

281
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,399
with some of the snow water and just let

282
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,599
it sit in there

283
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,360
for six months and sometimes i'll put

284
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
i'll put a little bit of that juice into

285
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,000
my big reservoir

286
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,719
um also right now since they are still

287
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,278
in the veg

288
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,759
phase when i'm down here watering on the

289
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,879
ground i'll also spray the leaves

290
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,559
to get the food on the leaves as well

291
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,078
and try to come out here early early in

292
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,879
the morning before it gets too hot

293
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:50,479
because

294
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,159
in here it does get really really really

295
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,360
hot and that's probably why these plants

296
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,360
are so huge right now

297
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,759
i also have a whole lineup of things

298
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,839
that i like to um foliar with

299
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,120
one of them is k f maintenance spray

300
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,720
that's one of my favorite things to

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,159
foliar with

302
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,600

304
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,800

368
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,199
on the video and a whole bunch of stuff

369
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,799
got cut out

370
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,719
including the most important part of the

371
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,639
whole video what's in my soil

372
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,440
here's a little view of what we got

373
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:07,039
going on down here

374
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,040
a lot of chopping drop i got some um

375
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,439
redwood bark mulch which worked out

376
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:14,078
really nicely to keep the weeds away

377
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,079
um let's see uh this is my second year

378
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,519
going in this bed i basically do like

379
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,799
accouts mix

380
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,759
coots mixes one-third peat one-third

381
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,078
aeration like pumice or rice hulls

382
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,679
and one-third compost and half of that

383
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,559
could be worm castings and the other

384
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,679
half could be like

385
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:34,078
regular compost that and

386
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,399
that's your basic coots mix and then you

387
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:40,078
have some amendments added into it

388
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,120
like um gypsum glacial rock dust and

389
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:46,239
azomite i use

390
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:49,360
both basalt crab meal oyster shell

391
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,039
mean meal kelp meal yep

392
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,159
that's in there i don't know google

393
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:57,519
coots mix that's what i have in my soil

394
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,600
so i made that a long time ago i didn't

395
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,078
use this bed last year and in fact last

396
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,240
year

397
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,159
there were so many fires ashes all over

398
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,120
and i bet a lot of those ashes fell into

399
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,240
this bed

400
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,440
from a lot of the fires that happened

401
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,000
last summer and this year what i did was

402
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,880
i

403
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,440
grabbed some more a little bit more peat

404
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,519
and a lot of compost and i tilled that

405
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,680
into what i already had in the ground

406
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,919
and i let that sit for about a month

407
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,078
then i came in and i made another big

408
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:30,000
ass batch of coots mix

409
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:33,198
about i did like 100 gallons

410
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,639
and i um put that in here

411
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:39,919
um along with the plants i like to

412
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,159
top dress at least once a month i use uh

413
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,599
this little mix it's a recipe from gold

414
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,919
dust farms

415
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,800
it's got like your basic top dressing

416
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,719
amendments

417
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,000
uh products from like down to earth

418
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,800
stuff like that

419
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,399
you know like oyster shell kelp alfalfa

420
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,159
um gypsum things like that i couldn't

421
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,480
name it all off the top of my head

422
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,360
but i put it all in a mix and that's

423
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,079
what i put

424
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,720
um you know probably about like a cup of

425
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,758

plant do that once a month i do bokashi

427

428
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,359
really well

429
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,479
um other than that chop and drop i mean

430

leaves you've got a defender pull down

432
