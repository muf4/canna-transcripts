1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,120
what's going on

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,400
everybody I am finally back from

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,160
Southern Humbolt from receiving my

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,240
Gan

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,960
certification and now I'm just here with

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,079
the the catfish tester

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:21,839
group weighing in on my catfish thus far

8
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:23,639
we're at like 8 n weeks of veg and I've

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,518
been keeping things pretty small they

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,240
started out in like little Solo cups I

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,879
moved them up to half gallons and now

12
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,919
they're finally in the two gallons where

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,679
they'll finish

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,800
um it's been like maybe 5 days since I

15
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,359
transplanted into the two gallons and

16
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,878
this is the growth that I've gotten from

17
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:47,238
the catfish thus far that one in the far

18
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,558
back is one of the last cfish and then

19
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:49,479
you know it's right here this one's a

20
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,000
different

21
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:55,759
variety but as you can see the catfish

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,039
is rather uniform outside of some height

23
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,719
differences I got some shorter

24
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,320
phenotypes here in the front it looks

25
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,320
like and then the taller ones in the

26
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,158
back and we've just been really running

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,879
with them they manag to stay healthy um

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,400
you know this tent is a little bit

29
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,158
overcrowded so I am having to do some

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,280
folur just to make sure I'm I'm on top

31
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,759
of everything things are like sprayed

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,280
There's an actual IPM regiment going on

33
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,438
um just with NE oil and the FP the

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,478
fermented plant extracts that I

35
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,319
use but for the most part everything's

36
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,599
looking healthy like I said I'm I'm just

37
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:38,000
getting back so this is my first update

38
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:41,399
myself and the rest of the tent I have

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,039
again some Kim dog Special Reserve from

40
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:48,159
Peter some kimd rainbow belts um that

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,359
I've been running you know pretty much

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,520
you know I've been running the rainbow

43
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,399
belts cross dag on there every time I've

44
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,000
pop seeds so these are right here and

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,680
then as we move and shift over here

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,680
we've got the Hollywood uh the hollyw TK

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,799
M10 in the back that's also from dgg

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,600
dolo shout out to Peter um here up here

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,479
we got the Moses and you know this

50
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,719
little one was rootbound when I

51
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,920
transplanted and I just decided to try

52
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:17,239
to transplant it up to see if it would

53
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,958
go it's struggling clearly but that's

54
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,239
okay we are probably going to get that

55
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,479
one out of there um this is this whole

56
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,959
Moses uh Platinum Kush line has been

57
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,399
[ __ ] with me um they went rootbound

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,159
pretty early I've been really trying to

59
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,039
figure them out but that's the fun of

60
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,159
running a whole bunch of varieties and

61
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,239
cirs even though most of them are

62
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,719
somewhat related in some regards um

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,519
these have been giving me the hardest

64
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,199
time though as you can

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,519
see uh we got the comfort food over here

66
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,238
that's cat

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,480
too and again we got some Mass medical

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,000
OG cush by prayer

69
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,679
glue but now the star of the show are

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
definitely probably the TK the hollyw TK

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,439
M10 and then we got we got the

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,878
catfish and I just I'm really proud of

73
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,959
these happy and excited to see the flow

74
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:11,840
got a couple of different fenos as of

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
right

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,560
now but you know we'll see how they

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,360
express once we flip on the flower I

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,199
