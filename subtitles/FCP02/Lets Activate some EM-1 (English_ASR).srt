[Music]

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:17,000
all right today we are going to activate

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:18,799
some EM1 we have our old activated EM1

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,960
container all right so we're going to

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,519
take our

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,160
molasses of course you want to get uh

7
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,239
good molasses you don't want something

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,118
that that you wouldn't want to consume

9
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,640
yourself you don't want to put that into

10
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:36,479
the plant so we're going to use

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,520
5% nice thick good stuff this is a food

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,279
for the uh effective

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,680
microorganisms to consume while they're

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,719
multiplying that's uh quote unquote

15
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:52,359
activation we're taking what's in here

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,760
and making a lot more so

17
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:59,719
uh it looks about 5% you can be a lot

18
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,320
more um scientific and actually measure

19
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:06,320
it if you'd

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,920
like all right and for the

21
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,639
water we have this beautiful water tank

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,159
right behind us but before we get that

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,280
in there we're going to take the EM1 go

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,280
ahead and mix it in there with

25
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:31,359
that about five 5% so about 10% of the

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,360
total volume go ahead and get the water

27
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:40,280
there's some uh goldfish down in here as

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,880
well I think we just scared them off but

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,879
we'll get the

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,360
water diversity is

31
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,280
amazing so we'll have all the amazing

32
00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:00,000
microbes that the the Goldfish are

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,879
producing in there to help activate the

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,519
is so uh once again you can go to

35
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:08,199
panic.com and they have a wide

36
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,840
assortment of of wonderful things for

37
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,199
the garden so go check them out and uh

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,519
this is going to be good after about 7

39
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,439
days you want to keep it in kind of a

40
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,519
warm dark place um and it'll speed up

41
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,878
the the activation rate if it's really

42
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,879
warm it might go a little bit before

43
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,719
then uh but yeah we'll check back in in

44
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:31,840
about seven days and we'll show you the

45
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,840
activated D1 cheers have a good day

46
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:42,839
so now it's been about a week week and a

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,080
half uh we have activated EM1 ready for

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,080
our

49
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,759
disposal over here and now I just throw

50
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:56,598
it on basically

51
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,598
everything that I'm trying to inoculate

52
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:10,009
[Music]

53
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:27,579
take

54
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:27,579
[Music]

55
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,239
let's do something there
