begin i don't know man i

56
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,839
grew up in new england

57
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,399
i grew up listening to really great

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,800
music massachusetts yeah yeah i grew up

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,520
outside of boston about 20 minutes west

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,719
so suburban boy through and through

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
um

62
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,000
but i always grew up i i grew up

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,560
spending my summers uh with my parents

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,039
up in maine and so that's kind of where

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,280
i first got connected to that that beach

66
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,719
lifestyle and just kind of you know

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,560
kicked back on the beach and kind of

68
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,400
went oh my goodness

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,878
how could i do this all day every day

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
yeah and so uh

71
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,799
you know that's kind of synonymous with

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,878
the music absolutely and the surfing and

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
you know this kind of like easy breezy

74
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,120
feel good stuff you know yeah i never

75
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,799
grew up listening to to anything too

76
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,439
hardcore i definitely went through my

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,280
kind of emo phase for a little bit but

78
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,840
it was always something feel good yeah

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,519
so i think being from new england like

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
definitely helped to kind of set me on

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,280
this path of making the music that i'm

82
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,238
making now but yeah well it's very cool

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
i'm glad you're doing it yeah um

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,080
so when did you start playing singing

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,199
and writing tunes

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,640
it's always been a weird little bit of a

87
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,318
rollercoaster of a journey because i

88
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,759
never was classically trained on

89
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,000
anything i never actually really

90
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,919
properly took lessons still to this day

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
for anything tried and failed a few

92
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,000
times but uh

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
i don't know i always grew up just

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,878
making mouth noises just

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,120
being annoying and

96
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,518
bob-a-boo-ying around the house and just

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
singing and yeah finally my mom was you

98
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,920
know she pulled me aside and she was

99
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,559
just like yo

100
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,518
i love you but you're very annoying

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,959
you need to transfer this into some sort

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,840
of something

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,598
so she signed me up for chorus if i like

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,479
you know just like my middle school

105
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,919
chorus

106
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,039
which i hated

107
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,438
so much

108
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,400
because it was just it was too bland and

109
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,400
all is

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
you're learning all the the keys and the

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
tenors and the sopranos again it was too

112
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,958
rigid for me but um that was about the

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,000
first kind of step seriously into music

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,000
was i think sixth grade

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,840
yeah sweet so

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,000
sixth grade and you were taking coral

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,239
yeah and again you know it's just too

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,798
rigid for me and and but but it it

119
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
definitely got my ears going and my you

120
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,078
know my voice going and that's kind of

121
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,000
where i grew my singing voice

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,240
um and i had played a little bit of

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,399
piano in the past but again never really

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
took anything too seriously it wasn't

125
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,439
until

126
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
freshman year of high school

127
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,918
my best friends put together a

128
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,600
four-piece rock band literally in in my

129
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,599
friend's garage

130
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,639
we listened to the red hot chili peppers

131
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,800
religiously dude we wanted to be we

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,360
wanted to be them so badly all you had

133
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,759
to do was get four socks yeah right yeah

134
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
four socks strip down and you're good to

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,680
go

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,478
but it was crazy yeah i mean so we just

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,560
for a bunch of ragtag freshman

138
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,240
sophomores in in high school we took it

139
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,000
damn seriously yeah you know we would

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,800
practice for like five hours a day after

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,160
school every single day and who's garage

142
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,160
uh david von marring shout out to david

143
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
and shout out to david's mom and more

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,039
importantly because she would just let

145
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,720
us rock yeah

146
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,120
my mom had to put up with that too oh

147
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,639
yeah you know how it goes it's just

148
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,280
yeah it's relentless thankfully we

149
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,600
didn't suck that much so like at least

150
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,239
it was palatable to hear but like oh my

151
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,560
gosh that's cool but uh that was what

152
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,079
started the whole thing and and and that

153
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
band

154
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,918
that rock band in high school you know

155
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,600
it was the first time i had ever taken

156
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,519
music seriously

157
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,520
writing a bunch of music and writing

158
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,198
lyrics and and trying yeah that's good

159
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,918
and i had a lot of fun doing it and and

160
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
that that band was actually the start

161
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,240
of

162
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,120
well because it was a four piece band

163
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,519
and then

164
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,199
two of us kind of split off you know

165
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:56,719
once once to make air yeah yeah so david

166
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,960
von marring was the drummer of our band

167
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
and he was always he always had ideas he

168
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,799
was always spinning he was like you know

169
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,478
hey play this on the guitar hey write

170
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
the music like this or like hey let's

171
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,439
try this and try all these ideas and i

172
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
was like

173
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,560
dude we just thought you were the

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
drummer but here he is like with all

175
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,000
these genius ideas and he's kind of

176
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,478
starting to come out of his skin a

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,839
little bit yeah and uh

178
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,680
you know the band didn't end up seeing

179
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,000
eye to eye especially because kind of

180
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,759
college was coming up around the corner

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,839
we were ready to just go all in on this

182
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,680
band yeah and you know

183
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,038
that's that's not everybody's path in

184
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,879
life so

185
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,879
david and i split off and we did our own

186
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,639
thing and that's where air came from so

187
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,879
wow that's cool that's cool it was a

188
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,800
natural kind of progression

189
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,639
yeah who are your musical influences

190
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,038
besides the chili peppers

191
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
yeah well i hate these guys with all my

192
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:45,439
heart this is the worst band i've ever

193
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,399
heard

194
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,639
um

195
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,519
i was figuring you uh had some old

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,120
school influences oh dude i um

197
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,799
i mean admittedly you know i'll be

198
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
honest you know i grew up with music in

199
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,919
the house so yeah you know i was always

200
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,519
familiar with the beatles always

201
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,879
familiar with the stones and the beach

202
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,198
boys and

203
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,918
everybody but

204
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,160
it wasn't it it's not until you as an

205
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,198
adult or you as a listener you decide

206
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,639
i'm going to go back and i'm going to

207
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,400
listen to that stuff

208
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,478
so it wasn't until maybe five or six

209
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,679
years ago that i actually went from like

210
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,079
50s

211
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,400
all the way up to like you know the 80s

212
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,639
and just like listen to every album of

213
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,079
of all the greats everybody knows the

214
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,360
names right but like do you ever

215
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,959
actually sit down and listen to the

216
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,439
catalog and so finally i did um

217
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,198
but influences i mean it's got to be

218
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,639
got to be the beatles got to be the

219
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,680
beach boys

220
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
i love

221
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,000
this new funky group out of houston

222
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,159

00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,478
intersection of like psychedelia retro

230

of course um

243
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,800
slightly stupid big time

244
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:35,038
i was a dirty heads fan when i was 12.

245

so like you know

246
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,679
these are the guys that that

247
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,918
shaped you know my sound now and and my

248
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,000
style now i'd say i've just spent maybe

249
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,240
the past 10 years honing it you know

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,278
yeah guitar influence

251
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,560
mark spear lead of uh lead lead

252
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,399
guitarist of krong bin he's uh

253
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,759
he just has a conversation

254
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,360
like they don't really have a lead

255
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,799
vocalist right you know now they're kind

256
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,800
of trying to do vocals but they don't

257
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,159
have a lead vocalist his guitar is the

258
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,439
lead vocal right

259
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,759
you just hear it you hear this

260
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,680
conversation you hear these melodies and

261
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,600
yeah [ __ ] i'm nowhere near being able to

262
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,319
play like that but

263
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,440
that that showed me a whole new style

264
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,000
and also opened me up into like

265
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,600
vietnamese rock uh

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,120
60s arabian funk like all this crazy

267
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,040
music that i never thought i'd listen to

268
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,399
i'll have to play you my old band i hope

269
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,399
dude

270
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,679
thai background singers

271
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,600
we're not here you're talking about them

272
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,838
that was sorry but

273
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,680
him and then of course him from a lead

274
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,839
standpoint and then i would say you know

275
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,919
the beatles just continually blow my

276
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
mind with their chord progressions yeah

277
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,199
their chord changes oh my god how do you

278
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
get from here to there and how do you do

279
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,120
it so smoothly so i'll sit down i'll try

280
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,360
and study those you know they've

281
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,278
been a huge influence so yeah beetles

282
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,120
are amazing it's a little hard to fit in

283
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,958
all those

284
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,720
c major seven to a dominant fifth with a

285
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,879
minor nine thought that it's a little

286
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,720
hard to fit that into like uh a reggae

287
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,480
groove you know yeah sometimes a sweet

288
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
chord right yeah a little too over

289
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,720
complicated but you know the beatles

290
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,039
chord changes were

291
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,120
non-top incomparable and same with with

292
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,838
beach boys yeah i mean brian wilson he

293
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,919
used to study you know bach and he would

294
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
study mozart yeah and that's how he

295
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,879
would make his chord progressions and

296
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,079
she's like

297
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:27,360
damn dude that's far out that's cool so

298
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,879
is surfer girl kind of a concept

299
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,600
yeah and who are they i mean you got a

300
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:34,320
band right yeah yeah um

301
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,519
you know so first and foremost you know

302
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,120
the name

303
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,320
certainly comes from my love for the

304
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,278
beach boys yeah uh surfer girl is

305
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,800
one of my favorite songs by them i mean

306
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,799
yeah you could go for days on all the

307
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,559
songs loved by them but that one you

308
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,199
know that one stuck out to me when i was

309
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,518
young and that one has continually like

310
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,040
stood up to the test of time for me

311
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,879
um

312
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,958
moved to l.a

313
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,879

314
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,119

318
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,560
beach boys between the song and then

319
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,480
between the fact that i think

320
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,239
well i see it in two ways i see

321
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,920

all of those folks and and those women

336
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,760
but then also at the same time

337
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,759
you know i feel like 2022 is a fun time

338
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,480
and it's an interesting time in a place

339
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,679
where i can be a male front man of a

340
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,680
band and

341
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,799
put together a band called surfer girl

342
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,399
and

343
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,240
may confuse a few people they may be

344
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,000
expecting some hot blonde to come out on

345
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,360
stage and they get me instead but you

346
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,958
know like

347
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
i think it's a fun time you know people

348
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,199
i think are shedding labels a little bit

349
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,120
and having a good time and just it's

350
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,959
about the vibe so yeah

351
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,440
yeah yeah it's very cool thanks um

352
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:25,039
was that first surfer girl ep written

353
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,360
during the pandemic yeah yeah um

354
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,439
yeah it was a crossroads of a time it

355
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,879
was definitely an interesting period for

356
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,200
the world and for everybody but

357
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,159
definitely for me personally

358
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,240
um

359
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,958
air had split up you know five years

360
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,959
prior um the duo that that kind of got

361
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,199
my foot in the door musically

362
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,479
i was struggling to do solo music for a

363
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,000
long time um

364
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
because each song sounded different from

365
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,200
the last yeah which i've kind of prided

366
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,958
myself man nothing long right right no

367
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,800
and i was priding myself in that and to

368
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,958
me i was kind of going through different

369
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,799
styles to see what stuck with the

370
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,599
audience but what what felt authentic to

371
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,799
me

372
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
um

373
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,000
so you know i think it was hard to grasp

374
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,278
onto for a lot of fans but but long

375
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,559
story short you know i kind of got to a

376
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,078
point where

377
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,039
financially i was looking at myself and

378
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:15,519
i said oh [ __ ] maybe it's time to

379
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,559
do what mom always says and get a real

380
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,320
job and throw in the towel and not to

381
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,319
say i get pressure from my mother she's

382
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,639
very supportive but you know yeah yeah

383
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,639
yeah well yeah moms are like that yeah

384
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,720

385
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,200

457
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,560
it's it's really

458
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,800
adam and thomas man both young dudes and

so

461
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,838
speaking of that ep let's talk about

462
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,320
hero a bit

463
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,480
let's um come out swinging and you know

464
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,879
this this this is a song that then

465
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,199
endeared my son to you because he has

466
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,838
some political ideas about who wasn't

467
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:25,039
cool a few years ago yeah yes

468
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,040
um are we still looking for a hero

469
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,439
i think so yeah uh definitely i mean in

470
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,320
the context of you know

471
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,680
hero is not a sugar-coated song by any

472
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,480
means

473
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,278
i

474
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,519
wrote that the president don't know [ __ ]

475
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,078
right and i said that loud and i said it

476
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,078
proud and i still stand by it i stand by

477
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,239
that too i think

478
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,679
in time the funny thing was and and so

479
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,039
like on youtube i'll get so many

480
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,679
comments and it was written in what year

481
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,480
it was 2017 right right yeah so it was

482
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,719
definitely a a for me it was a [ __ ]

483
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,480
trump anthem yeah i was pretty pissed

484
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,278
off and fed up and to me i

485
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,519
i

486
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,359
wholeheartedly believe that both sides

487
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,240
of the coin are

488
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,240
pretty bad yeah real bad you know yeah

489
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,759
we're still in a bunch of hot water

490
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,279
there oh tim who knows if we're ever

491
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,919
going to get out of to me it's it's

492
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,720
personal freedoms it's supporting people

493
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,480
and it's and it's also equitable support

494
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,679
for people who

495
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,838
if for

496
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,400
years generations our country was built

497
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,918
on supporting some and not others can we

498
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,559
just even the playing field that's

499
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,919
really what i want to do yeah and and

500
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,119
that's kind of the message of the song

501
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,120
was just like yo this

502
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,480
i think it was a pointed [ __ ] trump

503
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:45,599
anthem when it came out but it's cool

504
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,919
because it has lived on and and kind of

505
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,798
grew a new meaning to me which is

506
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,160
you know

507
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,079
everybody was

508
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,038
joe biden was not my top choice he was

509
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,798
not in my top 15 of trump that's why

510
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,519
maybe he's not my hero but he's not the

511
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,960
hero no no not at all he is not and so

512
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,319
it's funny because you make a strong

513
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,919
statement like kind of like the

514
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,519
president don't know [ __ ] [ __ ] trump

515
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,000
kind of thing and now everybody comes

516
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,000
how's your buddy biden doing yo this was

517
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,558
not my guy to begin with right but what

518
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,640
i will say is i'd rather have someone

519
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,399
at least seems like fighting for the

520
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
right direction of humanity and the

521
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,919
country and climate change

522
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,160
uh then not but with all that said

523
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,400
um the the message of the songs kind of

524
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,960
still still stands true yeah and when i

525
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,640
perform it live you know i kind of i

526
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,079
kind of tweak the lyrics a little bit

527
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,480
from uh

528
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,480
our president don't know [ __ ] to a

529
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,640
president can't do [ __ ] and like a

530
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,880
president won't do [ __ ] or or a

531
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,759
president don't know [ __ ] like it to me

532
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,880
it is more about

533
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,798
you can't rely on one human

534
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,520
yeah to

535
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:55,038
solve all the world's problems

536
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,960
and treat everybody fairly and and

537
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,558
and the system that we have the system

538
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,160
is broken let's open our minds you know

539
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:04,000
the system we do have is not

540
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,000
built in a way that's going to help

541
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,839
everybody and listen to everybody's

542
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,359
needs and so to me this kind of

543
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,558
overarching thing of like a president

544
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,918
can't be the one

545
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,839
to help you

546
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,520
you know it starts from within you got

547
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,519
to help yourself you got to help your

548
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,839
community you got to start small like

549
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,798
you were saying you know vote small you

550
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,558
know try and get someone you like in

551
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,879
build a strong community grow some

552
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:29,440
[ __ ] food grow some weed have a good

553
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,799
time and connect on that level and i

554
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,880
think that's where it's going to start

555
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,960
from so to me the message has more

556
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,120
become

557
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,360
don't just cast a vote and rely on this

558
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,959
person to fix everything it really does

559
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,719
start from within and it does start from

560
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,558
connecting you know on on the ground

561
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,079
level that's cool bro so that's where

562
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,639
it's at still looking for a hero for

563
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,480
sure absolutely yeah

564
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,200
definitely

565
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,079
as i listen to your music i can't help

566
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,279
but

567
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,759
think

568
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,918
what is your creative process because

569
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,079
you know as a songwriter

570
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,919
you look at other people's songs and i

571
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,359
really admire your songwriting process

572
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,559
so what is your

573
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,959
creative process

574
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,798
yeah um

575
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,038
i've been producing music for a long

576
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,359
time but i never felt confident that the

577
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,279
music i was producing was good enough or

578
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,359
you know up to snuff

579
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,359
until that ep and i kind of just like

580
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,038
said effort let's take this leap of

581
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,918
faith you know we got the label behind

582
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:24,960
us

583
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,320
and

584
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,079
that was the first

585
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,119
full body of work that i had kind of

586
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,119
produced

587
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,359
myself um

588
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,439
so the process now is you know just kind

589
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:39,119
of sit down with a blank

590
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:43,200
slate be it on a computer in in logic

591
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:45,759
pro being my my blank slate

592
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,000
yeah or just sit down with a guitar

593
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,839
outside somewhere or sit down with a pad

594
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,519
of paper um

595
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,399
i don't have one specific way in which

596
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,960
it starts but once it's sparked

597
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,840
i chase it down um well

598
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,079
i like

599
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:04,558
each your songs have like a chorus

600
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,319
a bridge yeah and versus you know what i

601
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,480
mean and they're they're it's and each

602
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,480
one of them seems to have a hook yeah

603
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,640
thank you you know what i mean

604
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,640
the formula isn't uh reinventing the

605
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,600
wheel by any means well

606
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
like you were saying i mean

607
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,480
they're

608
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,919
i believe these are pop songs you know i

609
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,240
think they're really catchy they're

610
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,000
pretty traditional song structures you

611
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,440
know i'm not doing anything wild i'm not

612
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,919
reinvented they're genuine they're not

613
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,360
like yeah no i appreciate that because

614
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:36,400
it contrived you can still do an a b a b

615
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,000
kind of song and and and have it be good

616
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,000
oh yeah you know and and have it be

617
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,200
catchy and not too bubblegum or not too

618
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,880
to this or to that so i'm kind of happy

619
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,640
with the process i'm kind of happy i

620
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,919
think you know eventually i would love

621
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,159
to kind of

622
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,159
i'm having a lot more fun with just like

623
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,000
instrumental breaks yeah yeah yeah let

624
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,039
the people breathe i don't need to be

625
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,960
singing from minute one i love those and

626
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,440
surf guitar yeah

627
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,759
interludes exactly so i've been having a

628
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,159
lot more fun and letting the soul speak

629
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,480
a little more and just kind of

630
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,640
going off of feel more so than going off

631
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,480
of like what i think is an impactful

632
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,159
arrangement you know

633
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,759
just have a good time

634
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,360
i know this question probably should

635
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,279
have been asked earlier but how old were

636
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,678
you when you started air

637
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,599
yeah um so like i was saying that you

638
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,880
know it came out of a four-piece band

639
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,079
right was freshman sophomore junior year

640
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,520
of high school

641
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,918
yeah we actually

642
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,119
i think it was right before my 17th

643
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,679
birthday

644
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,399
when we first put music out as air and

645
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,759
you you guys had some success with them

646
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,960
yeah i mean i wouldn't be here now if it

647
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,359
weren't for that hands down yeah um

648
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,440
creatively but also you know being able

649
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,798
to stay in music full-time um

650
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,320
we were young

651
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,319
it was senior year of high school and

652
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,798
this was like the golden age of youtube

653
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,038
and facebook and everything and and the

654
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,400
music was just blowing up yeah and i

655
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,720
remember one day going into the

656
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,120
principal's office and requesting the

657
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,279
principal for a weekend off or the

658
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,519
friday going into a weekend off because

659
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,079

he gave you the day off well yeah yeah

666
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,799

667
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,280

668
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,400
students take a day off to go

669
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,918

670
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,519
debaucherous [ __ ]

sounds

673
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,639
like a mess but he was also the guy who

674
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:47,038
was all about experience and learning

675
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,000
from right going out and doing it that's

676
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,720

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,079
yeah and he was he was he let us go yeah

678
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,919

679
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,918
you know we just

680
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,320

[Music]

729
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,398
i was going to ask you about the

730
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,240
transition between air and surfer girl

731
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,158
but i think we kind of went over that a

732
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,440
little bit so let me ask the next

733
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,919
question

734
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,320
joyride kind of deals with reality and

735
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,399
yet has a little bit of an escapist vibe

736
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,359
can you talk about joy or haida

737
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,918
yeah i mean i'm trying to think you know

738
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,798
that the whole ep was written

739
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,960
at the same time so you know the themes

740
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,278
are somewhat similar throughout but it

741
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,120
definitely

742
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,519
was this you know

743
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,918
i had never felt more alive at the time

744
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,240
because i was getting to be in the water

745
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,200
every day which you know even in

746
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,960
california can be a little rare but

747
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,600
every day in the water for like five

748
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,000
hours a day and just never felt more and

749
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,719
and creatively connected with the music

750
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,240
and

751
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,720
i would come out of the water and have a

752
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,640
new song idea in my head and just

753
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,399
i never felt

754
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,559
more

755
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,558
you know at peace but it was in this

756
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,720
juxtaposition of

757
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,158
i was also at a crossroads with myself

758
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,079
not knowing professionally where i

759
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,320
wanted to go

760
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,599
you know not exactly knowing what it was

761
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:23,678
that was

762
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,759
making me happy at the time and this was

763
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,640
like the whole world had shut down and

764
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:31,919
gone to [ __ ] it was a dark

765
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,880
time but yet i was able to take a lot of

766
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,880
right

767
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,480
moments of peace through it all and so i

768
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,919
almost kind of felt guilty about that

769
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,200
but then at the same time i'm like yo

770
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,120
you should just get whatever piece you

771
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,120
can get and so

772
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,879
joyride always felt to me as like this

773
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,918
song where it was like

774
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,760
you know

775
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,159
you're young you're lost you're kind of

776
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,319
looking around but like you know you're

777
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,559
still the sun's still shining on your

778
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,759
back even if it's like you know yeah

779
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,639
even if it's a dark time and you know

780
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,720
you know

781
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,080
i'm still driving the car you know to

782
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,960
and from the beach i still got the

783
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,278
spliff in my mouth you know you

784
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,200
kind of given a little perspective that

785
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,839
you know while you may be all up in your

786
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
head or or times may be a little tough

787
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,720
you know there are those little wins

788
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,720
throughout that can kind of keep you

789
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,240
pushing and keep you moving yeah it's a

790
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,919
great song when i listen to it it

791
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,399
reminds me of when i was young at the

792
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,880
beach yeah it's we and that feeling you

793
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,158
get of freedom and it's beautiful day

794
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,480
and it's like

795
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,320
yeah forget it but there's like this

796
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,240
almost there's this aggression behind it

797
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,000
too which is like let's [ __ ] hustle

798
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,759
and like it's time to work but at the

799
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,519
same time

800
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,558
you know be grateful for what you got

801
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,558
it's yeah i like doing that a little bit

802
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,639
a little bright with the dark

803
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,319
happy with the sad yeah you'll always

804
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,080
find kind of those bittersweet vibes in

805
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,839
my music for sure yeah and if we're not

806
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,079

808
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,278

809
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,639

810
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:57,679
i'm lazy

811
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,519
so

812
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,399
well i moved to california and had never

813
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,480
surfed a point break ever

814
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,359
i had never well i went to sunset for my

815
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,599
first time which is sun slow yeah it's

816
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,319
well it's it's slow it's beautiful it's

817
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:15,119
just long peeling waves

818
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:18,240
granted it is crowded and it's kind of

819
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:20,239
dirty but you know what i i just i go to

820
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,759
sunset really all the time because if

821

00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,919
yeah

823
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,440
longest ride i've ever ridden and

824

00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,759
psychedelic tan

849
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,359
let's talk about that in a minute yeah

850
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,960

851
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,879

you yeah

853
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,919
that was all shot in maine um

854
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,679
so that that's a crazy culmination

855
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,000
because

856
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,159
for a while there i was trying to trick

857
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,720
myself and tell myself i'm going to

858
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,880
be in the band and put out surfer girl

859
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,640
music but at the same time i'm still

860
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,080
going to be putting out solo carter

861
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,080
reeves music and we're going to do both

862
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,798
at the same time and everyone's going to

863
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:47,119
be so blown away by how cool that is

864
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,639
that is putting out secret side projects

865
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:50,398
and all this [ __ ] yeah yeah that's

866
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,399
exhausting you can't be you can't be two

867
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,879
artists dividing yourself up too much

868
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,719
and so when i was writing writing the ep

869
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,880
the the surfer girl ep that was also

870
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,759
when super bloom i wrote super bloom and

871
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,600
it was also when i wrote um another song

872
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,119
called let it slide and a song called

873
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,240
tell me laurel which are all the kind of

874
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,199
newer carter reef singles and grip um

875
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,120
yeah

876
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,679
that's an older one but but yeah you

877
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,158
know same same style and so

878
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,679
um super bloom's my favorite yeah like i

879
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,159
was telling you i was getting like heavy

880
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,679
into kind of like groove bass music drum

881
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,120
drum you know just one the drum and the

882
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,120
bass lock in

883
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,158
all is well in the world and you know

884
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:30,000
that kind of surf tones and psychedelia

885
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,080
and all this stuff so it's funny because

886
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,319
i put out super bloom tell me laurel and

887
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,158
and let it slide under carter reeves

888
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,759
they didn't get much traction but

889
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,760
listening back to them i go these would

890
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,759
be some pretty rad surfer girl songs

891
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,200
yeah especially super bloom yeah right

892
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,038
if it would fit right in i think it

893
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,640
would fit right in and so you know

894
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,640
sometimes i look back and say hey you

895
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,640
know maybe i should have just held on to

896
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,080
that for what i knew was

897
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,840
was the project with the hope and the

898
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,480
excitement behind it but so you're going

899
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,759
to put carter reeves on hold for him a

900
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,519
little bit yeah yeah yeah i think i was

901
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,440
i was having a bit of an identity crisis

902
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,599
you know i didn't know

903
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,600
i didn't know what i was doing and and

904
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,598
and it and it was it didn't seem to be

905
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,000
working well creating is what you were

906
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,639
doing yeah yeah well that's thank god

907
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,398
you know i always look at that i go yeah

908
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,480
once you create something unless you

909
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,118
destroy it you can't uncreate it that

910
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,079
right there is a win already so

911
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,679
so

912
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,079
family off cali roots rhythm 2021 yeah

913
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,320

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,960
yeah right and yeah

915
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,119
what an amazing opportunity to to

916
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,679
collaborate with freaking collie buds it

917
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,480
was uh how did you get a hold of colin

918
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,599
and how did that happen that was a wild

919
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,039
couple weeks because i got a call from

920
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,200
from adam

921
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,878
saying cauli listen to the project he's

922
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,319

923
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,878

924
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,559
the the 2021 rhythm and like

925
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,960
you know immediately and oh it's

926
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,880
produced by johnny cosmic by the way and

927
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,358
cauli and so immediately i was just like

928
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,720
okay whoa that's a big deal but on top

929
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,799
of that the fact that collie even took

930
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,039
the time to listen and gets down with

931
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,119
the project and likes it i was just like

932
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,719
you know i grew up i grew up listening

933
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,480
to cauli as well you know he didn't have

934
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,719
as strong an impact as you know some of

935
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,079
those other guys but i was a big fan

936
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,759
yeah um i like comment buds he's rad

937
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,480
yeah well and so and colin's very nice

938
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,240
guy he's a [ __ ] sweetheart man he's

939
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,679
great but it it so it was crazy because

940
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,679
it went from

941
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,358
hey you want to hop on this rhythm and i

942
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,679
was yeah sure and i actually had a

943
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,279
really hard time writing to it at first

944
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,319
because i think i wanted to do something

945
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,760
so crazy and then i kind of just let

946
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,240
let the heart take over a little bit and

947
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,680
that's where we ended up i really loved

948
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,439
the song and i sent it to adam and he

949
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,279
goes dude this is super unique nobody

950

952
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,720

just like empty second verses empty

994

998
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,160
saying you know i'm happy to fill it out

999
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,400
you know but i still think we can find

1000
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,399
someone that will put a weird and cool

1001
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,240
spin on it because it's definitely

1002
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,800
got a hip-hop vibe to it definitely in

1003
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,199
the beat and so

1004
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,680
um the label put me in touch with with

1005
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,039

1006
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,879

just hey this is a guy in the scene he

1009
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,400

folk

1011
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,760
connor reggae thing like he was on the

1012

1015
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,320

1068
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,680
some sub bass to it he added a new

1069
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,000
little guitar line on top yeah the bass

1070

1184
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,358
run through the filter of johnny cosmic

1185

touring with them they are tight they

1258
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,760
are down to a t yet they give each other

1259
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,439
enough freedom to have a good time

1260
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,680
