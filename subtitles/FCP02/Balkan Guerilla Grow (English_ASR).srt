hi

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,120
future cannabis project i'm a guerrilla

6
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,439
grower from

7
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:50,558
balkans europe i grow different things

8
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:53,519
vegetable trees and so on but

9
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,280
this video is about my hidden cannabis

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,520
garden

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:03,600
i grew on a nearby hill about

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,200
an hour from my home

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,109
mostly in native soil

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
which is a kind of a red clay so

15
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:15,280
[Music]

16
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:18,319
the only amendments i use are the

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,920
cow manure from the local

18
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:24,879
from the local cows the water i use is

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,879
mostly fabric

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:34,159
water uh a small amount of water is a

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,479
rainwater i collect on the hill

22
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,799
i've been growing mostly bag seed

23
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:46,239
last few years which is a albanian

24
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,240
weed you buy on the streets

25
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,719
this year i'm trying out something

26
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:55,839
different

27
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,840
but first some videos of my last year

28
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:16,500
i had three plans two made it

29
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:16,500

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,159
round about summer solstice is also a

35
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:56,639
time

36
00:02:52,159 --> 00:03:00,079
when wild fruits start to ripen

37
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:04,878
like these blueberries

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:08,080
and wild figs which are my favorite

39
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,079
they're abundant on the hill

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,000
so it's something to munch on while i

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:19,840
like by

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,840
carrying water on my back

43
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,959
last year i harvested the plant around

44
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:46,000
50 15th of september

45
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,319
maybe a bit early a week

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,280
or two because i had a terrible rain

47
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,479
for a few days and heavy winds but

48
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,239
mostly it's in

49
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:03,438
hot and arid environment till october

50
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,759
that's why i decided this year to try

51
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:12,840
auto seeds i bought the cheapest

52
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:16,959
outer seats i can find about 5 euro for

53
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,639
bean so far they're doing great

54
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:24,399
as i said in native soil and

55
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,199
mostly rain these last days they grew up

56
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,638
very nice

57
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,400
and they're loving the sun which i think

58
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,960
is the

59
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:42,478
greatest factor in

60
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:42,478
growing these plants
