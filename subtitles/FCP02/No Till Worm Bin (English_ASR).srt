1
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,480
okay

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:10,480
this is this is my worm bin

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,400
it's a bit of a mess but it works

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,000
i show you my rat problem first because

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
that's what i'm concerned about he's got

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
a tunnel there

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,640
you can see i don't know if you can see

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,719
that this camera

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,080
there's one right there and then there

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,518
was one right there

11
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,358
i think that i'm winning the battle

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:32,000
there's one here's another one

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,480
right here so yeah another

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,880
so yeah this just happened this winter

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,479
and i haven't had this issue before but

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,520
uh i am now and i'm

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,159
slowly taking care of it but uh i'm here

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,079
to talk to you about soil not rats

19
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,679
uh this is this is what falls out the

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,520
bottom of this thing this beautiful

21
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,920
stuff right here

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,199
smells great uh same here it's just

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,520
you know it's not perfect but it works

24
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,558
i grow some beautiful vegetables in this

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
stuff

26
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:08,719
and really i set this up uh

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,840
three years ago or more i guess i don't

28
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,879
i don't know what time of year it was

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,960
but thinking it was winter

30
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:21,280
it may be maybe four years ago now

31
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:24,719
anyway hey bud i designed this uh

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,040
after listening to uh coot's appearance

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,640
on the kiss podcast

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,079
with tad and as i was really inspired by

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,439
it because what he was saying was making

36
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,199
a lot of sense

37
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,118
so i didn't do it exactly the way that

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,240
he wanted i kind of

39
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,399
i wanted to make it last for years he he

40
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,399
said that he does his for about a year

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,399
and then collects all of the stuff out

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,640
of it but this one i wanted to

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
never turn a compost pile again because

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,079
that's how this started

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,799
as you can see it's all rotted out along

46
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:58,319
here you got exposed screws and [ __ ]

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,520
anyway this uh yeah i used to have to

48
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,679
turn this damn thing

49
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,599
all the time just keep it going i would

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,960
just flop it from side to side and

51
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,199
you know you get older and you don't

52
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,199
want to do that [ __ ] anymore so

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,439
i decided to do this way coot was

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,079
explaining and it's worked well so far

55
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,479
until this year with the rat problem but

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
uh

57
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,799
there's to show you how or kind of tell

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,039
you how i built it

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,840
is there's a probably a four foot pile

60
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,840
of rock

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,959
in the middle of this thing and then i

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,360
got these rock

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,800
wall sides on it so that it keeps

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,800
everything warm in the winter

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
so that because these these worms in

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,800
here are above ground

67
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:39,519
obviously and they uh

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,360
yeah they they have survived three years

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,480
now and they're obviously still in there

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
working because the

71
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,598
the pile drops even when it's got snow

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,160
on it

73
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,079
and uh the rats are in here eating them

74
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,199
all so

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,519
yeah so it's basically it was just

76
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,039
a four foot pile of rock in the middle

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,439
of it just a large pile of rock this

78
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,560
thing's probably eight by

79
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,959
five maybe six i don't know

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,479
never measured it really but yeah as i

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,598
know this is around eight

82
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:12,878
when i built this thing anyway

83
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:16,878
so uh yeah

84
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:20,079
rocks in the middle and then i just uh

85
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:22,399
piled some uh some

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,760
uh cow manure that had been sitting

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,039
around for a while

88
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,598
uh that cleaned out my chicken coop and

89
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,679
run

90
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,238
and just threw a bunch of yard waste in

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
here and it just got it going and it was

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,759
it was fired up and cooking right away

93
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,518
is it was amazing oh yeah and

94
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,199
of course the worms i ordered the worms

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,439
from uncle jim

96
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,439
i was got several pounds of that and i

97
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,158
got the night crawlers and the wigglers

98
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,280
threw them in there and yeah they've

99
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,199
they've been

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,120
rocking ever since reproducing doing

101
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,560
their thing and i've been loving the

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,158
results from it you can see what's

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,680
coming out of the bottom here

104
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,959
it's it is beautiful beautiful stuff

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,159
so yeah it smells amazing too i love

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,000
this time of year

107
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,120
so i guess there's not really any much

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,598
more anything else to say about this

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,120
it's a worm bin it's a big worm bin and

110
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,560
it works

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,560
enjoy your day
