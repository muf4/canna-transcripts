1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,599
hey tyler mr trees uh today we're

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:08,160
setting up a little garden vegetable box

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:10,160
and i wanted to give a little tip on uh

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,679
slug and snail prevention as well as

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,880
other bugs and stuff and show you kind

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,599
of what i do

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,199
to set up a little mini garden box so uh

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,240
first things first i get my

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,560
box

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,320
i get things planted seeds put in you

11
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,799
know et cetera et cetera

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,079
um and then i want to get it covered up

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,039
and i want to get it protected put a

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,358
barrier so i always set up

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,600
some copper tape

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,160
basically copper

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
is what's up buddy

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,718
doing your thing

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
so copper actually interferes with

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,840
that

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
yeah that's you look at you yeah yeah

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,160
rocking and rolling yeah we're talking

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,160
shh

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
so

25
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:56,640
copper actually uh interferes with

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,840
the slime of slugs and snails it gives

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,399
them this

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,399
electric shock or charge as they get

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,118
near it and try to cross over it kind of

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,599
like a an electric fence for a dog or a

31
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,920
cattle or chickens or whatnot it just

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,519
gives them that kind of jolt pisses them

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,920
off just enough to send them the other

34
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,000
direction doesn't kill them doesn't hurt

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,439
them just kind of lets them know that

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
they're not allowed to go in this little

37
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,758
area you don't have to re-apply it you

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,359
don't have to buy anything new you don't

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,118
have to use any types of products and

40
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,438
other things like that

41
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,400
ultimately you're just

42
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:33,279
sticking and forgetting and then your

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,040
your slug is now free so the copper

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,079
copper tape

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,600
comes from a lot of the different

46
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,438
nurseries

47
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,000
uh you can get it home depot you can

48
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,758
order it online you can do all kinds of

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,239
stuff but you just get a roll this

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,000
little tape here copper on one side and

51
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,280
it's a sticky back side here you just

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
peel it off

53
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,960
slightly and then

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
usually on the top of a garden box or

55
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,359
around any

56
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,359
rim of any pot

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,680
you can put it around anything it will

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,159
stick to most anything which is pretty

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,439
cool

60
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,159
and as soon as a slug or a snail

61
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,800
tries to pass over it

62
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,639
they will not be able to so

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,640
we just run this around the entire

64
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,119
top rim

65
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,840
or bottom rim or

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
whatever you want to do

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,598
and

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,599
you ensure

69
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,840
box

70
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,120
just like so

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,680
if it breaks off like it just did just

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
tape it back on

73
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,640
and you start working it

74
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,639
all the way

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,479
around the entirety

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,158
of the box and when we're done

77
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,158
it breaks off super easy

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
tuck it in the roll

79
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,959
and we're good to go

80
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,319
this box is now super protected now you

81
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,519
can go around and you want to press it

82
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,598
you want to make sure that you got it

83
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,239
stuck on there nice and

84
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,318
you can do some reinforcing of

85
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,200
you know various kinds to make sure that

86
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,199
it sticks perfectly but

87
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,798
that's essentially all you need to do

88
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,158
you don't have to reapply it you have to

89
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,879
do anything that's enough to piss off

90
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:58,039
anything so slugs and snails are taken

91
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,039
care of

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,280
next

93
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,280
we get some pvc pipe

94
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,158
and

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,159
the edges of all

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,199
get another one

97
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,758
about you know a foot

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,160
foot and a half

99
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
to two feet usually is where i start

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,160
setting them

101
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,439
every foot and a half two feet in the

102
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,439
ground it goes boom

103
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,478
two

104
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:52,079
turn that up as best you can

105
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,079
grab yourself another one

106
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,240
stacked in

107
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,240
stacked in

108
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,639
grab yourself another one

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,879
and you just do this

110
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,000
for however long your

111
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,000
boxer bed is

112
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
got another one

113
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,120
basically you're building a little

114
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,918
tunnel a little hoop

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
it doesn't even have to be crazy

116
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,000
or super secured unless you're in a real

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
windy area and then you can you can

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,918
pound these in and make them really nice

119
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,919
and tight

120
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,198
demonstration purposes we don't need to

121
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,719
do anything crazy like that then we get

122
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
my favorite thing in the world mosquito

123
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,400
netting

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,800
blocks out most

125
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,799
most pests

126
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,519
and

127
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,039
i'm not sure if this piece is going to

128
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,399
be big enough but i got lots of other

129
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,839
pieces here

130
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,038
but basically you get yourself a piece

131
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,038
that's going to cover your box

132
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,680
you can order it uh online

133
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,478
you can get it at fabric stores

134
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,478
stuff like this

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,079
and you basically

136
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,080
cover

137
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,800
cover up your box

138
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
you can throw a couple of bricks or

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,960
something on here to keep this down so

140
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,919
you can get in and out of it easily but

141
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,879
bang you got yourself a vegetable box

142
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,959
um

143
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,319
95 of pests

144
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,439
they're not going to be there they can't

145
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,680
get there

146
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,600
nothing get there through the air

147
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
nothing can kind of get through on the

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
underneath

149
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,280
so you're in great shape

150
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,159
you can kind of take extra precautions

151
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,679
and

152
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,680
tuck this around your tape and really

153
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,439
make it nice take some time or you don't

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,879
have to but i just wanted to throw it

155
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,199
out there just quick and easy it took us

156
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,639
just a few minutes set it up it's done

157
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,240
and over with i can walk away and not

158
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,199
really worry much

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,800

161
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,759
