1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,440
what's up fcp community

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,359
lobster fam farms here today i'm going

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,359
to show you my process of how i run

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,239
through a pack of seeds

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,239
let's get busy

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,640
to start i like to soak seeds for about

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,559
18 to 24 hours

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,160
you can use hydrogen peroxide or any

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,479
number of mixes

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,240
i like a drop of humic and a few drops

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,199
of some mellow enzyme into filtered

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,598
water

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,599
ph to about 6.0

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
a paper towel soap will work as well

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,679
just be cautious that your paper towel

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,440
doesn't dry out ruin your seeds you can

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,280
also put your seeds right into a cube or

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,799
right in the soil most techniques work

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,879
well

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,359
when your seeds have sprouted it's time

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,558
to carefully get them into your media

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,320
whatever media you're going to be

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,159
running for the long term

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,079
this is also a good opportunity to start

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,279
labeling your seeds so you can keep

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,280
track through the process

27
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,878
now i like to wait about six to eight

28
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,358
weeks before taking cuts

29
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,920
that way the hormones are really set

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,760
and my approach is i like to take two of

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
each mother plant

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,080
and this point keeping the labeling is

33
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,759
very very important so you want to make

34
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,039
sure you correlate your cuttings with

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,759
your mother plant accurately

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,080
now i'll take one of each plant and put

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,519
them into the bedroom to have genetic

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,359
backups

39
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,478
and then i'll take one of each of them

40
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,319
and put them into the flower room

41
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,759
now i like to put them in my room that's

42
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,758
almost done

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
that way just in case there is any rogue

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,319
pollen

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,680
that it's not really going to harm the

46
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,359
flowers

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,360
now that i've put my cuttings into the

48
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,560
flower room i should see results in

49
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,319
about seven to fourteen days

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
now you can see from these pictures how

51
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,478
clearly and concisely i can tell that

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,399
this is a male plant as opposed to the

53
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,399
mother plant that's just showing minimal

54
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,399
pre-flowers

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,399
and then from there i should have enough

56
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:09,840
data to know if i'm going to want to run

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,959
any of the cuttings further uh typically

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
on a 10 pack of seeds i'd say it takes

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,239
me

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,159
probably about 30 seeds to find one that

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,840
i actually keep so there's not a huge

62
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,318
likelihood that they'll be a super

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,159
winner for me at least for my criteria

64
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,079
uh these ones are interesting from nerds

65
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,318
genetics because they were bred for

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,160
solventless production which i think is

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,079
a very interesting because it's kind of

68
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,519
new and it still seems like a crap shoe

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
even if people are really breeding in

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
that direction it still seems like a low

71
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,079
likelihood that you'll get there

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
so

73
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,080
not only am i going to be monitoring

74
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,319
them for as i would harvesting flour or

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,319
just growing for flour it's also going

76
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,399
to have to be the next step once it gets

77
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,399
hit in the resin dial and gets tested to

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
see if it actually washes well

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,159
so this is kind of a new style of

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,560
testing for me but i'm very excited to

81
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,158
see to see the results

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
there's so many ways to run through seed

83
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,719
packs i find mine is very different as

84
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,119
where i don't expect any real production

85
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,039
of flour from the plant that came from

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,360
the actual seed

87
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,199
typically i like to not devote too much

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
room to unknown genetics so i'll just

89
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,280
flour the dixie cups as i was talking

90
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,640
about and usually i'll give the seed

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
plant once i've identified them as

92
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,238
females usually i'll just give it away

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,599
to someone else or as a gift or just

94
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,599
throw them wherever

95
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,798
and to me the real value in the future

96
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,560
is having the genetics and having it in

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,560
clone form and getting data from the

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,519
clone form since that's going to be the

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
future and uh since these were testing

100
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
strains i wouldn't feel right giving

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,200
them away so we're gonna bring them up

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,239
to an outdoor location and that will

103
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,560
help nerds get more data so not only can

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,200
we see how they do inside this year we

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,719
can also see how they react to the sun

106
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,560
and it will be a little bit skewed

107
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,120
because they're plants from seed but i

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,959
think they'll appreciate the sunshine so

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,080
a couple interesting side notes as i've

110
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,519
been running through these nerds

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,640
genetics packs

112
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,480
on the straw nana papaya

113
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,399
dr hoffman cross

114
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,399
out of the nine plants that made it out

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,280
of the 12 to this point

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,799
only one male so i have eight females to

117
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
run through which is a blessing and a

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,680
curse because i have a very good chance

119
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,239
of finding something special but i also

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,400
have a lot more data to go through and

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,638
another interesting side note was that

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,839
even though i was very accurate with my

123
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,439
labeling i labeled the two genetics very

124
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,839
differently all the ones that i had

125
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:34,079
labeled wz were actually the strongana

126
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:36,319
papaya and vice versa so mistakes happen

127
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,959
and it's all a process but now that i've

128
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,240
identified it i'll be able to reverse

129
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,000
them and i still have everything

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,720
correlated accurately so if i see

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,720
anything interesting i'll be able to

132
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
keep it for the future but i just

133
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
thought it was interesting that it's

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,120
always a process and i had been thinking

135
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,560
i had been finding it curious that

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
everyone else's wz's were the tall ones

137
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,478
and the fast growers and mine were the

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,560
only ones that were the sps that were uh

139
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,639
that were faster growing so now it makes

140
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,160
perfect sense it was an environment it

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,160
wasn't anything besides my mistake

142
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,639
all right then i hope you guys enjoyed

143
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,039
the process of how i run through seeds

144
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,439
as the nerds genetics start showing more

145
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,959
character and flower i'll be sure to try

146
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,639
to share with everyone whoever's

147
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,239
interested

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,400
keep in tune

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,840
lobster fam farms out

150
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,839
