us all of these flavors on the table

11
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,859
um and I think that just to frustrate

12
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,718
Peter we're starting with some form cut

13
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,339
Girl Scout cookies and then we're gonna

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,198
move into some really interesting stuff

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,460
but the Girl Scout cookies and I think

16
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,439
we can go around because we all smelled

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,239
it smelled really awesome but then here

18
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,819
there's some more land racy stuff and

19
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,920
it's just going to be a great sesh

20
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:09,359

00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:15,118
Scout on the Forum cut yes it was

23
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,640

24
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:21,420
um nutty coffee

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,960
Vibe and very sweet the cookies uh stood

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,019
out is just a it has such a foundation

27
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,339
as a as a like a tone I can't wait to to

28
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,920
smoke it I can't wait to see if it

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,460
translates I mean I bet it I bet it will

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,579
it's uh very impressive in how uh Rich

31
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:42,179
even for the amount in the bag it was

32
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,618
very like just invasive you know so I

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,020
love I love the terp that just gets

34
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:49,500
right in there and it's undeniably a

35
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,959
forum cut it's like it's so cookies I

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,180
love it it's like nutty and yeasty and

37
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,158
sweet and like vanilla it's just great

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,560
but also like mothbally it's real it is

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,259
really complex I'm stoked to try it but

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,820
you all were smelling stuff before

41
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,859
um we got here did anything else stand

42
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,859
out yeah oh

43
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:13,139
sorry the Lemon Cherry gelato that one

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,199
was so amazing it had like a very nice

45
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:18,000
vanilla kind of frosting smell so it was

46
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,919
really sweet and it really stood out to

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,659
me if you guys haven't smelled it then

48
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,000
definitely take a whiff right it's super

49
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,098
nice like delicate almost yeasty sort of

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,900
smell to it but I think this is a great

51
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:29,459
mix of stuff we have in front of us here

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,840
I think gold coaster next is a great job

53
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,979
presenting

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,239
um what he's known for what he's

55
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:35,219
passionate for with his land race

56
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,739
crosses present in the Colombian Haze

57
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:41,280
and the Albert Walker crosses we have

58
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,780
and some of the more new uh hyper stuff

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,818
you could call it like the Lemon Cherry

60
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,459
gelatos

61
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,839
um and everything else we have so let's

62
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,159
get into it I think we're rolling up

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,620
right now Otis what are we rolling up

64
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,079
form cut we're rolling up the Girl Scout

65
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,000
cookies Forum cut and then I think yeah

66
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,980
Jazz if you want to pick another one to

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,780
go in on yeah definitely

68
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,098
um you know we also have we have the

69
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,439
garlic skunk strain here this is the one

70
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,579
Pito is getting ripped on on 420 and

71
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,439
this is actually something unique

72
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,360
because we have the dry suit version and

73
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,759
rosin version of this as well

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,680
um that's something yeah we do so we

75
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,719
have three different variants of the

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,060
same strain and that's something unique

77
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,378
you very rarely get to see that so we'll

78
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,120
definitely get a chance to compare that

79
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,179
on the show today

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,180
um

81
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,840
yeah right now we're talking about the

82
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,739
garlic skunk so we have this in flower

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,860
form as well as rosin and dry sift form

84
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,319
so yeah right and it's it's very rare

85
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,180
that you get uh different forms of the

86
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,738
same cannabis flower so we're definitely

87
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,900
excited to tuck into that on the show

88
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,420
today and uh do a deeper dive on that so

89
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,819
we'll roll some of that up we uh

90
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:51,059
maybe we'll put some of the wax into the

91
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,378
joints and uh yeah the dry sift

92
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,979
definitely will put a garlic skunk

93
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:57,359
Square joint yeah a donut hell yeah yeah

94
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,798
um I mean this is such an amazing

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,659
selection I guess Jazz are you more

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,860
familiar with with golden ghost work and

97
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,378
sort of which one of these are

98
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,120
meaningful parts of a stable and as sort

99
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,919
of genetic Library

100
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,840
um just a little bit so I'm aware he's

101
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,639
very passionate him and Peter connect a

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,280
lot on the the land race side of things

103
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,139
and specifically uh just all across if

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,418
you look on what we have present here it

105
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,519
is mostly South American land race

106
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,859
crosses such as the Colombian hazes and

107
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,720
other variants of sort

108
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,660
um but it is cool because he does have

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,280
some Modern stuff too like uh as

110
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,160
mentioned before the Lemon Cherry gelato

111
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,779
the garlic skunk uh the manic kalio we

112
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,939
have a bunch of new stuff and we're

113
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,638
gonna tuck into it all but uh really

114
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,978
what I'm most excited for is there's a

115
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,079
Colombian Haze a somewhere here that

116
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,240
that smells ridiculous so definitely

117
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,120
want to tuck into that and see what the

118
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,620
experience will be like and um

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,600
Dave really has a wealth of knowledge

120
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,959
yet when I've seen him and Peter connect

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,300
um on YouTube it feels like there's a

122
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,519
really strong understanding of just what

123
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,660
makes quality and I kind of love to see

124
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,918
that there's someone who's like a

125
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,080
purveyor of

126
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,879
things like these equatorial hazes and

127
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,560
is also like yeah the form cut is good

128
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,478
enough that it makes the cut you know

129
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,120
like it there sort of isn't

130
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,459
any sort of biases it really is just

131
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,660
about quality exactly and I tend to find

132
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,279
that those

133
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,500
people of that mindset are the best

134
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,879
Growers yeah yeah

135
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,100
um I think everything we've examined

136
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,740
here so far uh whether it be old school

137
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,300
genetics or more new uh was all given

138
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,379
the same amount of love and care and you

139
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,939
can definitely tell them the end product

140
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:31,860
as you can tell by our reactions when

141
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,060
we're just going around right now

142
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,400
um so we'll definitely share this with

143
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,720
you and what we're thinking too

144
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,698
um but right now Gabe what do you think

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,160
about that joint man

146
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,780
first in hell is really nice it

147
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,120
definitely reminds me of cookies it has

148
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,918
that kind of gingerbready thing

149
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,439
you know the first hit the Cherry's

150
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,639
always a little hot yeah

151
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,620
but I'll have something to say about it

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,240
in a second but enjoyable smoke I mean I

153
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,560
certainly

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
um

155
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,000
I certainly think the dry pole was

156
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,759
really really flavorful

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,740
um there's just like a cookies is just

158
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,600
good comfortable neutral smoking weed

159
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,019
you know you want like when you have an

160
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,360
ounce of cookies you don't resent it by

161
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,099
the smalls at the bottom like you sort

162
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,120
of are just down to keep enjoying it

163
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,500
right

164
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,699
um

165
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,259
you know another thing's gonna be a

166
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,520
little more a little more difficult and

167
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,960
a little more challenging whereas I

168
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,698
would describe cookies as like the most

169
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,859
unchallenging

170
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,319
smoke and definitely a stable in

171
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,439
anyone's in anyone's uh stable it's

172
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,879
definitely a strain stable and

173
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,019
everyone's trying to collaborate at this

174
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,500

it was great to get to talk to Trevor

190
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,360
last week these sessions have just

191
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,460
become such a

192
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,038
such a cool meeting place for so many

193
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,959
people and that hash I mean I'm still I

194
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,019
still think that that hash from um

195
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,339
uplift uplifted Minds is so good some of

196
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,859
the best material I've ever seen and

197
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,719
they were out there on 422 at

198
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,400
um king of ZL it's

199
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,560
it's just awesome seeing Community come

200
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:35,478
together oh what do you think of that uh

201
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,478
kooky it's nice

202
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:42,299
the flavor profile is still developing

203
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:45,318
it's very enjoyable it's smooth

204
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,319
it's very kooky

205
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,038
and so Jazz did you want to get into the

206
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,538
hazes next or the kushes because I know

207
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,639
that the Albert Walker's in there too

208
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,759
and you mentioned it

209
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,759
yeah

210
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:02,639
oh yeah busy hands I was really

211
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:04,379
intrigued by that Albert Walker dogoji I

212
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,478
was told that Albert Walker is not a

213
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,519
Skywalker but rather something a little

214
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,659
bit older so just something I've never

215
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,240
seen before I was really curious about

216
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,800
it well I guess in the chat can you as

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,780
if the Albert Walker

218
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,978
is a part of the dog walker because I

219
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,198
feel like the dog walkers are really

220
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:22,079
popular one and I'm pretty sure that

221
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,060
it's just like chem X Albert Walker and

222
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,519
so it's really cool I mean I think

223
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,019
getting to try like known parentage like

224
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,098
I've never tried the Eddie lepo Jade

225
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,218
that's in so many things like getting

226
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:34,139
the opportunity to try these you know

227
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,520
meaningful parents is always really cool

228
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,879
to get to understand sort of the history

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,639
of popular Turf profiles

230
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,799
oh it's kind of lemony cheesy it's not

231
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,600
really a kush yeah it's it's very

232
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,338
interesting as a nose super fruity on

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
that one bro the nose on that is super

234
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,160
super nice did you guys get that kind of

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,480
like

236
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,480
the Albert Walker yeah

237
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,439
[Music]

238
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,120
no shade no like totally great all this

239
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,160
product is amazing all this stuff is

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,060
amazing but we were all interested we

241
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,860
were all interested in the difference

242
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:16,319
between the Tupperware versus the bag it

243
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,720
seems that the bag based on structure

244
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,060
quality nose

245
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,519
um seems like it's indoor work and then

246
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:26,278
there's there's this these Tupperware

247
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,019
that seems like it's depths and I'm not

248
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:29,519
throwing like depths are cool I don't

249
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,459
have any problems yeah some good weeds

250
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,539
also yeah outdoor full set and I guess I

251
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,919
don't think we've and I don't know if

252
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,719
we've had this conversation yet but I

253
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,579
mean mixed light makes for some of the

254
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,139
best hash on Earth I guess it does is

255
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,940
some of the best flower to depending on

256
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,220
strands it's all about genetics as well

257
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,200
and it Calio number six this one is one

258
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,820
of the most stinky ones I've smelled so

259
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,580
far that one smells great this isn't

260
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,580
Calio this is manic all right

261
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,220
but I think manic may be Peter and if I

262
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:00,480
don't know if there's something to pull

263
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,980
up or if it's seeds you sell but it

264
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,200
seems like manic is a running theme

265
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,720
around these jars so maybe that's like a

266
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,160
common parent yeah yeah um the Irene is

267
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,379
another one where like I've rarely seen

268
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,958
the Iran on its own but it's just in so

269
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,240
much definitely definitely

270
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:19,679
I'll roll that one up

271
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,299
yeah manic manic kalio number six that

272
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,019
one smells great there is there's a

273
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:24,019
there's an orange

274
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,680
we're gonna have to roll the lemon

275
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,299
charge gelato eventually we just have to

276
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,739
I think Louisville runs our life up at

277
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,120
the end definitely definitely I like

278
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,440
what we're doing right now where we're

279
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,000
switching it in with the land race and

280
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,040
then one of the newest trains and then

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,940
switching it back so yeah yeah it'll be

282
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:43,639
a good one

283
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,640
and so Peter is that say that again

284
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,370
[Music]

285
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:55,679
Peter was fresh press right that that

286
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:58,078
the Tupperware is mixed light and the

287
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:02,278

314
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,039
reminiscent of some kind of Mandarin

315
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,039
vibes

316
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,640

orange and chocolate yeah and it's like

332
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,219
it's like a chalky chocolate there's

333
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,399
another nugget right here to put in

334
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:12,259
there yeah chalk is for sure like chalky

335
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,259
is is a terp profile that will come out

336
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,220
wafers

337
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,919

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,579
enjoy it

344
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:37,578
I really do like it this is pretty

345
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:44,759
let me think okay definitely like I

346
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:50,039
smell that definitely that orangey

347
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:51,419
tangerine like creamsicle type for sure

348
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,299
this one also has kind of like that

349
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:56,578
light glaze the sweetness

350
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,319
I do like stuff like this

351
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,120
I really hope I can taste this that

352
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,100
would be a nice thing to do

353
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,639
let's do it

354
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,360
I always liked it

355
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,959
number six

356
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,959
right now

357
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,139
is that him no this is tobacco the

358
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,480
flavor really developed in this one I

359
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,860
like this is three five is what I'm

360
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,139
calling I needed to get halfway through

361
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,600
this before I could like uh

362
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,740
get that classic cookie flavor that's

363
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
what we were just saying is that the

364
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,459
mintiness really just came out and it's

365
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,920
so Jazz was just pointing out how smooth

366
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:38,719
it was yeah um yeah great job Dave so

367
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:41,939
far you're one for one on on the Triple

368
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,320
A is for sure and it's it's spooky with

369
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,079
the good cookie flavor and not the

370
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,800
doodoo musty flavor yep it's like that

371
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:52,379
that well well point of like gas that's

372
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,599
just well-rounded and not too obscure

373
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:55,559
but not too much either it's super well

374
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,180
balanced

375
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,179
I agree on that extremely smooth

376
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,179
likes

377
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,239
I like his I smoke them in the morning

378
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:10,379
and they'll get me lit I like the hazes

379
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,079
I've tried I like I think I've Haze

380
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:16,078
you know the best Haze I saw was pipco

381
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:20,899
screen Haze but I really don't know how

382
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:24,059
many of those like true 110 plus day

383
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:26,940
aquaponics grown in Miami type you know

384
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,859
like that really is it's something I'd

385
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,959
love to see more of

386
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,899
smoke some Haze rosin that's like some

387
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:37,198
real Haze or Haze like uh

388
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:40,940
uh yeah for sure like uh lower than my

389
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:43,078
Lifesaver like a dry Siff would be cool

390
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,760
I bet there's like some old heads who

391
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:47,299
have some stories about like Haze finger

392
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,259
hash or something bouncing it on screens

393
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:51,120
I mean it's like you have to be in a

394
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:53,338
very cold environment pretty much oh

395
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,480
yeah have you done dry stuff no I'm not

396
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,980
I just seen the internet you know and

397
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,778
um of course like the traditional way

398
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,000
that people make it which is pretty cool

399
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:04,500
like with these like endless amounts of

400
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,839
filtered

401
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,000
um screens and and like you know these

402
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,920
are people in Morocco or people making

403
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,500
this in Afghanistan or something like

404
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,599
that which is like super cool

405
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,740
um and like all the different varieties

406
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
and stuff that's super I mean every

407
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,159
Micron is different you know in the and

408
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,980
the way of course also again how it's

409
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,259
how it's constantly processed in like

410
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,019
certain seasons and stuff like that's so

411
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,879
cool to me you know it's like a very

412
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,799
ritualized event you know which I I like

413
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,919
a lot about a lot of weed stuff you know

414
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,539
it's the ritual the history well it's

415
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:38,099
also how things were originally sort of

416
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:40,198
like preserved and how Terps were

417
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,600
actually shared across the world was in

418
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,639
hash you know like how it can be

419
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,379
preserved yeah

420
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,720
um so I think we should on that note

421
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,578
definitely in the next joint oh you know

422
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,600
we should we should smoke what Peter

423
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:53,599
smoked on 420 next

424
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,638
and some of the rosin in it as well

425
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:08,759
we have rosin dry sift and flower of the

426
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,679
same form and from the same person as

427
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,599
well if you like check it out yes I was

428
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,280
very impressed I was very impressed by

429
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,159
the dry sift

430
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:20,338
um it looks really nice it's sticky uh

431
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,919
it it just you can the like when you're

432
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:26,220
breathing it in the the way that it

433
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,900
invades and fills the sinus and

434
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,819
everything is like do you want to hold

435
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,240
them up super

436
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:36,119
has it just it is full it is like a jazz

437
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,220
cam the Jazz cam is that what this cam

438
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,819
is right here

439
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:44,220
it's currently aimed at use look at this

440
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:46,339
I mean it's pretty it's pretty I mean

441
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,339
it's

442
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,559
green but I mean like dry stuff is dry

443
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,500
sift you know it's like you're removing

444
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,759
certain size heads and it's doesn't mean

445
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,099
just because it's green doesn't mean

446
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,900
it's bad it's not tricep or is that I

447
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:02,399
thought it was oh all right I guess well

448
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,640
I guess I wasn't assuming it was bubble

449
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,919
hash no I mean it I mean it kind of is

450
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,480
it depends on it's basically dried this

451
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,038
is cured already I should I'm pretty

452
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,160
sure it's cured

453
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:17,220
um you know usually dry sift has to be I

454
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,960
mean it it but it's um you know it's

455
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,298
like I don't know if this is from his

456
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,900
trim bin or whatever but but I I hope

457
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:27,000
he's it is from his trim bin

458
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,100
very clean trim bin very nicely done

459
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,200
very clean but I'm I'm excited about

460
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:35,279
that it has such a I mean uh Streisand

461
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,860
yeah it's very very rich

462
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,940
um kind of has some like gassy notes to

463
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,139
it

464
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,440
um

465
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:46,440
yeah it's it's herbal

466
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,500
can I check it out for you yeah

467
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,320
it's got some like uh Sweet Lemon notes

468
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,759
to it I mean there's it's I was

469
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,839
impressed I was like into it have you

470
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,819
ever played around with any skunk

471
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:01,939
genetics do they wash uh yes they do

472
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:01,939
um

473
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,200
I haven't personally Percy washed but

474
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:09,720
I've heard good numbers about some of

475
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,120
their genetics I'm trying to think what

476
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,140
would be the greatest that I've seen by

477
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,579
them

478
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,520
oh I was just talking about like skunk

479
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:19,079
one type cultivars but also yeah yeah oh

480
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,019
I think I think you're saying like skunk

481
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,399
house genetics

482
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:24,599
yeah yeah no they're I know they're

483
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,460
they're worth watching they have great

484
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,339
genetics for washing

485
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,840
um but uh I don't know I actually I

486
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,119
haven't I haven't watched any song

487
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:36,298
genetics but I'd be down I'd be down

488
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:39,000
bring me bring them to me bring me your

489
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:41,220
fresh frozen yeah and we will do first

490
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,200
for the science for the community

491
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,700
I think it's only right that we put the

492
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,640
lemon charge a lot on the blind yeah

493
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,860
that's cool are we are we is the

494
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,360
hospital gonna be the blood no no no the

495
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:53,399
hash oil has to be in a junk we have to

496
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,879
taste the colors

497
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,140
I agree all right

498
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,200
okay it's like now you're getting picky

499
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,660
yeah no um sorry I love blunts they're

500
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,460
uh they're guilty pleasure I really

501
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,279
can't beat them man okay well Lemon

502
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,640
Cherry and a blunt is it's like the 20th

503
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,639
century

504
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:16,139
God

505
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,000
it's Timeless a blunt is times but Lemon

506
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,720
Cherry in the blunt I would say that's a

507
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,720
rather new trend

508
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,400
that's not on the paper I don't know

509
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,319
anybody nobody nobody you can smoke

510
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,559
Lemon Cherry gelato in a blunt in any

511
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,558
state

512
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:46,079
this is an interesting one to go around

513
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,759
the table is lemon tree a lot gelato

514
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,500
runs answer your say what you were gonna

515
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,879
say and then answer the question but is

516
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,679
Lemon Cherry gelato runs it's a question

517
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,600
aren't opposed to the room well first I

518
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,340
was going to say well putting the Lemon

519
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,019
Cherry gelato in a blunt it kind of

520
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,058
tastes takes away from that flavor of it

521
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,160
and that's why it goes great in the

522
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,619
paper or a cone or you know in a bong

523
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,600
hit like a solid rip because you can

524
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:08,219
really get that Rush of that flavors and

525
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,579
like I don't know it just lights off the

526
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,620
terpenes and in a magical way 100 agree

527
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,000
with that statement however this is

528
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,479
superior tobacco this is a Brother's

529
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,480
broadleaf

530
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:29,280
well the pink Z really came out so I I

531
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,899
have faith in it just because the pink Z

532
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,279
I can really taste the flavor of that so

533
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,919
that was really nice you can really

534
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,519
still taste the fruitiness of it so I'll

535
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,520
give it to you

536
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,579
um he said he had it was a pink Z that

537
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,980
that was in the last bone Daniel was a

538
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,918
was a was it Pinky

539
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,380
was the pink the pink zebra yes shout

540
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,360
out to don't don't panic

541
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,860
it's hard we smoked on 420 it was good

542
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,779
yes we did we smoked the fruit zoops as

543
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:56,759
well but I guess and I'm curious what do

544
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,379
people think about because I agree that

545
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,640
it's super flavorful to me it is very

546
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,919
similar to runs but there's something

547
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,240
it's obviously a different Fino but is

548
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,299
it the same

549
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,099
thing or is it or is it just a gelato

550
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:12,119
Fino like people say is it a 33 bag seed

551
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:14,158
I think it's very close to the cake

552
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,759
because a lot of times you get

553
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,760
I think

554
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:21,240
I think it's closer to cake just because

555
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,100
you get that um that like that sweetness

556
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,500
and then also you get that like that

557
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:27,658
dark purplish normally with those like

558
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,519
orangish hairs so you get that nice

559
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:31,980
little combo which you really see in a

560
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,558
lot of the cake mixtures so I definitely

561
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,839
really like the gelatos more than the

562
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,359
runs personally

563
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:43,319
I think it's runs I think it tastes like

564
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:47,038
runs it tastes like a floral like fruit

565
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:52,319
punch yogurt uh or like some kind of

566
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:54,960
yeah funky funky old milk Vibe with and

567
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,240
yeah you know and I think that that's

568
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,919
pretty consistent amongst all all of

569
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,140
them I've tasted and I know a lot of

570
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,759
people rename everything this and by so

571
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,280
I've but I've you know it's been around

572
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,079
it's been around but I'm I'm gonna be

573
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,000
very straightforward I'm not a runs fan

574
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,000
really not

575
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,859
um certain gelatos I do enjoy a lot

576
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,440
um 41 you know that's great you know

577
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,240
everyone's a classic always so good in a

578
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,500
blunt oh so good in a blunt but I think

579
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,940
one of the stories about Lemon Cherry

580
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,619
gelato the one that is other than it

581
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,919
being runs is that it was a connected

582
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:27,359
bloody one bag 41 bags seed yep and like

583
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,700
who knows they're so similar and so

584
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:33,240
closely related regardless but it's a

585
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,700
fun one yeah it is the mythology of runs

586
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,500
versus so right now we're rolling up the

587
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,880
uh

588
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,980
the manic kalio number six which tastes

589
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,419
like Japanese food which is interesting

590
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,919
because you know tastes like Chinese

591
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,020
food

592
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,580
food yeah this one's Japanese food soy

593
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,619
sauce this one this one tastes like

594
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:55,319
seaweed salad

595
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:57,359
Umami yes Umami yeah

596
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:59,579
yeah which is present in a lot of stuff

597
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,899
yeah I love that I love that's one of my

598
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,918
favorite

599
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,900
um

600
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,299
finding like that kind of like kimchi

601
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,538
note that's in food too or in weed too

602
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:12,720
is super delicious well and I also feel

603
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:14,158
like because like it you you are more

604
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,259
attuned to seeing it in things that

605
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,820
people described in more purely desserty

606
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,980
tones I forget what it was that we were

607
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:21,178
looking at recently and I was thinking

608
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,798
of it as just like a straight dessert

609
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,860
profile and then you very astutely

610
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,690
called out that there were some of those

611
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,259
yeah

612
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,419
[Music]

613
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,379
yeah

614
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:32,640
something I think it might have been a

615
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,860
skittles cross which you know you don't

616
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,020
normally think about that being in

617
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:41,158
Skittles But Mommy it's there

618
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,500
it's good the flavor is translating

619
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,720
there's not like Tootsie Roll Tootsie

620
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,298
Pop that you were talking about

621
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,798
um there's like a

622
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:51,240
kind of like a condensed milk thing but

623
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:53,700
then also kind of like a seaweed salad

624
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,038
like like

625
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,720
like good seaweed solid with like sesame

626
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,400
oil maybe it's a sesame oil thing I'm

627
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,440
tasting more than seaweed but the

628
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:06,000
condensed milk is that Umami yeah

629
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,860
but you crushed that to script like that

630
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,179
oh yeah hell yeah taste that you're

631
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:11,399
gonna you're gonna get that condensed

632
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:13,860
milk for sure it's good it's more sesame

633
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,700
oil than seaweed solid I didn't realize

634
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:20,099
that one was manic this one number six

635
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,980
yeah oh here you go well because because

636
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,899
said condensed milk to me it totally

637
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,038
just tastes like a less sweet Thai iced

638
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,778
tea yeah like a less overtly sugary yeah

639
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:31,859
that's awesome Max I kind of like this

640
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:33,960
one

641
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:36,798
yeah I like that I would sit on that

642
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,038

so this one has a spectacular look super

646
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,080
tracked out a lot of pistols on it

647
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:51,418
because the perps because the color has

648
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,980
the smell to it like we said

[ __ ]

696
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:33,979
sour Dairy note with like the acidic

697
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:37,440
very acidic uh whereas you taste the

698

Tangerine in this you know but it's also

699
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,940
very acidic which I think is the

700
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,860
relationship with also the the like

701
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,440
ponzu or something like something that

yeah this one the number three is way

737
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,579
stickier than the number six the number

738
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,360
six was uh uh maybe just more far along

739

in the dryer or something

740
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:42,959
butyric acid is what contributes to that

741
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:45,179
butyric acid butyric acid is what is and

742
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,899
it's very common in a lot of the gelato

743
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,899
progenie

744
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,538

notes I'm getting it's very different

979
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,079
from some lemon Church letters I can't

980
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,460
tell how much of this from the blunt but

981
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,200
it is like a good bounce like you said

982
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,699
like that honey note with the slight

983
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,679
nuttiness of source you get from the

984
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:33,239
Gelato and then just that General floral

985
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,159
sweetness as well without like that

986
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:37,019
sickly sweetness you know that sometimes

987
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,819
you get from some variants of Lemon

988
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:40,440
Cherry gelato so but it also doesn't

989
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,780
have the peppery note that happens when

990
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,000
you take it too long like decidedly so I

991
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,859
think there's it's pretty dialed it's

992
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,880
done very very well yeah he runs his

993
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:49,880
life up that's for sure

994
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:55,319
it's safe to say we here at FCP believe

995
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,559
Lemon Cherry gelato and runs are the

996
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,559
same thing

997
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,660
what's next all right we got to do this

998
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:07,199
are we gonna do the walk the the dog

999
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:09,179
walker Albert dog walker

1000
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,219
I like that that had also some very

1001
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:13,500
cakey Vibe

1002
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:16,439
um I like the way it looks it has a

1003
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,780
great structure and big fat nug both of

1004
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,920
them big old nugs

1005
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,079
um

1006
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,940
a lot of trichomes on the leaves on the

1007
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,500
Sugar Leaf that was left there which I

1008
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,720
also have to say I like your trimming

1009
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,320
style that's always a you know

1010
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:32,939
indication of of uh headiness I think

1011
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,920
you know

1012
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,780
it's the presentation

1013
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,800
perhaps and I think that it is you know

1014
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,720
a lot of

1015
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,680
when I get stuff directly from Growers a

1016
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,699
lot of the times they give it to me on

1017
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:42,960
trim and they're like this is how I'd

1018
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:45,358
want it

1019
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,820
like you do that yourself

1020
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,259
it's a little annoying but I get it I

1021
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,760
just finger tripping man but for the

1022
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,020
preservation of the I do think it

1023
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,240
preserves the trichomes I think there's

1024
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,579
something to be said about

1025
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,838
whatever that is and it's like so so

1026
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:59,280
like everyone has a different visual

1027
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:00,838
appearance preference right some prefer

1028
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,460
some sugar leaves some prefer a lot of

1029
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:04,039
sugar leaves some prefer none some

1030
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,780
prefer

1031
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,980
some people like the

1032
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,780
the

1033
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,619
some people like the holes in their buds

1034
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,619
from the machines

1035
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,460
yeah yeah

1036
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,039
I think I think we all agree here like a

1037
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,920
more delicate thoughtful trim is better

1038
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:25,920
than a little shave an LA pack shave and

1039
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,420
trim for the win or rubs your life then

1040
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,818
sending your pack to the barber yeah

1041
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,818
yeah literally the washing machine

1042
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,260
you ever guys ever run one of those

1043
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:39,500
machines you guys have any experience

1044
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,660
with tumblers those are lit dude

1045
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:45,380
no trim machines oh no I haven't dude

1046
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:47,699
trim machines are ridiculous man

1047
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,640
how they're not covering the [ __ ] yeah

1048
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:53,039
it's you gotta you gotta have this the

1049
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:55,679
way they've met I don't know what

1050
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,960
originally was for like shucking peanuts

1051
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,098
or something automative you know it's so

1052
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,559
I feel like it's definitely something

1053
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:03,240
that's taken from the AG world like and

1054
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:04,920
thrown into the Cannabis world and how

1055
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,618
they how they decided to just like

1056
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,599
tumble trim this stuff thinking it would

1057
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,039
work I feel like they never tried it and

1058
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,240
then seeing people do it like wet no

1059
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:13,858
like oh you're supposed to do it wet

1060
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,318
like there's all this myth like how it's

1061
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:18,598
done the best and it's like it's all bad

1062
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,759
it's a fundamental misunderstanding it's

1063
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:24,119
like the fruit isn't the plant matter

1064
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,380
it's the resin yeah like it's a CL the

1065
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,660
principles might work from an

1066
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:31,338
agricultural perspective yeah

1067
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:31,338
Chads that don't know what they're doing

1068
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,719
we Boomerang to the Lemon Cherry

1069
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:03,659
this tastes

1070
00:45:01,338 --> 00:45:05,099
similar to the number six with that

1071
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,420
Sesame note but there's something

1072
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,980
different about this that I haven't

1073
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,680
discovered

1074
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,300
it's almost less uh

1075
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:14,519
the number three is almost like less

1076
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,940
condensed milky more like sesame oil

1077
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:19,980
Chinese foodie but it has the it has the

1078
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,619
elements of like

1079
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:25,500
um elements of orange essence of orange

1080
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:28,500
but definitely like a like you just hit

1081
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,539
some sesame oil for sure like at the

1082
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,358
Korean barbecue you know what I'm saying

1083
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:36,739

00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:41,179
Hibachi yeah exactly bro

1085

1089
00:45:54,539 --> 00:46:00,539
that's number three AKA Chinese food

1090
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:02,460
this one is peppery but also has less

1091
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:04,800
more floral yeah it's more floral it's

1092

00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:04,019
very sticky chocolate Vibe almost has

1153
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:07,079
like cushy kind of stuff going on

1154
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:09,239
number two this is really nice to get to

1155
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:12,539
smoke two fianos side by side to just

1156
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:14,639
see how the variation between the

1157
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:16,800
genetics right as we've had guests speak

1158
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,379
about it before something that truly is

1159
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,060
uh so wide in terms of the variables

1160
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,280
you're playing with and the traits that

1161
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:25,318
that can run down and and so to find

1162
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,900
Keepers is you know people really do

1163
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:29,818
underestimate how hard it is and we get

1164
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,220
to participate somewhat through these

1165
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:34,139
these small little different variances

1166
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,879
of females would get and and it really

1167
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:38,159
is hard to find a keeper or just truly

1168
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,380
pick one that you think everyone would

1169
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,578
enjoy uh and so I think through this

1170
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,079
we've also developed a lot of respect

1171
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,640
for The Growers and breeders who are

1172
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,240
able to do these in and pick winning

1173
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,920
crosses and bring them to Market

1174
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:51,838
wow this um

1175
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,818
laughing gas might be my favorite nose

1176
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,739
we've had yeah so so the laughing gas

1177
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:57,539
was honestly I thought like all

1178
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:59,039
sweetness without that gelato knows did

1179
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:00,239
you smoke at all no we have not yet

1180
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,920
actually but when we're passing it

1181
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:03,539
around originally this was and I believe

1182
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,920
this is one of the newer genetics as

1183
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:10,259
well so uh this looks to be indoor run

1184
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,119
smells amazing uh what do you guys think

1185
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:14,280
about this laughing gas that one smells

1186
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:16,920
awesome

1187
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:21,000
you see this super D fire

1188
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:23,519
super deep fire Albert walker dog

1189
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,838
I think I smelled this do I got that dog

1190
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,480
in it

1191
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:29,940
it's not that dog in it okay shot that

1192
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,980
dog walker

1193
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,900
like mosquito spray

1194
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:37,639
oh like citronella

1195
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,639
all right that's a good one

1196
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:43,280
which one was that oh The Laughing Gas

1197
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,280
yeah

1198
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:49,578
right the laughing gas is the one

1199
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:55,940
we got a Lysol flavor right here it's

1200
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:59,359
like Lemon Pledge but more pledge

1201
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:02,280
Albert walker dog oh yes

1202
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:04,799
it reminds me of some weird Batman [ __ ]

1203
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,019
that one's crazy it's like a Batman

1204
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,660
straight laughing gas I don't know why

1205
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:11,579
Heath Ledger I see Heath Ledger

1208
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:19,380

you stashers

1265
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:49,858
if you want all your rosin to go really

1266
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:51,419
dry crazy to say but I accidentally

1267
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:53,578
forgot that there was rosin on here and

1268
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,800
I flew home to uh South Carolina last

1269
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:57,180
week with rosin in my dab eggs so I

1270
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,580
definitely could have taken a rip in the

1271
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:02,669
smoking section of the airplane

1272

[Music]

1273
00:54:04,818 --> 00:54:07,619
I knew it was in there on the way home

1274
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:08,940
so I was like man I could just go out in

1275
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:11,338
California and do like the cigarette

1276
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:14,220
smoking area and take a dab X rib for a

1277
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:16,380
pre-flight so funny so dank when I was

1278
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:18,899
in Ohio there was they would have these

1279
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:21,619
like enclosed almost like phone booths

1280
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,619
so you'd have to go

1281
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:27,480
it sends us a picture from inside one of

1282
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:28,500

and it's it's delicious it is so

1338
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,159
elongated and

1339
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,659
um like it is a very unique blood

1340
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:09,679
structure but the high itself is just

1341
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:12,899
something that is so great

1342
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:14,338
that's some sticky dry stuff I have some

1343
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,079
dry sift that I've been saving from

1344
00:57:14,338 --> 00:57:17,759
various harvests in my freezer like

1345
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,740
probably like a pound and a half of dry

1346
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,680
sift from like Harvest when I was

1347
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:25,139
working at a bigger like facility and

1348
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:27,239
it's a lot of GMO but it's some of it is

1349
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:29,098
some of it is really carefully sifted

1350
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:32,578
and it's all just like melty like this

1351
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:35,039
it's all dabble varying grades of you

1352
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:36,480
know debris behind three stars yeah I

1353
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:38,420
got some three stars got some two and a

1354
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,740
half stars

1355
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:42,300
with a half star fam that's what

1356
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:45,539
hashiness is it's some of these

1357
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:48,539
combusted you know materials that makes

1358
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:50,039
up like what it is you know exactly and

1359
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:51,300
like you can refine it too that's why I

1360
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:53,039
have it in my freezer still I've got

1361

01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:17,159
similar to GMO and chem

1462
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,559
um you know I think that probably comes

1463
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:22,440
from the garlic part of the lineage

1464
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:25,079
um and then some lemon from the skunk

1465
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:28,798
um it was like you know GMO without the

1466
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:30,180
full body and like uh like a lemony chem

1467
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,039
without like some of the more like

1468
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:33,298
bitter cam notes which is really

1469
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,318

1470
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:37,500

1474
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:47,039

1475
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:50,640

like more more funky skunky bitter than

1478
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:57,119
like GMO even like we called it we were

1479
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:59,579
like joking we were like we should just

1480
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,619
like call this like new GMO but it's bad

1481
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:03,480
it's uh

1482
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:05,579
it deserves it's it's better than that

1483
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,000
not better than GMO but it deserves its

1484
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:08,000
own life

1485
01:03:13,338 --> 01:03:17,639
and I think that the breeder behind that

1486
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,140
is having a moving sale so if anyone's

1487
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:21,239

1550
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:45,059
rolling joints yeah I mean I could roll

1551
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,500
a joint I could packing cones how many

1552
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:49,859
people cannot roll how many people could

1553
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:52,500
roll here I can roll I mean not like I

1554
01:06:49,858 --> 01:06:56,119
can't roll like you but you know this

1555

guy can roll yeah how do you pack a film

1556
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:00,679
[Music]

1557
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:10,380
no but there's but really it is a

1558
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:12,960
properly rolled joint

1559
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:15,260
elevates the smoking experience so much

1560
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,699
and I uh you just crush it every time

1561
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:20,280
and I think you want to talk about sort

1562
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:22,618
of the dimensions that you go for the oh

1563
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:25,200
yeah I mean um

1564
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:26,579
for me I think

1565
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:28,379
um rather than rolling like a long

1566
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:30,059
skinny joint with the same amount of

1567
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,680
weed you can roll a shorter fatter joint

1568
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:34,140
where there's more surface area that's

1569
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:36,239
being vaporized and smoked throughout

1570
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:38,098
the whole joint for the front of the

1571
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:40,979
joint is going to be smoked back of its

1572
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:43,200
vaporized from the hot air and Hot Smoke

1573
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:45,119
um uniform Dimensions I mean you can

1574
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:46,798
roll cones and stuff but you know

1575
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,440
whatever's easiest for you I like the

1576
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:51,059
uniformity it burns uniform

1577
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,740
um you don't want it to be too tight you

1578
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:54,059
want to be able to draw I like to use a

1579
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:55,199
couple crutches

1580
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:57,900
right

1581
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:59,639

1587
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:09,660
feels as sturdy out as a glass tip out

1588
01:08:07,858 --> 01:08:11,338
of like four crutches but then again

1589
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:12,480
people claim that the crutches have a

1590
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:14,578
flavor to them

1591
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,859
that's real for me I just like I'll roll

1592
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:18,900
like a fat joint with no no tip at all

1593

Tetris I will say that the first smoke

1645
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:29,100
of the day event and the bright The

1646
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:30,658
Vibes that you brought that was one of

1647
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:33,420
the coolest things this year such a cool

1648
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:35,399
way to kick off the air yeah

1649
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:37,560
um that was really amazing actually I

1650
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:39,000
didn't go to that one I was literally I

1651
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,219
think I was literally out of the state

1652
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,539
but the Vibes were so apparently bombed

1653
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:46,640
that I could feel it through Instagram

1654
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:46,640
so they're radiating vibes

1655
01:10:55,698 --> 01:11:00,059
and notice you you barred this joint and

1656
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,620
um

1657
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:03,060
once again we just want to emphasize

1658
01:11:01,619 --> 01:11:05,579
it's very rare that you get the

1659
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:08,460
opportunity to try uh different versions

1660
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:09,840
of the same strain and so thank you once

1661
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,219
again Golden Coast genetics for

1662
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,319
providing this opportunity with the

1663
01:11:11,219 --> 01:11:15,539
garlic skunk and I'm pretty sure this

1664
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:19,519
torch is super loud right now but we

1665
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:19,519
love hot dabs so I'm not complaining

1666
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,640
the

1667
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:26,760
the gunk is I just described as like

1668
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,900
super GMO super gym White Rhino laughing

1669
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,940

is that a white rhinocross the laughing

1671
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:35,719

1672
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,719

right should we smoke the uh The

1674
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:42,899
Laughing Gas we should maybe roll up the

1675
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:45,140
Laughing ass first and then the next one

1676
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:45,139

is there somebody selling laughing gas

1679
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:56,520
at this event I think we should get

1680
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:57,859
somebody doing that potion man maybe two

1681
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,500

1682
01:11:57,859 --> 01:12:03,238

01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:09,859

1686
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:09,859

three for 20 man jeez

1693
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:37,439
I think Super G mode would be the best

1694
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,819
way to describe this but once again with

1695
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:41,698
all the flavors we've been able to try

1696
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:44,039
today just very well done super mature

1697
01:12:41,698 --> 01:12:46,319
grown smoke

1698
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:48,600
and I think the dry sift actually has

1699
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:50,460
like I had a really unique component to

1700
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,800
the similar almost to like

1701
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:54,779
did I say a full metal hassle of sorts

1702
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,940
in terms of like the the upliftedness

1703
01:12:54,779 --> 01:13:00,859
I'm feeling in the in the smoothness

1704
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:00,859
and Slow Burn of the studio as well

1705
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:06,079
that nail reps

1706
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:06,079
that's a clouder

1707
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:14,060
that's for taking rippers

1708
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:14,059

everybody

1713
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,380
Gold Coast might need a part two there's

1714
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,579
so much weight on this table we still

1715
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:37,579
have not even tried

1716
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:42,678

1717
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:45,738

01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:54,419
GMO with the GMO

1721
01:13:51,738 --> 01:13:56,819
yeah I think it's more effervescent it's

1722
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:58,920
like uh in the rosin you're getting more

1723
01:13:56,819 --> 01:14:01,738
of like the like lemony skunky like

right now like you said it's it's those

1728
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:13,860
lights almost effervescent is the best

1729
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:16,619
way to describe it yeah it sort of

1730
01:14:13,859 --> 01:14:21,019
Glides over yeah like champagne bubbles

1731

1836
01:19:24,979 --> 01:19:31,879

two-part everyone's already too high

1838

[Music]

1842
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:48,500
Lemon Cherry gelato I think was still

1843
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:48,500
one of my favorites

1844
01:19:49,979 --> 01:19:53,819
what was your guys's favorite strength

1845
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:56,759
you guys tried the cookies I'm smoking

1846
01:19:53,819 --> 01:19:59,299
on cooking you smoking on mild whoa I

1847
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,300
like that yeah

1848
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:04,199
the Garlic's gone

1849
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,140
that [ __ ] was hitting

1850
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:08,939
humongously

1851
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:10,619
I'm gonna be cliche but I I think for me

1852
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:13,139
it was a Lemon Cherry gelato that one

1853
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:15,539
kind of took me by surprise and uh

1854
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:17,400
so far at least it was it was the one I

1855
01:20:15,539 --> 01:20:18,779
enjoyed the most out of all these

1856
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:20,519
but I'm also partial because I like

1857
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:22,619
blunts so

1858
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:25,020
we'll leave that be I think the garlic

1859
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:28,439
skunk was also phenomenal too so that

1860
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:30,620
would be my flower take I'm a a big GMO

1861
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:30,619
fan

1862
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:41,698
I like the Calio manic Calio the two or

1863
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:43,679
the three uh I like the six the six

1864
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:44,939
words so you were saying the six was the

1865
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:46,920
one with more citrus chips or less

1866
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:50,639
Citrus terms six was more like condensed

1867
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:53,819
milk like uh like more like more intense

1868
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:55,619
lactic vomity condensed milk like the

1869
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:57,299
sort of like rotten milk sort of smoke

1870
01:20:55,619 --> 01:21:00,658
the six first yeah then the number three

1871
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:03,739
was more citrusy more floral it's not

1872
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:03,738
necessarily more citrusy

1873
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,239
