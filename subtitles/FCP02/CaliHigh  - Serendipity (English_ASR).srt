35
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:51,839
after coming home from Jamaica in 1975 I

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,420
rented a room in a house in Laurel

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,740
Canyon owned by a guy named Reuben who

38
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,200
had made his fortune as a clothing

39
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,140
designer with a small shop on the Sunset

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,879
Strip during the 60s and who now rented

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,799
out the rooms in his house

42
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,839
the house was on little Laurel Canyon

43
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,280
between the Canyon Country Store and

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,200
Mount Olympus Drive

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,840
there were two girls and a guy renting

46
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,060
rooms in the house as well

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,039
one of the girls was named Molly Harper

48
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,199
a pretty Midwest girl from Peoria

49
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,500
Illinois who had moved to Hollywood in

50
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,780
search of a more Cosmopolitan lifestyle

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,159
while living at Rubens I sold cannabis

52
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,979
to make a living

53
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,780
Molly Harper had no job apparently but

54
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:34,019
liked to shop and go to auctions

55
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,159
exhibits and museums she also liked fine

56
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,500
dining

57
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,840
she read voraciously and while never

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,780
having attended college she was well

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,239
educated she drove a powder blue Volvo

60
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,259
and frequently wore a long black pleated

61
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,099
Kenzo dress with gray shoulder straps

62
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,560
she called the Kenzo dress her uniform

63
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,780
[Music]

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,159
Molly was fun to hang out with and had a

65
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,780
great sense of style and was

66
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,000
knowledgeable in the Fine Arts and Music

67
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,219
we hit it off

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,159
she turned me on to David hockney Robert

69
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:08,280
rauschenberg and George Gershwin she was

70
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,199
22 and I was 19.

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,539
I eventually found out the source of

72
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,219
Molly's money which had been a well-kept

73
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,019
secret and a mystery to the others in

74
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:17,939
Reuben's house

75
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,280
Molly had collected a bunch of money

76
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,199
from a settlement after being hit by a

77
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,539
Cadillac while on her Vespa

78
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,459
the impact broke her femur and Center

79
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,318
flying 100 feet

80
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,598
the mystery of Molly's money remained

81
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,818
unknown to me however until we went into

82
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,818
business together

83
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:38,219
Reuben's house was a wild Affair Reuben

84
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,199
was an older Argentinian gay man with a

85
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:43,259
tall young Afro-American lover named Don

86
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,818
who lived in the house with ribbon on

87
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,318
the weekends the whole house would go

88
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:48,658
out to gay bars in Santa Monica

89
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:52,798
Boulevard and as I was interested in

90
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:54,780
Mali I would go along it was a wild time

91
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,879
I was always pretty sure I was the only

92
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,098
straight guy in the club which didn't

93
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,518
seem to matter and I had a blast with

94
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,518
the girls

95
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,420
one day in late spring of 76 I got a

96
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,699
call from Rick hirschman it had been

97
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,619
about a year since we had met and hung

98
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,598
out at his now famous Rick's Cafe in

99
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,239
Negril Jamaica

100
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,639
Rick was now calling from Miami and said

101
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,280
he had good Colombian and did I want to

102
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,720
come to Miami and pick up a load I said

103
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,299
sure

104
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,919
for a while Molly had been watching my

105
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,240
business and was thinking about a

106
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,560
partnership to keep her money from

107
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,600
dwindling

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,418
this was the perfect time

109
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,790
we became 50 50 partners and by that

110
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,258
time we were also lovers

111
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,720
[Music]

112
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,300
I arranged the deal with Rick and bought

113
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,240
two brand new blue Samsonite suitcases

114
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,139
the kind with the three-digit combo lock

115
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,759
took a bunch of cash and flew to Miami

116
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,379
Rick picked me up at the airport and

117
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,879
went back to a house on a canal

118
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,680
somewhere in an affluent Miami

119
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,079
neighborhood

120
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,540
the sunlight was so bright tropical and

121
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,740
blue kind of blew my mind compared to

122
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,740
the California sunshine

123
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,699
foreign

124
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,220
grade greenish Brown Colombian who

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,259
wasn't the best but it was good I paid

126
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,600
365 per pound

127
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,879
the block wasn't too pressed the buds

128
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,660
were uniform and intact and in fact they

129
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,639
had a pleasant flavor and were strong

130
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,220
we took apart the bail in sections

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,978
sealed them up in black trash bags and

132
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,720
packed them into the two suitcases Rick

133
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:35,939
drove me back to the airport and I

134
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,160
checked my two blue Samsonite suitcases

135
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,139
filled with Colombian weed right at the

136
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
counter

137
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,340
in those days there were no x-ray

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,139
machines or sniffing dogs and I picked

139
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,819
up the suitcases from the turnstile at

140
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,460
LAX

141
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,560
Molly was waiting with the Volvo and we

142
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,339
drove back to Laurel Canyon mission

143
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,339
accomplished

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,459
that was the beginning of my partnership

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,259
with Molly which turned into my first

146
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,319
marriage and at the time of this writing

147
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:07,740
our son Eric is 42.

148
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,319
Molly is sadly no longer with this

149
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,000
I sold the 36 pounds and we moved out of

150
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,000
Reubens and rented a house on the corner

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,180
of Mount Olympus Drive and Laurel Canyon

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,279
we had a good thing going

153
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,319
one day soon after moving to the new

154
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,538
house I went down to get an avocado

155
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
sandwich at the source a health food

156
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:27,899
restaurant on the Sunset Strip next to

157
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,060
Carney's

158
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,978
in those days it had a big dirt parking

159
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,839
lot

160
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:36,899
while in the parking lot I noticed two

161
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,418
guys about my age with dreadlocks

162
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:40,859
I asked them if they were Rastafari and

163
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:43,680
from Jamaica

164
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,300
the answer was yes on both accounts and

165
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,100
I immediately invited them back to my

166
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,840
house to smoke a spleet

167
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,400
back at the house we introduced

168
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,099
ourselves rolled a few with the

169
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,959
Colombian from Rick and smoked them

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,960
these two young Jamaicans were Stephen

171
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,839
katkori and Richard Daly guitarist and

172
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,359
bass player of the band Third World

173
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,478
the band is still touring today and in

174
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,240
2019 released more work to be done their

175
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,180
21st studio album which is nominated for

176
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,519
a Grammy and produced by Damian Marley

177
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,439
I didn't know they were musicians

178
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,180
and after smoking they asked me if I

179
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,000
wanted to come down to Island records on

180
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,740
Sunset at Genesee a few blocks away and

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,439
listen to their new album which was

182
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,060
their first

183
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:29,098
Island Records was in a tudor-style

184
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,459
two-story house with a brick foundation

185
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:34,978
and a red tile roof with brown trim

186
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,079
we went in and there were records lining

187
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:38,038
the wall in a hall which led to a living

188
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,978
room

189
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,959
we walked in and sat down and Cat pulled

190
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:45,120
a green album from somewhere titled

191
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,978
third world

192
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,259
I was blown away to have met some cool

193
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:53,038
guys from Jamaica and they turned out to

194
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,038
have a reggae band wow

195
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,459
kept at the record on the turntable

196
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,739
right there in the comfortable living

197
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:00,839
room of Island records and we listened

198
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,860
to third world's first self-titled album

199
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,859
The Green album

200
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,638
some of the songs on that album are

201
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,620
brand new beggar cere masagana and

202
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,418
slavery days

203
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,579
it blew my mind in a way I wasn't

204
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,680
expecting

205
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,698
right afterwards I went to tower on my

206
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,699
way home and bought the album

207
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,359
it quickly became a hit with all my

208
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,038
friends and Associates and I could

209
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,960
hardly go anywhere where there wasn't a

210
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,000
copy of that album front and center of

211
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,318
everyone's record stack or on the

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,240
turntable

213
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,099
the next year cat and Richie called me

214
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,799
when they got to town and I went to see

215
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,360
third world perform at the Starwood it

216
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,278
was a local Club down at Crescent

217
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,379
Heights in Santa Monica Boulevard

218
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,600
I remember being impressed with the band

219
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,700
and as a keyboard player was really

220
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,860
fascinated with Michael ebo Cooper's

221
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,320
reggae style keyboards

222
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,360
he was the first reggae keyboard player

223
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,820
I had ever seen

224
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,120
by this time the original lead singer on

225
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,879
their first album Milton trilli Hamilton

226
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,860
had been replaced by William bunnyruggs

227
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,539
Clark

228
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,759
the day after the show I helped Richie

229
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,980
buy a miniature TV from sami's camera in

230
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,899
Westwood and later that evening the band

231
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,639
came over to my apartment

232
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:20,600
said it was 96 degrees

233
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,600
in the shed

234
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:25,199
Molly and I had moved from the house on

235
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,480
Laurel Canyon after a slightly

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,980
unfortunate run in with the cops and

237
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,759
were living in an apartment up on

238
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,100
roscomare Road in Bel Air

239
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:38,338
now a little background to this story

240
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,100
by 77 most of the Colombian herb flow

241
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,600
was shut down by the U.S Coast Guard off

242
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,839
the coast of Florida

243
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,940
which spawned a cocaine epidemic and the

244
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,920
first California seedless was making its

245
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,720
appearance at four times the price of

246
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,939
seeded Colombian

247
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,860
I had a couple of ounces

248
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,500
the buds were beautifully multi-colored

249
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,539
green gold and red and they had a citrus

250
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,100
floral fragrance and taste they were

251
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:03,958
Stoney too

252
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,300
times were spare compared to the

253
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,278
Colombian days I was selling smaller

254
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,559
amounts and making less

255
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,299
there I was with a few ounces and the

256
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,059
band comes in and everyone introduces

257
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:16,859
themselves bunny rugs the lead singer

258
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,199
asked if he could roll one

259
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,720
I handed him the bag and before I knew

260
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,180
it he had rolled a half ounce Spleef and

261
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,459
was lighting it I bit my tongue and we

262
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:30,539
smoked that hundred dollars belief in

263
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,539
today's dollars that would be 489.76

264
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,959
however the price of cannabis today is

265
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:39,240
so different the analogy is flawed

266
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,039
but today I am still honored with the

267
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,419
invaluable memory of smoking with bunny

268
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,240
rugs

269
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:48,479
years later in 2014 I sat with bunny

270
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,919
Ricci and cat in a motel in Burbank when

271
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,240
they came to play Reggae night at the

272
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,338
Hollywood Bowl

273
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,079
we reminisced and laughed about that

274
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,060
Spleef

275
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,979
a few months later I went to see third

276
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,919
world play in Agoura Hills

277
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,259
they had a new singer AJ Brown

278
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,899
while the show was playing Heather third

279
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,220
world's manager told me bunny rugs had

280
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,259
died

281
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,420
that was a shock

282
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:15,720
when I saw him before the bull show he

283
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:20,059
was very sick unbeknownst to me

284
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,060
R.I.P William bunny rugs Clark

285
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,458
when I get to heaven we'll smoke a giant

286
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,760
Spleef

287
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:28,759
is today I stand to the victim

288
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,680
after our deal in Miami Rick Hershman

289
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,420
moved up into an apartment building down

290
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,519
the street from our apartment on

291
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,919
roscomare and lived there a few months

292
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,940
he was having hard times with a heroin

293
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,639
problem

294
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,040
as many people were back then

295
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,659
since then I lost touch with him and

296
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,778
haven't been able to track one word of

297
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:59,819
his whereabouts or existence there's not

298
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:00,778
one photo I can find of him anywhere

299
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,700
online

300
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:03,899
and I have a hunch he is not with us

301
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,259
anymore

302
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:09,120
R.I.P Rick if that's the case

303
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,879
I would like to know for certain however

304
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,578
if anyone listening knows about Rick's

305
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,578
existence or demise please contact me

306
