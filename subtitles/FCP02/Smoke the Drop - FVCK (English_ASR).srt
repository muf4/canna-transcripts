[Music]

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,960
yo what's up fcg fan it's PS of the

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,199
future and OG is my oxygen we're doing

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,839
our second iteration of smoke the drop

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:17,079
and this time we're super excited to

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,519
bring you [ __ ] or [ __ ] that's fire I

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:20,919
think before we get into this episode

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,800
we'll you know give a little bit of

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,840
Reflections on the last one I think we

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,519
were super stoked on everyone's feedback

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,079
uh particularly candido watched it and

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,559
they gave some feedback on how they want

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,439
to see their product treat it and I

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,000
imagine we can extend that to everyone

15
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,640
in the future absolutely we'll

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,079
definitely be more gentle with lighting

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,840
the joints this time even though that's

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,878
not always how we spark up our dupes um

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,079
I think we also are just making sure

20
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,198
that we let the Cherry cool and I don't

21
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,759
know I think other than that we're kind

22
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:50,238
of on to a good format and we're you

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,198
know stoked to to get into the [ __ ] [ __ ]

24
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,159
absolutely yeah it was super fun doing

25
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,039
that video last week uh this week like

26
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,558
pack said we've got the [ __ ] or the [ __ ]

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,679
that's fire this is some very coveted

28
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:02,439
stuff

29
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,760
um there's not a ton of it to go around

30
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:07,280
and we were lucky enough thanks to PS to

31
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,359
get our hands on some and so today we're

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,879
going to go through it all and uh rather

33
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,400
these three flavors that we have and

34
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,280
we'll smoke the drop for you 100% And I

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,478
think you know I'm only enough lucky

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,519
enough to get it because I'm a part of

37
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,519
such a cool community so thanks all of

38
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:22,359
you out there uh for making it so that

39
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,519
we just kep the opportunity to spent the

40
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,478
headiest weed around totally is locally

41
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,158
grown in Los Angeles I think in the uh

42
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,759
San Fernando Valley they're organic I

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
don't know much beyond that I think like

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,118
you said it's a pretty small operation

45
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:40,118
can't imagine it's more than with 20 or

46
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,680
so lights they only drop seemingly a

47
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:44,920
handful of times a year so I don't think

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,159
it's a Perpetual Harvest by any means

49
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,439
and their last drop which was around

50
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,960
December of last year if I'm not

51
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,000
mistaken December of last year January

52
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:55,919
this year was really one of the most

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,680
hyped moments in recent memory we with

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
the last drop had the opportunity to

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
smoke the cream smoothie which was their

56
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,599
entrance into the proper doinks bracket

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,200
they got second place with that which

58
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,959
was super cool uh they also did a guava

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,239
Frost from noron Nemo S1 which we

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,080
thought was really

61
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,200
delicious and there was another one too

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
that I'm forgetting that we smoked I

63
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,679
can't remember off the top of my head

64
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,800
what it was either yeah there was the

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,000
cream smoothie there was the guava Frost

66
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,360
oh and then there was of course the one

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,759
that I reviewed that was really good I

68
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,200
don't remember exactly what it was it

69
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,280
was a lemon noji crossed gushers very

70
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,280
similar to the super sour Berry that

71
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,800
comes out of the bay that people really

72
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,919
like that was I think my favorite

73
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,200
actually of the last drop this drop uh

74
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,679
there were the three flavors in front of

75
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,359
us that we're going to get into as well

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,599
as sour dub and the cream smoothie again

77
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,599
I personally didn't love the cream

78
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,280
smoothie gelonade is just not one of my

79
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,199
favorite perss generally and the sour

80
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,560
dub wasn't actually made available to me

81
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,000
so my thinking is we're going to start

82
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,318
with the blue ivory the candy Thai

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,400
cultivar then go into the Citrus

84
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,878
hopefully get a little bit of an energy

85
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,319
boost and then end with the OG and that

86
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,399
point will be totally unqualified to

87
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,238
talk about

88
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,519
anything absolutely but yeah let's get

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
this thing sparked man I'm stoked to

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,439
taste

91
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,518
it so right now we're going to pass this

92
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,878
jar back and forth and get a sense of

93
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,719
the aroma so there's a little bit of

94
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:22,518
like a spicy peppery Funk but other than

95
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:25,039
that it's really a pure candy I think

96
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,439
that under circumstances where I wasn't

97
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,639
being particularly critical if you told

98
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,680
me this was a Lemon Cherry or runs I'd

99
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:35,238
100% believe you yeah it has that true

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,640
Cherry candy almost Cherry Garcia type

101
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:41,519
sweetness so I pretty much agree with

102
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,559
everything that Pat just said especially

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,120
I mean the Cherry Garcia note is spot

104
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,959
on I think that I think that part of

105
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,438
this uh part of this flavor profile and

106
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,799
Aroma profile definitely uh involves a

107
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,078
little more Funk but on the top end

108
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:04,040
you're getting a lot of candy and really

109
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,040
like pack said you

110
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,200
know could exist within the same realm

111
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,120
as the runs or Lemon Cherry type candies

112
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,919
yeah there's a little bit of a hazelnut

113
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,399
sweetness that I associate with the

114
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,120
gelato it's a good representation of its

115
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,279
pedigree 100% absolutely I think that

116
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,800
this is the sort of thing that is just a

117
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,559
slightly different shade of something

118
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,639
that's very ubiquitous but there are a

119
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,720
lot of people who only smoke candy and

120
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,160
finding that next new great candy that's

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,280
a slightly different

122
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,080
yeah is absolutely a worthwhile Pursuit

123
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,879
and I think that this is a great

124
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,959
representation of

125
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,839
that it's going to be dope so blue ivory

126
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:48,120
is a collaboration between Umami

127
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,079
genetics and Watson suppo with their

128
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,959
cold heat their cold heat which is like

129
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,918
a runs cookman thing is super popular

130
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,879
and the Umami genetics to similar work

131
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:00,000
with a lot of the gelados finding

132
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,959
recessive traits um yeah it's generally

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,199
a very candy for forward cultivar we

134
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,918
could go into the whole pedigree but

135
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,280
it's a lot of gelato and Sh back on each

136
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,560
other I think the one thing that's worth

137
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,439
noting is they include a strain called

138
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,839
Seattle soda pretty deep back in their

139
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,199
pedigree and that's pretty consistent

140
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,879
across all of their lines I've never had

141
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,600
a chance to to try it but I like when

142
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,360
people have a sort of off-kilter staple

143
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
that gives their genetic lines a

144
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,960
slightly different shade especially when

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,160
everyone's

146
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,599
using the same building blocks

147
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,360
extensively having something a little

148
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,960
bit different

149
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,639
can be a welcome repri

150
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,318
absolutely what are you getting on the

151
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:42,560
dry pole it's definitely sort of minty

152
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:45,039
there's a eucalyptus note it's sweet

153
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,759
there's a bit of a pine but it isn't a

154
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,240
foresty pine it's more of a Candi Pine

155
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,639
mhm yeah I get the Eucalyptus in the

156
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,038
pine for

157
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,600
sure yeah I I actually don't really have

158
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,759
a sense base on this rifle how it's

159
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
going to evolve during combustion I'm

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,280
I'm looking forward to trying it yeah me

161
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,000
too to man what were your thoughts as

162
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,879
you broke it down and Woll it

163
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,399
up so these actually were pretty good on

164
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,918
the uh extra biomass I you know was

165
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,918
careful as I always am to remove the

166
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,639
stems and the water leaves and sugar

167
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:21,598
leaves to get the best smoking material

168
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,000
we can for our dink but um I mean just

169
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:25,519
uh compared to last week's review

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,598
there's a lot less extra biomass um

171
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,079
doesn't have anything to do with the

172
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:30,319
quality of the flow the quality of the

173
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,879
smoke um I just noticed there was a lot

174
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,080
less that extra biomass on this

175
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,598
breakdown and I also while being careful

176
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,478
on each strin got that same experience

177
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:42,038
across the other two flavors as well

178
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,159
interesting and I

179
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,318
think well from

180
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,759
candido it seems like the jars we got

181
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,560
were mostly all tops this seems like

182
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,038
more of an even mix which isn't

183
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,038
necessarily a bad thing I think that a

184
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,120
complaint that I did see levered against

185
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,038
[ __ ] is that they're Smalls in the jar

186
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,759
and at really one of the most dear price

187
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,318
points of any in the market I think the

188
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,360
least anyone is paying is8 and people

189
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,680
are paying upwards of a th000 an

190
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,240
ounce you typically don't expect to see

191
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,639
small or expect excuse me to see

192
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,560
Smalls uh but that doesn't really change

193
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,560
the quality and you have firstand

194
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,000
experience when you're growing in soil

195
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,879
and particularly a new soil you're not

196
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
always going to get those amazing tops

197
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,680
yeah ex so what are your thoughts on the

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,199
nug size and bag ofel uh bag appeel is

199
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,160
nice the scent is out of this world and

200
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,598
the weed is sticky on all of them

201
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,759
however I I did note that there was uh

202
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:39,240
you know a healthy mixture of Smalls and

203
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,759
you know more medium normal siiz nugs um

204
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,038
like P said you know that doesn't

205
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,400
reflect the quality at all um it

206
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:49,240
certainly can be a reflection of you

207
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,519
know many things one thing being trying

208
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,879
out new soil or trying out a new Garden

209
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,519
technique can be another reflection of

210
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,759
you know um it's the the grower may feel

211
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,758
like it's still smokable and it is

212
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,439
smokable um but at that price point the

213
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,800
consumer has a certain expectation that

214
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:12,120
um you know they want it to live up to

215
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,520
and you know nothing negative to say

216
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,720
about it uh we just noticed that there's

217
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:21,639
a decent you know mix of nug size in

218
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,000
there very cool I I completely agree we

219
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,840
are both pretty accustomed to smoking

220
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,478
Smalls The Growers that we work with

221
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,158
tend to slide us small as more than real

222
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,519
jars and so I think that we can almost

223
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:33,158
object i l say that it doesn't impact

224
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,759
the smoking experience unless it's real

225
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,120
sort of popcorn trunk Funk grass yeah

226
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,519
that's different the lar is very

227
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,519
different than the smalls um Smalls can

228
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,799
be small buds Smalls can be pieces that

229
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,360
were knocked off of the larger nugs from

230
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,919
trimming there's a whole number of

231
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,399
things um but as long as it's not you

232
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:54,399
know frizzy crap from the bottom of the

233
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:58,159
trunk popcorn nugs then you're good to

234
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,440
go I completely agree off rip this gives

235
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,439
me a strong

236
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,078
I don't know it's it's very similar to

237
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,240
Georgia pie it has that kind of sweet

238
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,919
wheat grassy tone that you'd expect with

239
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,799
runs it also has that baked good almost

240
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:19,360
Meed effect dough sort of thing that you

241
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,359
get from cush Ms that can be really

242
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,799
Pleasant it's very creamy it isn't

243
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:31,359
overwhelmingly

244
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,359
flavorful but it's good and it's super

245
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,839
yeah I'm definitely getting the creamy

246
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,799
notes kind of the back end has a little

247
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,040
bit of that Georgia pie

248
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,359
Funk um I guess I would say this is not

249
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,039
as candy for it as we expected not to

250
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,919
say it's not smoking super nice um I

251
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,679
don't think we're going to be able to

252
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,679
show the camera necessarily but it's

253
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:04,120
smoking clean uh there's you know good

254
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:08,278
combustion nice resin ring uh

255
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,278
overall overall a fine smoking

256
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,399
experience but the flavor

257
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,159
is the flavor is leading a lot more

258
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,278
towards those more mellow notes rather

259
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:24,838
than anything brighter to me

260
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:27,439
um there's a little bit of leathery Funk

261
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,000
to it almost

262
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,680
um yeah I'm getting I'm getting a little

263
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
bit of that eucalyptus note that we got

264
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,039
on the dry pole as well I'm excited to

265
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,039
check it out

266
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,278
again yeah definitely like a fuller

267
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:49,838
bodied smoke than I expected just from

268
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:52,679
uh the cross and the smell um overall

269
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,320
not bad not bad at all it kind of at

270
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,679
this one is reminding me of one of the

271
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,760
white Mentos sugary little bits of

272
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,559
artificial vanilla and and then a

273
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,159
meaningful cooling effect on the back

274
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:08,159
end totally it's it's tasty for

275
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,159
sure

276
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,359
absolutely I think that as I smoke it

277
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,958
more it does start to resemble the

278
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,278
general candy gas type of lcg Ron

279
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,879
cultivars that are out there in the

280
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:27,200
market it isn't that far off though it's

281
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:29,559
a very clean and beautifully grown

282
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,278
expression it has a bit of a Cher that

283
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm picking up on now kind of like a a

284
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,439
cherry cough drop in the best way

285
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,639
possible cool very cool that certainly

286
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,959
you know that certainly plays well with

287
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,320
the the eucalyptus

288
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,039
notes and then it's also taking on this

289
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,079
kind of almost Maple syrupy

290
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,519
sweetness as it burns down are you

291
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:53,559
getting that sort oftion in the sugary

292
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:57,278
yeah the the last the hit I just

293
00:11:53,559 --> 00:12:00,638
took had a forward sugary on the tongue

294
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,559
kind of maple syrupy note

295
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,200
you get that on the back end as well

296
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,199
halfway through the

297
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,759
joint yeah I feel like uh I feel like

298
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,360
the sweeter notes are starting to come

299
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,759
out now that we've smoked you know a

300
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,079
decent amount into

301
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,159
this and I think we keep using the word

302
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,519
subtle but it is very flavorful it is

303
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,278
pallet standing there are certain times

304
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:34,000
are subtles ISM for nothing going on but

305
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,919
in this case it really is just they sort

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,159
of softer candy notes it isn't as

307
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,399
aggressively Citrus forward it isn't as

308
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,919
aggressively gassy it's mellow but it

309
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,600
isn't

310
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,479
unflavored yeah definitely has flavor

311
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,199
definitely has flavor he lost the ash

312
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,159
there which sometimes changes

313
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:55,159
temperature I wonder how this set going

314
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,639
to be different because of that yeah

315
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:01,439
that's good to know I mean we me and P

316
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,120
we really like to pay attention to all

317
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,959
the nuances that affect the smoking

318
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,759
experience um you know that's why that's

319
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:11,078
why we found it important also to take

320
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:14,039
some feedback from uh the viewers and

321
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:16,638
the farmers and stuff as well and how we

322
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:19,198
uh how we modulate our consumption

323
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,959
experience and a lot of people prefer

324
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,479
including us to leave the ashon to

325
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,759
insulate the cherry and make your hit

326
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,720
cooler uh therefore protecting some of

327
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,879
the more volatile flavor compounds

328
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,240
I couldn't agree more I think that it

329
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,240
did get a little bit more

330
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,199
herbaceous it almost has like a smoked

331
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,120
Sor quality in the background that's

332
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,679
cool I don't know if it's as desirable

333
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,159
as the the really nuan candy almost

334
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,159
contractionary type stuff they we were

335
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,719
getting earlier but there's nothing

336
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,078
wrong with that yeah totally yeah I

337
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,560
think people would be uh people would be

338
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,719
pleased to smoke this and I think people

339
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,599
have been I think the people generally

340
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,000
have been it is the case that people are

341
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,879
really stoked I think that [ __ ] went

342
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,639
into this most recent drop with a really

343
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,679
strong

344
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,240
reputation and came out of it with

345
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,120
everything intact which is almost all

346
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,278
you could ask for as a brand that is

347
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,679
commanded a top of the market price

348
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,480
point where people become so so critical

349
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:22,198
absolutely when consumers are paying the

350
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,519
top-of the market prices the room for

351
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:27,719
error is a lot lot Slimmer and people

352
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,879
pay attention really closely to every

353
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,759
detail um that being said I think like

354
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,480
pack said [ __ ] came out of this drop

355
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,000
with the reputation intact which is

356
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,440
great um I mean literally what you said

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,919
that's all you can ask for when you're

358
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,440
commanding a price like that as well as

359
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,719
um being a new brand and they have

360
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,600
really only been around for a year maybe

361
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,278
a little bit more and i' they've grown

362
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,360
in a meaningful way every time they've

363
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:58,439
dropped which is cool absolutely it's

364
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,560
it's great to see Brands be able to

365
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,759
expand their reach will maintain quality

366
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,000
often times you don't get to see those

367
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,519
two things go hand in hand

368
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,958
totally in terms of effects and it's

369
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,560
going to be easiest to talk about this

370
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,039
one cuz it's our first smoke of this

371
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:18,479
sesh it's definitely Stony uh stonier

372
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:20,360
than most candies I feel it yeah has

373
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,920
like a real heaviness almost like

374
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,320
fuzziness behind my eyes yeah big time

375
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,479
this is definitely definitely a stony

376
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,480
one definitely gives you the behind the

377
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,480
eyes effect um um at this point I've

378
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,360
already had to redo certain parts of

379
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,680
this take just off half this joint so

380
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,159
the power is there um [ __ ] [ __ ] has got

381
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:44,000
the power for sure it's smoking it

382
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,958
definitely does I think that just

383
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,720
because it's not a Turf that's

384
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,958
particularly unique this isn't one that

385
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,480
I'd return to at the price point but I'm

386
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,799
also not mad at it I think that

387
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,278
particularly based on and I'm forgetting

388
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,879
what it's called but that Legend OG the

389
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,519
gush from the last round I was willing

390
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:07,439
to return to [ __ ] and I was willing to

391
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,839
pick up a whole ounce this time uh we

392
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,440
already blew through seven of the Kimber

393
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,800
absolutely which was really really good

394
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,279
I think that if this one were to come

395
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,719
back around I wouldn't grab it but also

396
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,120
if some were to tell me that their

397
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,519
favorite type of smoke is candy this is

398
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,839
the one that I point them to absolutely

399
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,839
yeah my sentiment pretty much just

400
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,000
Echoes everything that pack just

401
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,120
said hell yeah all right well I feel

402
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,759
like we should take a second cool down

403
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,600
cuz this is some super super strong [ __ ]

404
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,278
and then we'll get into the lemons let's

405
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,920
do it guys sweet so I think we're both

406
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,720
sufficiently baked yeah totally the blue

407
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,559
strong which is awesome I I think

408
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,879
especially at this price point if it

409
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,879
can't offer that uh what are you doing

410
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,078
yeah totally but yeah that was rad and

411
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,958
that was the kind of joint that could

412
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,359
get you through an afternoon which I

413
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,359
think is a requirement when you're at

414
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,318
the top of the market 100% totally which

415
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,919
almost makes me scared to go through and

416
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:08,159
smoke sort of deemed to be a progression

417
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:11,600
of strength um this is the rainbow

418
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,919
lemons which is gelonade cross to

419
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,599
Rainbow belts I actually think it's the

420
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,079
other way around um or maybe not I don't

421
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,159
know which one it is which one was one

422
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:22,399
of those um but those are you know just

423
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,319
again really really strong genetics I

424
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,199
think that the rainbow belts and the

425
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,480
gelonade have lemonade and Z with them

426
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,080
to complement the gelato tones that we

427
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,038
got from the blue ivory and so this is

428
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,519
going to have more of a citrus

429
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:38,319
underpinning um smoked some rainbow

430
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,519
belts last time and we talked about how

431
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,798
especially in the dry pole there were

432
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,200
lemony tones there was less Citrus in

433
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:48,599
the actual smoke that we expected but

434
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:51,160
this should be lemon lime Tren lion name

435
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,678
strong yeah this is the kind of thing

436
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,320
that definitely can wake you up when

437
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,120
you're uh very Stony uh it can also get

438
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,599
you even more high in a different way

439
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:03,599
and then you're just both both so we'll

440
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,279
see which way it goes for us it almost

441
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,519
has like a

442
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:11,558
Mojito quality on the inhale it mint and

443
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,759
lime oh yeah big time mint and lime in

444
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,639
the Forefront really enjoy it though I'm

445
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,200
excited to smoke it also sufficiently

446
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,600
confident that it's going to get us

447
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,880
destroyed yeah totally you want to light

448
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:25,798
it up yeah oh no let's take a let's do

449
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,799
the aroma first let's do the

450
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:33,839
aroma it smells smells like

451
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:36,119
Z it smells like if someone had like

452
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:39,279
emptied some Lysol onto a jar of

453
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:42,158
Skittles it does have that astringent

454
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,839
lemon lime cleaner yeah really hardcore

455
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,600
lemon lime cleaner like but then there

456
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:51,639
is that Skittles

457
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:53,918
grapefruit s yeah but yeah my my my nose

458
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,960
immediately gets the lemon lime cleaner

459
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,480
and then as you finish your inhale or

460
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,600
start to process more of the things

461
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,599
hting those receptors in your

462
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:06,759
nose there's more sweetness grapefruit Z

463
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:09,359
it's a it's an interesting delicious

464
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,079
smelling dry so I'm on the record is not

465
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,279
really liking lemon yeah I know that you

466
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,399
disagree so I think you're going to be

467
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,960
the better qualified to to analyze this

468
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,038
totally so why don't you spark it up and

469
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,640
I'll uh let's do it I'll smoke along and

470
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,640
try to try to enjoy the

471
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,320
ride yeah let's see I think the reason I

472
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,480
don't like lemon is that those chps can

473
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,240
be kind of racy and anxiety and doent

474
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,360
yeah uh I totally age it is not so much

475
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,240
the experience with the palette and more

476
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,798
the effects and I think that that's also

477
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,880
part of why I wanted to put it after the

478
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,798
candy because I do think based on just

479
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,679
historical experience uh if it is prone

480
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:50,279
to induce that it certainly will even

481
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:54,000
later in a rotation totally um and I

482
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,918
agree with you on that but happen to

483
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,640
have just historically really enjoyed

484
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:03,080
the flavor experience and uh you know

485
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,960
sometimes suffered through the more racy

486
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:07,759
head change that you can get all of the

487
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,279
Growers who are growing amazing lemon

488
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,440
turps and

489
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,960
really you know considered the best of

490
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,480
the best in a lot of ways uh the lemon

491
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,400
Bean that a bunch of people grow

492
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,798
that's offered by like halia which is

493
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,759
Eddie Le OG cross the lemon tree people

494
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,000
love trying to think of what else

495
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,079
obviously the lemon up by Mr kushington

496
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,519
uh bread by SE junky I think that's TK

497
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,038
on lemonade yeah totally that's always

498
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,200
Making Waves I was in a room earlier

499
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,679
this week where people were talking

500
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,759
about their favorite weed of all time

501
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,280
was the connected gelonade when it first

502
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,879
dropped which was not my thing yeah but

503
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,279
I do think that lemon turps for those

504
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,360
who love it really love you know I think

505
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,720
with lemon turps those who love it they

506
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:54,719
really love it yeah absolutely I mean

507
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:58,279
it's a it's also it's it's not easy

508
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:02,360
necessarily to grow fire lemon weed but

509
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:04,678
it's certainly a pallet staining profile

510
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,119
it'll get all up in your sinuses it'll

511
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,480
make you know everything taste and smell

512
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,519
like lemons at least you know after

513
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,919
you're hit

514
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,079
um that being said it's not it's not a

515
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:22,159
cheat code to good weed but

516
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:25,119
um it's just a it's kind of a cheat code

517
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,720
to a pallet stainer it is a cheat to a

518
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,959
palet stainer I think that is super true

519
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,038
you said something that I'd love you to

520
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,240
Circle back to that it's not super easy

521
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,919
to grow lemon flavors is there a

522
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,480
particular reason why no it's just not

523
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,200
not easy to grow good weed in general

524
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,200
you know that's

525
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,919
true it's

526
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,960
uh you know everybody's got their own

527
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,360
subjective experience about what good is

528
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,640
but you know to us just like without

529
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,038
getting too deep into it uh we like

530
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,640
things that are flavored forward with

531
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,759
nice you know enjoyable euphoric

532
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,880
experiences it's really kind of

533
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:09,158
encapsulates it that's 100% TR yeah

534
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,039
totally cuz we can make a whole video on

535
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,799
what makes weed good or not good to us

536
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:17,319
but we want to focus on this weed we do

537
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:19,918
this is I mean just off the rip and that

538
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,240
first jar I think super good weed well

539
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,159
what's your impression of this before I

540
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,679
go in um I'm getting nice you know nice

541
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,840
turs from the first hits I always feel

542
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,159
like uh I have to wait until the second

543
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,480
hit to get my first impression of what

544
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,799
it tastes like just because you know the

545
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,798
way we light our joints with a torch

546
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,038
lighter you end up combusting quite a

547
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,759
bit to get an even Cherry at the front

548
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:46,000
yeah guys I feel like uh I get all the

549
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,960
flavor after the first hit and the light

550
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,720
up that's where I really start to judge

551
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,600
what I'm consuming this is tasty I think

552
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,960
it's you know it's tough because the

553
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,879
lemon strains that I'm comparing it to

554
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,440
are like we mentioned earlier considered

555
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,960
some of the best strains in the world

556
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,278
and the lemon strains that are very

557
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,640
popular right now even though I don't

558
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:09,679
love them are incredibly lemon forward

559
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,120
totally uh the Mr kushington Lemon up

560
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,000
almost tastes like you're sucking on a

561
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:17,798
lemon head yeah this is more subtle it's

562
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,480
more lemong grassy I'd say very

563
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:24,079
lemongrass it's it's more zest less

564
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,880
candy lemon like you get some tang in

565
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,960
your mouth after the exhale um I would

566
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,000
definitely say lemongrass forward and

567
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,278
like lime zest too I think that You'

568
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,119
using that word immediately spared a ton

569
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,880
of sense memories I enjoyed that for a

570
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,399
minute you cank you can blow it um I

571
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,000
really thought it was very good though

572
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,159
but yeah like I was saying like lime us

573
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,839
there's that moment and there's that

574
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:52,120
little bit of green in the Lim smell

575
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,000
that you get in this it's similarly

576
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:55,959
herbaceous which is not really something

577
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,278
I expected in either of these cultivars

578
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,798
totally but I'm really enjoying I also

579
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,720
think that from an effects perspective

580
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,720
normally after having smoked as much as

581
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,720
I did uh just now of a lemon strand if

582
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,519
it was going to be anxiety inducing it

583
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,600
would have happened already and to keep

584
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,519
it a buck with everyone between takes

585
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,158
something a little bit scary

586
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,038
happen but we're all good and I think

587
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,159
that I I do feel really good and that's

588
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:22,960
also a testament to strong soil grown

589
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,880
flow I think that we don't really have a

590
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,759
strong reason why it could be

591
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,080
psychosomatic but generally clean flow

592
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,759
as sort of the top priority but then one

593
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:38,319
under that being medium and soil tend to

594
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:41,158
generate the most euphoric and sort of

595
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,599
peaceful absolutely yeah this is this is

596
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:47,640
a lot more euphoric than I expected and

597
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:50,719
I definitely um I feel more leveled out

598
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:55,360
than after we smoked just the blue ivory

599
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:58,720
this one definitely has uh it has my my

600
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,158
favorite effect of the two so far

601
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,399
yeah it's

602
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:07,000
almost calming and cooling totally which

603
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:09,119
is really enjoyable on an August de yeah

604
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,119
absolutely we're in a glass studio with

605
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,239
no AC um AC coming soon what do you guys

606
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,759
think of

607
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:22,038
that get ready yep get ready we're going

608
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,879
to be a lot more lively oh yeah um no

609
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:26,038
but this is like super refreshing good

610
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,320
Summer Tree yeahuh yeah totally I

611
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:29,960
actually like it I sort of am stoked to

612
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,439
to have this D because my understanding

613
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,399
is that it was the most scarce of the

614
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,000
drop that's cool it's it's a cool TP uh

615
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:40,439
the rainbow belts itself I don't know

616
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,200
the extent that I'm getting much from it

617
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,640
other than just the sort of melness in a

618
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,240
funny way rainbow belt is often

619
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,840
described as diety and there's certain

620
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,759
certainly examples of rainbow belts that

621
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,879
are not diety and very very uh potent

622
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,079
and flavorful in their own right but

623
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,200
this has that creaminess the rainbow

624
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:01,079
belts can have um

625
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,440
paired with sort of the lemon forward

626
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,558
tones from the gelonade that makes this

627
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,759
a really enjoyable smoking

628
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:10,440
experience this one is really nice and

629
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,919
the flavor stays consistent at least

630
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,840
through this point in a way that's

631
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:17,720
really enjoyable totally it's a little

632
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:21,158
bit tickly um I'm finding myself feeling

633
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,519
a little bit of a Sneezy effect yeah um

634
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,919
I think volatile turps will do that yeah

635
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:29,158
oh yeah at this point in the joint for

636
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,960
sure like after that hit I just took

637
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,919
it uh lit up those

638
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,558
receptors which is tough because I feel

639
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,320
like a lot of the best flower does it's

640
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:39,599
hard to hold that against flower though

641
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:41,519
I I certainly enjoy not sneezing in the

642
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,678
middle of a

643
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,679
s totally it has what I would describe

644
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,759
even through sunglasses as like ice

645
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,798
cream conach where it almost looks like

646
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:56,879
it's melting into itself uh that's sort

647
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:58,918
of a superficial thing to Value but it's

648
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,760
something that for whatever and whenever

649
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,960
I see I I do get a little excited yeah I

650
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:08,000
agree it it doesn't make any sense but

651
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,000
it it's cool right I totally

652
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:14,678
agree so I agree with you that this is

653
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:16,720
from an effects perspective my favorite

654
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,759
of the two same I think from a flavor

655
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,200
perspective it's also my favorite of the

656
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:23,158
two and I'm sure that based on the way

657
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,080
that we intro it that's not what folks

658
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:29,120
were expecting yeah

659
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:31,278
100% yeah yeah o it's it's even just the

660
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,439
the ambient smoke is a little tickly

661
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:37,398
yeah totally yeah that

662
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,558
uh I guess it's uh classic case of you

663
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:41,319
know don't judge don't judge a jar by uh

664
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,480
its

665
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:47,639
cover it kind of reminds me of like

666
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,679
a like a lemongrass tea Boba drunk

667
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,640
situation it it's has that cooling

668
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:57,640
effect that I really really

669
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,640
enjoy yeah

670
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,319
yeah I

671
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:07,120
definitely I definitely am enjoying the

672
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:09,240
flavor on this one and the effect um

673
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:12,518
there's something about that kind of

674
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,480
mentholated experience combined with the

675
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:20,440
lighting up of those tpine slf flavor

676
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:24,558
nerve receptors and your sinuses it uh

677
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,558
it definitely has a refreshing

678
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,158
effect and it's getting stronger every

679
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,720
time I hit it as well

680
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,039
I think that while I really felt the

681
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,798
blue ivory more behind my eyes this one

682
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:38,440
I do feel is energizing but not racy way

683
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,720
yeah know it's more like full body

684
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:45,000
Euphoria

685
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,440
100% yeah it definitely is getting me uh

686
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,278
it's going to be pretty high every time

687
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,480
I go in for another rotation on it

688
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,599
noticeably yeah not to use the same

689
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,480
descriptor twice but like this one does

690
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:59,558
have a cough drop quality but not Cherry

691
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:03,240
more like AA yeah yeah totally

692
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:06,798
absolutely with those whatever Alpine

693
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:11,120
spices yeah Alpine herbs and spices with

694
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,119
the Alpine herbs and spices there you

695
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:26,278
go yeah it really it has moved

696
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:30,960
towards for lack of repeating it you

697
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,960
know um Alpine herbs and

698
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,240
spices that's turn it's cool it's really

699
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:41,000
cool to get that from a you know a

700
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:44,200
citrus to Belt type of

701
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,319
cross I wonder if there're even spices

702
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,640
it might just be Alpine herbs Alpine

703
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,599
herbs

704
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,360
exactly so I at this point I actually do

705
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:55,879
you use this language as well I feel

706
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:58,038
kind of leveled off I I st we've smoked

707
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,480
two really really strong really eny

708
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:03,359
enjoyable joints yeah totally but the

709
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,038
effects that were really heavy not

710
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:11,359
sedative but more Stupify from the blue

711
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:13,558
IV have really sort of tabed off and I I

712
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,639
feel much more alive and articulate

713
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:20,079
after the the rainbow lemons yeah same

714
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:24,038
here yeah going back to the uh comment

715
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,199
just on the structure this is the I'm

716
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,919
I'm not sure if you guys are getting a

717
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,519
focused image of this if you aren't it's

718
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:34,799
fine basically this is the uh kind of

719
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:39,278
this is the kind of structure that uh is

720
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:43,240
also a result of a fine grind uh just to

721
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:45,319
return to that thought and um a tight

722
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,759
pack

723
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:53,079
joint and that doesn't mean it's better

724
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:56,480
than the loose joint at all it's just

725
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:58,519
uh how we like to roll our joints and

726
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,960
that differs for everybody

727
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:04,159
totally I think finding what works is

728
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,840
what it's all about absolutely 100% for

729
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,440
me what works is having you Pearl up P

730
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,918
up the fire flow and picker Stampy

731
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,038
choosers so I'm just always stoked to

732
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,799
get to smoke hell

733
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,879
yeah we're enjoying this one for sure

734
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:19,638
100% I'm just looking at that trilly

735
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,559
Kimber no one what's going to do cuz I

736
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:25,719
rat it we smoke of it and thinking that

737
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:28,119
you know like it's 3:20 in the afternoon

738
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,000
on a Sunday and I don't know if that's

739
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,798
exactly what I want to get into right

740
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,278
now we're going to do it for you guys we

741
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,679
are going to do it for you guys but yeah

742
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:39,919
it's a it's some strong weed it's

743
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,000
certainly it's intimidating but you know

744
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,399
we do it for the viewers we do it for

745
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,919
the community uh and we love getting to

746
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,319
smoke good weed so you know it's a good

747
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,759
afternoon even though that [ __ ] is going

748
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,038
to be strong for sure and I also think

749
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,798
we We Do It For The Growers not that

750
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:58,720
we're any good at this but I do think

751
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,798
that people don't take this stuff

752
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,120
seriously enough which is why even

753
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,278
though we're smoking we're having a

754
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:06,678
great time we're dedicating part of our

755
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:09,038
afternoon to trying to really describe

756
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,639
what makes flower Lake [ __ ] so special

757
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:14,759
because the market has moved in a way

758
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:16,519
where especially in regulated markets

759
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:18,759
flour is very accessible it's

760
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,638
overproduced and it's cheap and there's

761
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:26,079
not a lot of good consumer education and

762
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:29,079
so to be able to highlight why a small

763
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,240
independent organic grow that's doing

764
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,879
everything

765
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,038
right this product is meaningfully

766
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,600
better is really exciting

767
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:42,720
MH it is absolutely so I had

768
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,839
to had to hydrate there we keep it keep

769
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,480
it hydrated and lit guys we got it and

770
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:48,000
so like my thinking is eventually people

771
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,639
are going to come into the space and do

772
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,119
incredible journalism and you know

773
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:53,839
hopefully we're just a Tipping Point and

774
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,518
people are going to do it way better

775
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,398
than we could ever imagine but someone

776
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:00,558
should be taking the time

777
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,000
to really go through these things and

778
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:04,398
like especially with the trilly Kimber

779
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,759
that we're about to smoke which it's a

780
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,398
trilly Kimber 2.0 I didn't highlight

781
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:11,919
that in my review I think that it means

782
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:13,398
say I don't know what 2.0 means maybe

783
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,519
someone in the comments can tell us but

784
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:18,079
like it's an OG grown in the San

785
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,720
Fernando Valley not that that's an

786
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,278
appalation of origin because it doesn't

787
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,159
involve the outside but like that's a

788
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:26,599
meaningful historical thing and

789
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,880
especially coming up in La both of us in

790
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:32,719
the you know late 2000s early 2010s like

791
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,080
that was the best flower that was around

792
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,919
that was the special local thing and I

793
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,599
do think in a lot of ways this is one of

794
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,480
the most special representations of it

795
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,798
that exists today and so getting to

796
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,240
highlight it even though it's going to

797
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:45,918
make me want to go to

798
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,319
sleep is going to be super cool

799
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,960
absolutely yeah I've always uh I've

800
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:54,599
always been one to chase the flavors

801
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,840
that are found in OG Kush fenos and um

802
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,439
you know back in the day like P said

803
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,918
that was the best of the best weed out

804
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,519
there and you know I've uh I've always

805
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,919
found myself uh drawn to them and I've

806
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,239
always been uh appreciative of their

807
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,200
effects and

808
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,078
flavor yeah and so like between taking

809
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,918
dry hits I guess can you just talk more

810
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:19,039
about your relation with those

811
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:22,358
T yeah man that's like honestly for me

812
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:25,320
that is the weed that my first like kind

813
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:30,639
of cannabis Mentor when I was very young

814
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,119
uh got me into and and basically he uh

815
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,720
it's a guy that I worked with doing

816
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:40,919
Media stuff um I'm going cut this out

817
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:42,480
but sus boy I know yeah so anyways so

818
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:44,440
basically when I was younger I was doing

819
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,280
really cool media internships and I

820
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,800
happened to work with a

821
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,720
guy oh this tastes tastes awesome in the

822
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,359
dry pole I happened to work with a guy

823
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:58,279
who had grown uh previously to the media

824
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:59,799
stuff we were doing and he was funny

825
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,160
enough friends with a bunch of Growers

826
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,599
and would just go and pick up a ton of

827
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:08,559
OG Kush and so when I was uh you know

828
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:11,200
getting into smoking around that age uh

829
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:13,078
I basically was exposed to real

830
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:16,960
connoisseur cannabis through the lens of

831
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:19,200
OG kushes and then I just really really

832
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,240
hyperfocused on you know getting to try

833
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,799
them all and as much as I could

834
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:25,279
experience as the years went on and

835
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,800
certain Cuts were around and not around

836
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,839
and then I ended up um getting back into

837
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,320
into like growing stuff like a little

838
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:35,838
kind of more than a hobby doing it more

839
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,359
full-time and my mentor in that space

840
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,719
Also happen to be really into OG kushes

841
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:42,319
and so he was able to help further fuel

842
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:44,879
my interest in it and show me some stuff

843
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,039
I hadn't tried and uh yeah I just

844
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,680
[ __ ] love OG Kush dude 100% and not

845
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:52,199
to sort of talk too much about kush

846
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:55,799
before we get into [ __ ] rendition of

847
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:57,358
OG Kush but like my a lot of my early

848
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,160
smoking memories were jars that you'd

849
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:00,519
bring around and I didn't have to care

850
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:02,519
cuz you were always bringing around the

851
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:04,759
fire which was

852
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:07,000
legendary and I only really started

853
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,240
caring once wreck Market stuff started

854
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,239
happening and it's like where did the

855
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,439
fire go but I'm pretty sure you were

856
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,799
bringing around legendary stuff I just

857
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,079
didn't know it at the time like the

858
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,039
Wi-Fi from Rascal the Paris OG the mega

859
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:20,480
Wellness can you you know talk about

860
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,318
some of the ones that were particularly

861
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,838
formative oh totally I mean you just

862
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:28,119
named a couple of my favorite from like

863
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:30,519
kind of the uh I guess we would say

864
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:32,400
uh contemporary OG kushes because there

865
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,679
was you know there's the old school ones

866
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,318
and then there's the ones that came

867
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:39,199
along as more and more people got access

868
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:42,800
to the genetics um mega Wellness I loved

869
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,879
um I believe that's like a Skywalker cut

870
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,839
um I don't know the exact lore on it but

871
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,760
that's what I've heard and uh since I've

872
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:53,440
tried it and you know really enjoyed it

873
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,839
uh in circulations of people I know also

874
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,920
been able to try ones that were like

875
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:00,599
supposedly the same cut and they've been

876
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,920
super good as well as

877
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:07,039
um gosh what else uh the Wi-Fi was cool

878
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,000
because I ended up uh being in proximity

879
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:13,119
to OG Rascal uh just through like glass

880
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,280
stuff and so I was able to you know try

881
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,318
out his Wi-Fi and get some to share and

882
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,760
that was super bomb um and I also

883
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:24,000
through glass and glass collecting and

884
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,119
interest and glass blowing happened to

885
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
be in proximity to the Paris OG people

886
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,559
um and I actually don't know what the

887
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,480
exact genetics off the top of my head

888
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,078
were on that what kind of cut it was or

889
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,280
if it was related to something like that

890
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:39,800
but those guys were really really cool

891
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,800
and uh happy to share their knowledge

892
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,318
about weed and share their weed and you

893
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,039
know share their level of glass like

894
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:48,119
with somebody who is just getting into

895
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,880
it so you know all those people uh you

896
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:54,440
know all those people were super cool OG

897
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:56,358
Rascal and the Paris OG people um I

898
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,119
never met the nameless people but I

899
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:00,799
really enjoyed their flower in the prop

900
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:04,640
215 days when it was more accessible and

901
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,519
grown in a way that was you know uh how

902
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:10,159
how people did it before the wck days

903
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:12,920
and how people are doing it now 100% I

904
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,159
think we're generally hopeful that the

905
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,400
[ __ ] TR

906
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,838
Kimber is a good representation of that

907
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,280
and I've smoked a ton of it so I don't I

908
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:20,799
don't need to be hopeful I know exactly

909
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,680
what's about to go on but what what do

910
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,119
you think of the dry it's super super

911
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:29,719
flavored forward on the dry

912
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,720
hit it's very

913
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:36,000
citrusy yeah man super citrusy almost

914
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:38,400
grapefruit from that dry hit which is

915
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
super

916
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,800
nice I'm with you it's not like a

917
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:49,920
skittles grapefruit but it totally

918
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:53,240
grapefruit it has gas it has uh it has

919
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,039
uh Funk it has a lot of citrus and it

920
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:57,039
has some grapefruit well I was going to

921
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,759
say it's almost like you know eating a

922
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,279
fresh white grapefruit where you're like

923
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,119
[ __ ] that's bitter yeah totally exactly

924
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,280
it has all those Citrus toes but there

925
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:08,599
like I don't think people saw but when I

926
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,480
moved my head back I closed my

927
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:13,680
eyes the

928
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,039
reaction exactly uh let's smell it and

929
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,919
then get into smoking it let's do

930
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:21,960
it there's nothing to smell because

931
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,680
we uh we just super cool you rolled up

932
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,000
the last of it but like yeah I blew

933
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,559
through a half zip of this um it was the

934
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,079
one that everyone wanted to see the most

935
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,759
I think it was and I may have mentioned

936
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,560
this earlier but the one that people

937
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,280
really sort of focused in on after the

938
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,440
previous drop earlier this year as as

939
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,119
being super special I think my

940
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,800
reflections of it were that it's yeah

941
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,640
it's a really good OG push and really

942
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,000
good OG Kush is for all of the reasons

943
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:53,679
that you described do it be informative

944
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,119
for you is just exceptional it's

945
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,919
well-rounded it's powerful it cuts

946
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,119
through everything else

947
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,240
it can be really

948
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:05,200
stive and it also is in a lot of ways

949
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:09,479
the heirloom strand of the city that you

950
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:13,399
know we both grew up in 100%

951
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,719
And yeah let's smoke it let's do it yeah

952
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,559
I mean often times most of my trips to

953
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:19,480
the

954
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:22,358
valley when I was around that age were

955
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,039
to go find some OG Kush and a lot of uh

956
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:26,440
a lot of good OG Kush was grown in the

957
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:29,440
valley also in you know the other

958
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:32,039
valleys too like s Gabriel Valley it's

959
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,079
uh it's cool I think the Central Valley

960
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,358
I think it's it's definitely a myth that

961
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,440
there's only good OG in Southern

962
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,000
California they're super good OG

963
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,519
everywhere they're super good everything

964
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,159
everywhere like the cuts that are still

965
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:47,000
alive and haven't totally suum to the

966
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,838
vroid can be found pretty much anywhere

967
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,239
they're are good Regional Specialties

968
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:55,279
but I thought some amazing Crush ground

969
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:57,719
all over yeah same absolutely yeah it's

970
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,960
just all based on you know what Growers

971
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:01,759
doing and what kind of genetics they got

972
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,838
and you

973
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,280
know any anybody in any place with the

974
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:11,239
right knowledge and experience and

975
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,680
genetics can grow some fire and I think

976
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:16,399
OG Kush is attributed as being one of

977
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:19,159
the parents to cookies alongside F1

978
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,440
Durban and so generally it's thought

979
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:24,480
that it's a common parent of everything

980
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,000
a lot of our favorite flavors right now

981
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,800
maybe me more than you are cookies types

982
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,039
stuff cross back to

983
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,519
OG all of that is to say I saw a post

984
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,599
recently from I think CSI humble that

985
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:39,000
will put something on the screen that

986
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,960
says it for real that suggests that

987
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,318
maybe through Gene mapping there

988
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:48,000
actually is no OG Coos in cookies which

989
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:49,960
could be really interesting um I think

990
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,639
that with a lot of older cultiv ours

991
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,240
they were bag seeds and people don't

992
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:57,639
know exactly what went into them yeah

993
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,559
but I just know that it's so

994
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:00,759
almost

995
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,679
axiomatic that like there's cush in

996
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,200
cookies there's cookies in everything

997
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,679
there's cush in everything um and I

998
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,919
think of it as being really foundational

999
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:10,639
so it'll it'll be interesting to see if

1000
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,720
as that gets explored more there are

1001
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:13,879
cool learnings and I also think the

1002
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:15,439
truth is there're a ton of different

1003
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,640
cuts of cookies as well as a ton of

1004
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,519
different cuts of kush totally and in

1005
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:23,279
what ways those are related be it bag

1006
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:27,679
seeds or just similar things that people

1007
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,160
then started marketing as being the same

1008
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,440
you

1009
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,558
know I'm just excited to maybe see what

1010
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,880
Gene mapping uncovers because I do think

1011
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,559
that while I do appreciate the

1012
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,760
anthropological approach and getting to

1013
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,000
to understand every region and

1014
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,280
subculture specific

1015
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
stories there's obviously like a UR name

1016
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,400
for some sort of empirical truth of

1017
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,519
course I'm also really excited to learn

1018
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,800
about cannabis Gene mapping because I

1019
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:58,599
feel like it's going to either help

1020
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,400
dispel rumors or confirm some of the uh

1021
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:03,359
Community knowledge that's been passed

1022
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,960
down about the origins of some of our

1023
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,880
favorite cannabis 100% And like OG Kush

1024
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,280
is some of our favorite cannabis and

1025
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,838
this is a super good example I think

1026
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,400
that while and I'm pretty sure this is

1027
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:18,078
what I articulated in the review um well

1028
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,039
there is a lot of lemon on the aroma and

1029
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,920
the dry pole not a whole lot in the

1030
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:26,880
Smoke yeah it's more of like a

1031
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,880
fuel gas almost kind of chem 91 totally

1032
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,280
and from an effects profile it's funny

1033
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,358
cuz people ask me all the time like how

1034
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,720
can you judge effects when you're

1035
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:36,159
smoking all the time and it really is

1036
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:38,598
just sort of the the color that you get

1037
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:41,039
and what you experience and good OG Kush

1038
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,838
always is slightly out of body but then

1039
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:47,119
I feel it in my MERS totally and like a

1040
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:49,039
good OG kush or like a good chm91 it's

1041
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,920
exactly that

1042
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:54,679
yeah yeah the power is really there with

1043
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,280
a lot of those good OG kushes the flavor

1044
00:43:54,679 --> 00:44:00,118
is musty for sure

1045
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,040
gassy

1046
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,800
dark what people describe as pushy and

1047
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,679
that's obviously like a

1048
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,440
self-referential thing but I think that

1049
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:14,239
if you know you know yeah um like little

1050
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,240
bits of root beer flavor sort of a

1051
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:24,119
barkness oh yeah totally there's the the

1052
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:28,000
forest notes the like earthy almost kind

1053
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:30,800
of like more like weird enough kind of

1054
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,920
like dirt notes or like Earth

1055
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,920
notes you

1056
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,318
know and I think you would mentioned

1057
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,640
leather um I think for the rainbow

1058
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:43,358
lemons yeah to me this has a sort of

1059
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:48,279
warm

1060
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:48,279
suede thing going on about the exale

1061
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,760
yeah strong

1062
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:57,640
though yeah this is definitely a fuel

1063
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:00,800
forward one we get a lot less of the

1064
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:03,719
Citrus there's some zestiness left on my

1065
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,680
palette maybe in the form of kind of the

1066
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:07,679
body of the

1067
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:07,679
smoke

1068
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:16,440
um lots of foresty earthy

1069
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:19,599
tones um like you said the leathery

1070
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,599
tones are coming through on

1071
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:26,039
this it's it's interesting because the

1072
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:29,920
the foresty tones aren't quite Pine but

1073
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:32,800
it more resembles like it just more

1074
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,880
resembles the

1075
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,318
like the scent and weirdly enough not

1076
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,800
that I have tasted it but just the dirt

1077
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:44,279
of like a Forest hiking path kind of

1078
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,318
like Northern California 100% And

1079
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,280
there's a zesty is an interesting word

1080
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:51,358
because to me it's not a citrus zest it

1081
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,960
almost reminds me of more moments where

1082
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,838
I've gone and smelled through different

1083
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,880
like scents and there's like a vet of

1084
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:01,799
her Puli kind of

1085
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,400
yeah there's incense but it's not hashy

1086
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,000
incense

1087
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,720
like it definitely has some incens notes

1088
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,119
though and it's some

1089
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:17,000
pressure yeah just a few hits in I'm

1090
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,519
incredibly faded I mean it OG Kush makes

1091
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,119
me feel

1092
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:22,679
like you know I'm taking bong rip

1093
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,599
sitting in one of those houses in one of

1094
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:28,399
the really scary movies yeah totally

1095
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,720
just I don't know like way before I ever

1096
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,039
smoked how I imagin smoking would feel

1097
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,959
yeah 100% that's what the cush shows

1098
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:38,239
exactly I

1099
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,838
mean the Kush is powerful absolutely

1100
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:42,439
powerful I've only probably taken five

1101
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:44,880
or six hits off the whole thing at this

1102
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:48,480
whole point and you know it's already

1103
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:52,000
impacting my vocabulary my Cadence it's

1104
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,800
[ __ ] strong um OJ Kush is some of the

1105
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,159
best stuff ever I think that generally I

1106
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,079
prefer an OG that has more that

1107
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:07,358
pinea thrust to it but some people do

1108
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:09,599
prefer these more modern Roy ogs and in

1109
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,759
that subcategory this is about as good

1110
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,800
as it gets totally and I understand why

1111
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,000
it generated all the hype that led into

1112
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,480
this drop and it's going to generate

1113
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,358
more hype going into the next one

1114
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,760
because this is good good OG cush and

1115
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:24,119
they're really only a couple of dudes

1116
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,160
doing it right and I feel like we're

1117
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:30,559
super lucky to get to know at least a

1118
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:32,960
few it though mhm absolutely I think

1119
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,920
because OG push at the highest quality

1120
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,838
is something that's so accessible to us

1121
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,079
as I'm sort of reflecting more on the

1122
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,880
the entire Drop the Rainbow lemons is

1123
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,240
the one that I'd go back to yeah the

1124
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,280
rainbow lemons is awesome I really liked

1125
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:49,759
the Euphoria we got off of that it was a

1126
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,640
pretty instant head change from blue

1127
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,800
ivory

1128
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:56,879
um I also you know happen to be in

1129
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:00,359
proximity with a lot of good OG Kush and

1130
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,800
and um I'm thankful for that but I think

1131
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:04,358
I would have to say the rainbow lemons

1132
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,559
is also what I would go back

1133
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:08,519
for yeah but I think we're just

1134
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,760
generally really blessed in general to

1135
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,318
get to smoke very good OG kach and if

1136
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,960
you were someone where that isn't

1137
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:17,960
available to you and you came across

1138
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,079
this jar I think it's the one that would

1139
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,559
give you that oh [ __ ] that's fire

1140
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:27,318
response totally and we're a little bit

1141
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,319
jaded when it comes to Kush

1142
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:35,318
this does have like a seismic yeah

1143
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:37,239
heaviness I think I feel

1144
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:39,679
gravity it's like you're being pushed

1145
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:41,598
down into the floor and the palette is

1146
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,879
really straightforward I think that I

1147
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,559
could confuse it for and you know it's

1148
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,838
hard to say cuz I wasn't around when

1149
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,480
this one was originally around but like

1150
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:52,440
the expressions of chem 91 that I've

1151
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,960
tried taste a lot like this

1152
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:58,240
yeah totally and there's an earthiness

1153
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,838
that I associate with certain more

1154
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,838
rustic

1155
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:06,119
kushes that's present here but paired

1156
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:09,240
with a really strong kind of thin

1157
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:12,599
natural gas kind of jet fuel yeah

1158
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:14,759
that you makes it very very special and

1159
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:17,440
and the potency is

1160
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,599
just out of this world yeah it's really

1161
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,838
strong um it gives me it gives me nice

1162
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:26,960
like OG chush Nostalgia which I love

1163
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:29,480
every time I get to enjoy good OG um

1164
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,920
it reminds me of uh reminds me of lots

1165
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,679
of the good stuff that I tried back in

1166
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,039
the day I can't really put my finger on

1167
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,639
what it is but the nostalgic Factor the

1168
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:41,759
flavor and sense memories are there

1169
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:44,679
sweet yeah so I think that it's probably

1170
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:47,839
time for us to wrap it up I'm really

1171
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:50,798
glad that we picked OG for the end but

1172
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:53,119
oh yeah generally this was awesome yeah

1173
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:56,960
this was great I think that I am

1174
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,400
pleasantly surprised I think that to be

1175
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,480
completely honest the going rate for

1176
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,519
this flower is more than I'm typically

1177
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,838
willing to spend on

1178
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:09,400
anything um there is a lot of really

1179
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:12,759
incredible flow available for a little

1180
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,480
bit less than this is going for but this

1181
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,200
is also thoughtfully grown small batch

1182
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,039
flower they were feno hunting which

1183
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:24,239
takes up a lot of space

1184
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:26,679
and once or twice a year I'm happy to

1185
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:30,439
support at this level yeah totally this

1186
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:32,318
this is great stuff and you know we um

1187
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,838
we enjoyed each joint thoroughly I mean

1188
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:37,039
it was uh it was truly like a flavor and

1189
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:39,759
experience flight it kind of brought us

1190
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:42,880
like uh brought us on a sine wave of

1191
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:46,640
experiences and we're um we're lucky to

1192
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,760
end it with this super sedative OG yeah

1193
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:51,879
it's fire um you know I think I had a

1194
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,520
super good time doing this me too I'm

1195
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,079
excited to do it again I think that we

1196
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:59,838
have way too many flavers from locals

1197
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:02,318
only to get through we also have the

1198
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:04,119
ability to do some of beer boo stuff out

1199
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,880
of Michigan which would be really cool

1200
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:08,960
so be super cool we'll hopefully get to

1201
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,559
