so particularly excited about this

38
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:30,399
donnie burger which is han solo burger

39
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,438
xgmo the han solo burger is gmo x lario

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,200
g

41
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:38,798
um gmo you know chem x cookies

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,960
so a ton of gmo chem terps i think in

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,118
this obviously

44
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,438
too it's the rubber glove squared and i

45
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,840
like to i like to describe the like

46
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,839
super like acrid like

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
uh almost kind of like some people might

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,359
call it a fuel ear chem terp i like to

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,680
call it that like rubber glove or latex

50
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,718
glove tip it's just like pungent and

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,799
like it hits your nose it's like it's

52
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,959
it's really acrid and i really enjoy

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
that and honestly associate that with a

54
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,280
lot of cannabis that gets me really

55
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,280
really stoned totally specifically the

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
gmos because you've got what like four

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,439
different instances of gmo showing up in

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,959
this like genetic a lot of cam

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,719
engineering yeah a lot of chemicals for

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
sure and it's what's really exciting is

61
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,239
this is an outdoor

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,840
grow and there's a lot of

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,280
buzz going on right now around the chart

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,200
that was developed by the emerald cup

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,039
indicating that you know you see

66
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,719
significantly higher terpene percentages

67
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,359
and outdoor flowers and like you were

68
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,000
saying this has that acrid tennis ball

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
but also really meaty like kind of bacon

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
grease

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,199
and also not dissimilar i mean i don't

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
know why it would be awesome if someone

73
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,639
could tell us in the comments where the

74
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,719
burger came from and han solo burger but

75
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,799
there's a meaty quality definitely it's

76
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,199
like when you're frying bacon and it

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,719
just fills the kitchen for hours and

78
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,000
fills your nose and you can't get rid of

79
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,439
the smell but

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,959
you know the way i described that some

81
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,079
might not think of as very pleasant but

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,439
with this

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,959
with this donnie burger it's quite

84
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,039
pleasant and i think there's a real

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,878
movement back towards chem terms there's

86
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,878
a lot of discussion around

87
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,039
candy and the candy way of being over

88
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,679
and people wanting to go back to gas and

89
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,000
ogs and i think for a lot of purists

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,599
that's chem 91 totally like okay so i

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,519
just cracked this right now we'll both

92
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:19,039
take a sniff a bit

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,879
this right now is just like it honestly

94
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,039
like it it honestly kind of smells like

95
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,798
oatmeal like a fresh thing of oats like

96
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,919
the funk of the grains and like the

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,360
and i know some people might think

98
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,679
that's a bland description but i think

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,959
it's a very like significantly funky

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
description like

101
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,000
like almost like

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
you know to get into the kind of wine

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,519
descriptors almost like uh like a barn

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,759
floor hay kinda there totally is a

105
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,080
grassy quality i also got a buttered

106
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,199
popcorn when i was smelling it last but

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,799
that chem dude that [ __ ] that glove

108
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,560
smell and here i'll hand off this nug

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,959
that i just cracked for you to smell and

110
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
invigorate your senses you're thinking

111
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,560
we don't know where this was grown but

112
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,760
it was clearly

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,158
grown under beautiful sunlight in

114
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,878
really rich healthy soil and the flower

115
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:10,798
indicates you know a very happy growing

116
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,399
environment really a lot of the textural

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,680
qualities

118
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,439
that you would see in outdoor

119
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
are mitigated by just how overwhelmingly

120
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,918
sticky this is to me i think that while

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
it's not incredibly frosty it has great

122
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,639
trichome definition and it was clearly

123
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
you know living in an environment where

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,680
it wanted to produce all of those

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
natural defenses definitely i think um

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,879
this one was possibly done in northern

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,759
california which as many people know is

128
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,879
one of the best um best tier wars in

129
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,000
california for growing outdoor cannabis

130
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,719
possibly mendocino possibly humboldt um

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,478
but

132
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,639
looking at this it's just it looks like

133
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,399
a really happy plant looks like it was a

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,160
very happy plant i mean just on the way

135
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,519
this is growing the you know the

136
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,680
[Music]

137
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,279
the little leaves and the calyxes are

138
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,680
pointing up like the whole thing was

139
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,959
praying its whole life so

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,639
it's definitely an indicator that

141
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,719
something's good and it's swollen and

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,918
greasy it's

143
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,320
all right guys we're going to roll this

144
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,918
one up now um

145
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,918
we've smoked this one already and it got

146
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,279
us incredibly high but ultimately the

147
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,279
best test is going to be smoking on

148
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,638
camera and describing the experience as

149
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,198
it happens

150
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
um but we we really enjoy this donnie

151
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,038
burger

152
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
it's

153
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,918
definitely a strong one um just similar

154
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,680
to the gmos and the chems

155
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,519
uh you know wait till i'm done clacking

156
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
this to describe it

157
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,680
there's a narcotic profile to the

158
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,520
terpenes i mean even when you're

159
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,560
smelling it in the room

160
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:44,959
there's something woozy and skunky yeah

161
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,879
it will absolutely do the trick

162
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,038
definitely

163
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,839
so we're gonna light this joint up here

164
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,759
once again this is the donnie burger

165
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,839

00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,079
i think

170
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,879
and z are the two strains right now

171
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,959
where

172
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,680
i don't mind that someone is just

173
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,680
inbreeding it to itself totally

174
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,519
you can you know double up on some of

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,680
those amazing qualities of those strains

176
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,240
and take it in different directions i i

177
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,600
do think there's there's a distinct

178
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,079
meatiness to this that is interesting

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,039
yeah right off the bat the flavor is

180
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,038
really

181
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,879
chemi gmoe

182
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,560
uh definitely like

183
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,319
full bodied smoke

184
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
um you get some of that garlic you get

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,879
some of that fuel you get some of that

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
meatiness

187
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,759
let's take another puff

188
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,080
just off the aroma of the smoke i'm

189
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,759
getting that acrid raw garlic for sure

190
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,279
yeah definitely some garlic very like

191
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,560
you know when i say accurate i don't

192
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,279
mean

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,879
anything you know unpleasant but it's

194
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,239
you know if you've smoked a lot of gmo

195
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,918
or a lot of cam you know what i'm

196
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,598
talking about

197
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,719
and i think that unfortunately we were

198
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:07,759
born too late for it but

199
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,639
those skunk one terps and those true

200
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,879
really funky dead body road kill terps

201
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,280
yeah people the poopies some people call

202
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,279
it yeah

203
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,879
not necessarily a negative thing no

204
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,959
people breed stuff for those poopings we

205
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,959
were highlighting this earlier and i'm

206
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:28,079
feeling it again it's a very smooth

207
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,239
smoke the ash isn't as clean as some

208
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,038
indoor and that is to be expected i

209
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,879
think

210
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,199
but

211
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,079
now going into our third joint of this

212
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,759
neither of us have coughed yeah and it's

213
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,758
very pleasant interpret on my

214
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,080
respiratory system i enjoy it yeah it's

215
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,000
a really good joint the inhale has all

216
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,399
that funk and that chem and the fuel and

217
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,918
then the exhale is pleasantly sweet

218
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,318
almost like they may have like finished

219
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,959
with a molasses or something like that

220
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,120
um i know personally in my garden in the

221
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,918
past we finished with a molasses type

222
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,560
product or a sugar type product just to

223
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,560
sweeten it up

224
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,000
but you know there's all kinds of ways

225
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,359
to do that including just letting the

226
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,079
genetics rock

227
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,520
um you saying that

228
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,598
i do get

229
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,598
a distinctly

230
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,598
molassesy

231
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,639
flavor yeah on the back end i wonder

232
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,719
what that is it's almost like

233
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,800
gingerbread really delicious totally

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,879
overall this is a very pleasant smoke

235
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,439
the joints burning great

236
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,039
the you know there's apparent resin

237
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,320
at the top some people call that the

238
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:33,838
resin ring

239
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,599
um

240
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,279
yeah overall really pleasant and the

241
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,560
stone you know i've smoked this is my

242
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,120
third one now

243
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,799
the high on it is really really good at

244
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,320
first it's kind of clear-headed as you

245
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,079
start to feel it build behind your eyes

246
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
but then it becomes like a really

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,200
powerful you know full mind and body

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,399
stone

249
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,200
and while the bag appeal is not the same

250
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,799
as some of the indoor production work

251
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,879
that is definitely more popular than

252
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,479
this i i would say that this smokes

253
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,559
significantly

254
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
better yeah you're not going to find

255
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,079
something as good as you know this

256
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,480
outdoor donnie burger at a dispensary

257
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,480
that's for sure

258
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,439
and now that we're a couple minutes into

259
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,278
this joint

260
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,279
the effects are pretty consistent to

261
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,838
when we smoked it last

262
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,759
it's pressure behind my eyes for sure

263
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,200
it's it's a classic

264
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,759
more indica type high it's super

265
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,320
pleasant and something

266
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,399
but it isn't a straight thc blast which

267
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,399
is what gets me

268
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,639
excited about trying outdoor

269
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,278
um i think so many of the strains that

270
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,439
are being bred for the metric market and

271
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,159
percentages

272
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
are really

273
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,720
unfocused and just

274
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,039
a neurological blast and it's just

275
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,360
not as pleasant as something like this

276
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,360
that does feel

277
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,560
very harmonious and it makes sense that

278
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,800
nature constructed both definitely

279
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,199
i feel like with these organic terroir

280
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:10,559
based outdoor terps you know

281
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,480
you're getting a euphoric pleasant

282
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,958
in pretty you know individualized to the

283
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,720
strain experience that's based on how it

284
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,639
was grown and you know what kind of you

285
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,759
know inputs and genetics and stuff too

286
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,240
but really

287
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,720
when you get those uh

288
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,360
i i guess the simplest way to put it is

289
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,959
this weed makes you feel really good um

290
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,720
the living soil outdoor type weed just

291
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,879
it's euphoric on another level and you

292
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,879
can't compare that to dispensary hydro

293
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,240
weed which you know

294
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,919
to a lot of people would just make you

295
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,399
feel kind of panicky whereas this stuff

296
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,278
really makes you feel enlightened or

297
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,200
just

298
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,519
great to be honest

299
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,680
yeah it does feel like

300
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,440
slide it or not

301
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,120
i've heard people

302
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,600
describe

303
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,600
thc as like being the engine of a plane

304
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,040
and the terpenes as being the rudders

305
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
and when things are

306
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,480
you know out of balance the plane

307
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,399
crashes right

308
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
um so it's

309
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,360
a joy to smoke something that's sort of

310
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,120
harmonious yeah definitely

311
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,639
yeah

312
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,399
i mean this is just absolutely

313
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,000
incredible if you can get your hands on

314
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,559
