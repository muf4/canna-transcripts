2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:06,160
okay

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
so today i'm going to be sharing with

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,599
you the first of many tips

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,039
just little things that can save you

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,080
time or make your life a little bit

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,678
easier

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,480
some of you may know these things

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,480
already but for those of you who don't

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,920
you'll see it and you'll face palm

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,800
because there's a lot of things that we

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,880
can do

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,839
that save us a lot of time that makes

14
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,000
life easier

15
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,960
that are common sense but you don't know

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,359
until you know

17
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
so that's the point of these tips so

18
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,480
today what i'm going to do is show you

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
how to make transplanting a little bit

20
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,599
easier on your life

21
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,920
i've already started we're going to be

22
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,239
up potting and i've already started with

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,679
a new bucket i call them buckets they're

24
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,159
containers they're pots they're whatever

25
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,479
they are

26
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,319
i call them buckets and i've also

27
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,199
pre-filled a little bit of dirt

28
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,558
because when you put your existing plant

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,879
and root ball in

30
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,878
you want to make sure that it's sitting

31
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,000
at about the same height

32
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,599
you know you might be able to bury a

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,079
little bit of stem if you need to in the

34
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
earlier

35
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,600
ages i'll show you that in a minute but

36
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
for now

37
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,280
we would typically be putting something

38
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,280
with a decent size root ball

39
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,599
and we want to make sure it has some

40
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,599
extra soil to go down into

41
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,438
i'm going to leave it exactly like it is

42
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,000
it's at the nice height

43
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,839
good equal distance all around it so let

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,079
me just start filling in the soil for

45
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,079
you

46
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,679
and i use you know a little tray

47
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
underneath try to

48
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,159
prevent it from getting all over the

49
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,920
place obviously if you're on a concrete

50
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
floor or if you have a tarp that makes

51
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,600
life a lot easier and clean up

52
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
i've got a broom i'm not too worried

53
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,078
about it

54
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
i'm just going to keep filling it in and

55
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,920
if if the soil goes into

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,359
the middle pot don't worry about it

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,359
we'll take advantage of that later

58
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,000
okay so we're getting close to the top

59
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:55,359
of it

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,319
i'm gonna just smooth it out a little

61
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,239
bit and i am going to give it a little

62
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,679
bit of a push down just

63
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,158
gently kind of make sure it binds

64
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,759
against the side of the pot you know

65
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
solid wall

66
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,439
you don't want to push it down too much

67
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,000
you don't want to create compaction

68
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,680
a good root zone needs oxygen if you

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
just push it all down

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,920
you're not doing yourself any favors so

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,840
just go gently but

72
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,839
do get it a little bit tight

73
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,159
okay looks good to me i have all this

74
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,598
stuff in the center

75
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,039
i told you not to worry about it and

76
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,159
here's where it kind of comes in handy

77
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:37,840
you can take it

78
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,840
and you just scoop it to the outside

79
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,519
and that kind of fills it in and brings

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,039
you to the level

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,400
that you are going to need so nice and

82
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,159
simple there

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
again it's gonna bring that to the level

84
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,840
that you need nice and simple

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,680
life is good happy little pottery

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,439
potty pot pots happy little perlites and

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,640
soil clouds for microbes good stuff

88
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:12,000
okay so what we're going to basically do

89
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,639
is give this a little twist and a shout

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
then we pull it out and now you have a

91
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,238
perfect hole

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,680
so when you take your pot or your plant

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,239
out of here

94
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
and you're going to plug it in boom you

95
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
got something perfect to plug it into

96
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,039
and again it's not super tight we want

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,680
that oxygen we want that air in there

98
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,878
we get our new plant we'd plug it right

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,400
in

100
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,959
maybe give it a little bit more of a

101
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,640
temp down maybe put some extra topsoil

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,319
on top of it

103
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,000
give it a water and you're good to go

104
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,839
and now that we've covered the big pot

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
we're gonna do the little pot this is

106
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,239
typically

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,878
my progress of a potting i like to start

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,719
all my clones all my seeds in a small

109
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,759
four by four tray

110
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,359
i typically will then move them up to a

111
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,479
gallon pot

112
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,560
and finally into a three gallon pot

113
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,598
which for the size of the tents that i'm

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
growing in

115
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,679
is really the maximum size that i want

116
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,599
to get i could use larger pots but i'm

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,959
going to get a lot larger plants

118
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,879
and while larger plants sound great

119
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
i don't necessarily want that because of

120
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,759
the amount that i have

121
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,759
and the space that i have so

122
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,198
plug that back in there we're going to

123
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,159
walk through this just like we did the

124
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,720
other one

125
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,439
doesn't fit so i need to add some soil

126
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,520
in the bottom

127
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,519
of the pot first all right let's do that

128
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,360
and i'm gonna say that that is a little

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,519
too much

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
a lot of times when you put a seed in

131
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,758
there it'll get a bit of a stretch so

132
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
the cotyledon which is the very very

133
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,960
little first leaf

134
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
um not even really a leaf but let's not

135
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,599
get too technical

136
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,079
it will stretch up so oftentimes you can

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
bury

138
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,199
the stem up to that so what i'm going to

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,839
do is i'm just going to take a little

140
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,919
bit

141
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,918
back it out basically let's do that

142
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,758
so that actually looks like it's going

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
to be perfect

144
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,840
and it is a tighter fit so again this

145
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,759
time like i said last time

146
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,758
if you spill the soil into that middle

147
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,600
container don't worry you'll use it at

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,720
the end it's actually very useful so

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,720
let's fill it up again

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,439
and now i'm just going to take the stuff

151
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,719
from the middle fill the outsides and

152
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,839
make it perfect to

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,840
my heart's desire yeah

154
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,758
okay that looks like it's ready so just

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
like the last time little twist and

156
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,038
shout

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,439
and pull it out and you got your perfect

158
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,759
hole

159
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:59,519
to put your seedling in now see

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,038
i hope you guys enjoyed i'd love to hear

161
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,439
any tips you guys have

162
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,639
and we will be doing this every show

163
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,839
thank you for tuning in

164
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
i'm chad westport
