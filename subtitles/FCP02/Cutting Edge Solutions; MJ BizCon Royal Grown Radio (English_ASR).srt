breeze about what's going on and you

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,960
know telling the story of mj biz khan

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,559
that it's been going on for 10 years now

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,799

mj biz too wow really no isn't that

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,479
crazy that is a little crazy so

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,399
surprising i was always doing other

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,759
events well we were just talking about

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,920
that in a little live segment that we

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,839
just did where you know even when this

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,519
thing has gotten as big as it was in

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
2019 the last time they did it there's

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,560
still a ton of people in this industry

33
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,559
that are big players that still haven't

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,118
made it and there is this thing that

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,400
where you know it's it's so new for this

36
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,319
industry that's been you know

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
traditionally in the shadows

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,919
you know to do an expo like this it's

39
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,280
still something that people are still

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,200
just kind of testing the waters out and

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,519
putting their feet in and seeing if you

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,799
know what they think about it so welcome

43
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,640
man i'm glad you finally made it dude

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,079
sure oh yeah it's awesome and yeah it's

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
it's interesting walking around seeing

46
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,639
all these different companies that i've

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,719
never seen before and this is like las

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,239
vegas itself is a place where

49
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,118
everyone comes out of the woodworks and

50
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,438
it's it's cool to see new innovations

51
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,599
new products and you know the same old

52
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,758
faces too of course i agree i feel like

53
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,039
every time i come here and i get away

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,879
from whatever it is what we're doing at

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,079
the booth and whatever you know walking

56
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,640
around i every year i get reminded that

57
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,039
there's never a point in this industry

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,118
where you feel like you're comfortably

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,600
at a place of knowing everything or

60
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,438
calling yourself a master grower there's

61
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,519
always some new stuff coming out that's

62
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,799
about to blow my mind and it's

63
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,878
unfortunate that when you're here for

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,920
work purposes we don't always get to

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,359
dive into the actual trade show and get

66
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,039
enough time to walk around and see all

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,640
the booths that the actual attendees do

68
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,120
well it's really cool there's so many

69
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,279
experts in each little niche but it's so

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
hard to be a true industry-wide expert

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,000
these days with such a diverse

72
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,199
flow of products and techniques and all

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,598
of this stuff

74
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,399
it's really hard to have a great

75
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,479
comprehensive grasp on the entire scope

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,800
of the industry so you're seeing people

77
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,399
really hone in and specialize i'm the

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,480
lighting guy i am the ventilation guy i

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
am the extract guy and

80
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,318
really

81
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,919
being focused and if you pay attention

82
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,359
to those experts you can kind of get a

83
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,280
little bit of a balance and that's what

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,760
we're trying to do here you know we're

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,598
so entrenched in the cultivation side

86
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,039
being with royal gold you guys being

87
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,639
with cutting edge

88
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,318
i think it's really important that we

89
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,158
kind of keep our

90
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,158
eyes on the prize but keep up with

91
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,399
what's going on in the industry because

92
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,000
in cultivation it's advising all the

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,000
other portions like are you cultivating

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,199
for chirping profile are you cultivating

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,039
for thc content are you cultivating hemp

96
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,919
cbd like there's so many different

97
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,239
things like kevin you're in tennessee so

98
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,479
you see a lot of a different side of the

99
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,920
industry than we see in the west coast

100
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,158
tell us a little bit about what's going

101
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,280
on in cultivation world in tennessee oh

102
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,479
yeah um well tuning back to kind of the

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,719
uh

104
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,439
the uh everybody getting in on their

105
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,000
niche and finding their specialty and

106
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,680
and going 100 into that that's where you

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,878
see the most successful companies the

108
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,879
ones that are

109
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,959
you know playing to what they know

110
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,439
consulting with their existing base

111
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,280
finding new customers and and going that

112
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,519
route and some of the companies that try

113
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
to do it all are the ones that don't

114
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
survive so

115
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,280
you see a lot of that and it's nice to

116
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,000
uh you know play on each other's brands

117
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,039
and build a community verse you know try

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
to try to create a one-man show

119
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,919
cultivation uh side of the eastern and

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,519
central u.s

121
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,639
unfortunately tennessee is not blowing

122
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,040
up on the indoor and uh and craft

123
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,199
cannabis scene um

124
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,560
hemp industry hemp industries blowing up

125
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,600
we've got i think

126
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,439
3 200 cultivation license out there

127
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,840
unlimited plant count

128
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:33,600
um you know that's a crazy wild world

129
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:36,079
with uh a lot of fluctuations in in uh

130
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,080
you know price per pound and biomass and

131
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,800
everything so a lot of people are

132
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,279
scaling back or or uh

133
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
or you know toning it down to be

134
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,799
um

135
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,880
more in a safe zone rather than you know

136
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,520
doing 60 acres and having to supply a

137
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,560
30-man labor crew and everything a lot

138
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,359
of people are

139
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,800
are toning it back and going more green

140
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,400
greenhouse and

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
and craft style cultivation

142
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,199
in the central united states right now

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
we're seeing

144
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,720
our biggest growth in in areas like

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,439
missouri and illinois and florida and

146
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
then

147
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,918
obviously michigan and up into the

148
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,160
northeast but it's nice to see

149
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,879
some of these new markets go live in the

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,880
central u.s like illinois per se where

151
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,719
they have home cultivation they have

152
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,719
commercial cultivation

153
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,720
and then they uh you know the culture is

154
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,039
really starting to evolve there

155
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,639
um and it's it's kind of um on the home

156
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,599
cultivation side

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,840
it takes me back to michigan 10 12 years

158
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,199
ago yeah it's in its infancy there yes

159
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:44,239
yes so we're seeing a lot of energy

160
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,639
a lot of positive community growth and

161
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,918
uh and just a lot of uh really good

162
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
things coming out of the out of the

163
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,038
midwest and the central us in those

164
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,198
markets missouri is one

165
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,399
just like that where they have a really

166
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,720
healthy

167
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,318
home cultivation model for caregivers

168
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,240
and stuff so

169
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,960
the retail market's healthy

170
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,478
the

171
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,159
culture and the community of the home

172
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,560
growers is healthy and then you also

173
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,039
have the the big corporations and

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,280
commercial facilities coming in to do

175
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,399
large-scale production so

176
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,799
we're really excited to see see this

177
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,638
cultivating in the midwest and then even

178
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,560
down into the southeast now with with

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,960
virginia uh so yeah virginia so big yeah

180
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,839
i love that there is some

181
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,120
preservation of the medical small

182
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,359
homegrown

183
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,038
cultivation style in these new emerging

184
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,639
markets and that's something

185
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,360
we've seen in a lot of markets that's

186
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,960
kind of scary and really inhibits growth

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,680
is when the people at home aren't

188
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,159
allowed to grow and there's very strict

189
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,560
large-scale regulation and all these

190
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,639
hurdles and barriers to entering you

191
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
know in florida you have to have had a

192
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,598
greenhouse license an existing

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,319
greenhouse business for the 80s since

194
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,360
yes

195
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,199
40 years 30 40 years to actually get one

196
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,080
of the commercials don't have homegrown

197
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,840
so you know which is you know

198
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,800
i think that that's one of the most

199
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,198
negative things that an emerging

200
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,120
market can do is limit in that way you

201
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,520
gotta let people come in fresh the

202
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,478
people that have been adversely affected

203
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,959
by

204
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,360
uneven law enforcement i think is huge

205
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,918
too like there's no way that somebody

206
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,479
that was busted for growing cannabis in

207
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,680
the 90s can effectively participate in

208
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,519
florida because there's no way they

209
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,439
could have owned a business while they

210
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,839
were serving time for having

211
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,598
an ounce of pot so

212
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,198
it's really these barriers to entry to

213
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,598
the people that built the industry and

214
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,520
fought for it for so long it really kind

215
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,598
of bothers me and you see places like

216
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,198
illinois where you're allowed to do it

217
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,038
on a small scale and you see people

218
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,960
excited about it missouri too like you

219
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,519
were saying that speaks to us as

220
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,079
cultivators people who got into it with

221
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,639
three plants or two lights and

222
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,680
built our knowledge base from this like

223
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,160
little

224
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,360
germ of an idea of having to hide in a

225
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
closet

226
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,720
yeah i love that the you know the aspect

227
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,399
of actually you know the home grows

228
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,840
getting put into the laws as these

229
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,359
states come online

230
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,359
you know the medicinal aspect of

231
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,800
consuming the plant is obviously it's a

232
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,400
huge factor

233
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,079
you know the part of growing the plant

234
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,079
the connection with actually growing

235
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,000
plants is something that you know

236
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,839
there's so many people that would never

237
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,439
really take that on as a hobby and

238
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,318
there's something so healing and

239
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,639
therapeutic and medicinal about getting

240
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,039
into the cultivation of a plant and and

241
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,680
developing your relationship as a human

242
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,038
to a plant or to your garden i think

243
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,319
there's there's such a fine balance

244
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,080
there now as these states come online

245
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,919
and actually you know push forward on

246
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,440
the home grow i think that that is such

247
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,918
a crucial thing for our society to get

248
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,600
back into nature in that regard

249
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,679
absolutely so

250
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,278
sean you've been with

251
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,319
cutting edge solutions for a good long

252
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,080
while now but you've been in the

253
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,600
industry for longer

254
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,639
and across a kind of interesting expanse

255
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,639
of different occupations and niches in

256
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,319
their career yeah kind of floated around

257
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,399
what are you seeing now

258
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
and like in your involvement in

259
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,440
cutting-edge solutions through these

260
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,879
home grows like

261
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,800
give us a little bit of your perspective

262
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,720
on the industry yeah so like

263
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,879
eight eight to ten years ago i was

264
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
wrapping up in the northwest so oregon

265
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,120
and washington and it was right around

266
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,200
the time when they were becoming legal

267
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,120
medical programs were rolling out and i

268
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,680
watched just like you guys were talking

269
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,360
about the rise and fall of washington

270
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,199
right that was one of the biggest most

271
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,680
emerging markets especially for home

272
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,080
growers and all of a sudden licenses

273
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,399
came out and homegrown got cancelled and

274
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,560
it destroyed a lot of not just the

275
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,159
cultivators but our industry as a whole

276
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,239
grow shops closed

277
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,759
every single like half of them closed up

278
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,919
in the seattle region

279
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,439
and that really destroyed the

280
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,199
the whole premise of

281
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
why we wanted cannabis to be legal in

282
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
the first place we just wanted to not be

283
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,120
messed with by the government right and

284
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,879
now it's become regulated not really

285
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,759
legal in that sense

286
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,519
but you know as the industry is evolving

287
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,480
do you think we'd be talking about legal

288
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,000
cannabis in missouri five years ago so

289
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
it's it's really cool to see that

290
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
happening but there's there's some good

291
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,799
things happening there's some bad things

292
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,759
happening and it's kind of all across

293
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,559
the board

294
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,879
but

295
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,799
the west coast the saturation is there

296
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,439
for sure you know farmers are kind of

297
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,599
hurting out there and i think the the

298
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,120
national model is is adding to that you

299
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
know pounds from oklahoma are going to

300
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,879
new york city all the time

301
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,639
and that takes away from the california

302
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,000
growers that have been doing it for 30

303
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,439
40 years on heritage farms i mean for

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
what it's worth the same thing's

305
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
happening all across the world now and

306
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,399
that's something that i feel like you

307
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,719
know it's going to lean heavily on you

308
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,679
know federal legislation changing you

309
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,560
know at some point i feel like

310
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,159
the natural you know the ability to

311
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,399
create a cheaper

312
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,719
well-crafted you know pound of cannabis

313
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
in california or oregon or washington in

314
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,920
these drier climates

315
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
you know that might change landscape

316
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,559
scape especially when you're talking

317
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
about possibly shipping out you know

318
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,359
overseas

319
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,440
for sure yeah we were just talking i was

320
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,200
talking with jose our sales rep who

321
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,600
deals a lot with mexico and colombia for

322
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,759
us and a company in colombia just signed

323
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,240
a 60 million dollar contract for

324
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,240
exporting flour to the u.s

325
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,519
and they can produce flour for pennies

326
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,639
on the gram

327
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,159
totally it's insane and so you see these

328
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,360
federal

329
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,159
kind of

330
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,120
hurdles slowing everything down and

331
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:30,559
really a big problem to me is that the

332
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,959
federal government's failure to act and

333
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,559
kind of support the greater national

334
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,639
distribution model

335
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,958
is dismantling

336
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,559
the existing industry in california and

337
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,399
oregon and places that have been doing

338
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,879
it so

339
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,720
by dragging their feet they're creating

340
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,278
an environment where

341
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,360
all these legacy growers are going to be

342
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,078
underwater by the time

343
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,240
we open up to a

344
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,919
an export model within the united states

345
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
being able to throw

346
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,278
a semi-load of cannabis from different

347
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,440
growers

348
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,360
in california out to new york out to

349
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,000
michigan out to these emerging markets

350
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,919
and if we can get some traction

351
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,839
get a lot of the people who are active

352
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,078
in the community in the legislation

353
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,839
writing these state legislations

354
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,519
and then pushing it up the next level to

355
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,200
their senators and pushing for the

356
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,360
federal we might be able to get over

357
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,639
this hurdle and preserve some of this

358
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,039
long time legacy farming and influence

359
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,680
of the people from the 60s 70s and 80s

360
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,078
that built this industry that allowed us

361
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,199
to be where we are today we wouldn't be

362
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,958
here talking about this in las vegas

363
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,120
at a public convention center if it

364
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,399
wasn't for those people that risked

365
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,679
everything

366
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,480
in all out

367
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,719
domestic warfare to produce cannabis for

368
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,720
all of us to consume so

369
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,839
hats off to all you legacy growers and

370
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,278
farmers yeah i mean the emerald triangle

371
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
as a brand

372
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,240
is

373
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,360
in demand worldwide so if we had the

374
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,959
ability to market that internationally

375
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,720
it would you know

376
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,599
set northern california for a market

377
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,040
that's sustainable for decades if not

378
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,040
you know a century

379
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,120
yeah and everyone in california was so

380
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,799
excited about it we're the napa we're up

381
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,399
in humble we're in the emerald triangle

382
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,879
we're going to be the napa of cannabis

383
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,519
we're going to everybody wants this

384
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,360
but they can't get it yeah and that's

385
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,519
that's kind of our focal point of moving

386
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,360
into markets like columbia right now

387
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,078
they are building their legislation on

388
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,959
export right now they are exporting to

389
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,599
germany and the uk and these markets

390
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,119
that only allow import into pharmacies

391
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,879
and stuff so

392
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,639
it's unique seeing that happen in other

393
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,639
parts of the world and and you know we

394
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
want to be a part of that

395
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,240
wow yeah and not being as familiar with

396
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,240
the international as you guys are i know

397
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,560
you were just down in colombia you just

398
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,879
did the big expo down in mexico yeah in

399
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,039
mexico tell us more about that because

400
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,399
if the u.s could get off its ass and get

401
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,319
some legislation and we could be

402
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,039
exporting to spain and all these other

403
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,560
places with our california cannabis i

404
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,958
think it would be a different world

405
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,958
totally and and what's really cool about

406
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,559
columbia and mexico especially the trade

407
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,000
shows we went to

408
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,319
it looks like

409
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,559
northern california 15 years ago

410
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,160
everybody wants knowledge they're hungry

411
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,919
for knowledge and they want to do things

412
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,399
the right way because those two

413
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:21,120
countries specifically don't trust gmos

414
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,919
they don't trust monsanto they've banned

415
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
uh roundup they've banned gmos and

416
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,039
that's the same model they're using for

417
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,079
cannabis they want to do it the right

418
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,958
way

419
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,719
but the people are are super excited and

420
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,719
the legislature is a little different

421
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,800
than than it is here colombia is pretty

422
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,879
much export only at this point which is

423
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,519
an interesting business model but they

424
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,919
they only export to canada and germany

425
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
which you wouldn't think are the main

426
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,278
places but germany has different

427
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,360
pharmacies where they can basically make

428
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,278
their own concoctions there so whatever

429
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,600
they bring in for material they can then

430
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,000
make a cannabis pill or make gummies in

431
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,720
germany but even germany their cannabis

432
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,320
legislation isn't isn't there either so

433
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,040
it's like everyone's kind of chasing the

434
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,320
tale of the next thing to happen and

435
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,879
we're doing the same thing in the states

436
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,800
too but it is cool to see people

437
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,159
passionate and hungry for knowledge in

438
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,000
these countries

439
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,078
for sure yeah i'm interested to see the

440
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,278
global cannabis coalition and i don't

441
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,759
know if i just coined something that

442
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,078
doesn't exist yet

443
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,958
but that's what we need to see is you

444
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,719
know lawmakers from every country from

445
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,599
every state especially that's legal

446
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,759
medical or recreational coming together

447
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,560
to share a voice

448
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,919
on a world scale to talk about how to

449
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,559
get past

450
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,399
the past 100 years of

451
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,719
demonization of one of the most

452
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,759
effective healing plants on the planet

453
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,879
true that

454
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,480
yeah

455
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,320
i wish that we had

456
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,480
50 states that were actually united and

457
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,920
we could actually work together

458
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,440
to make something like that happen but

459
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,679
we're so segregated as a country it

460
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,040
makes it difficult to see

461
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,559
how that's actually going to work out

462
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,919
you know the progress has been slow

463
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,518
we've been saying that i'm sure there's

464
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,679
people in the 60s that never thought

465
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,440
that they would be here today to see

466
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,000
this you know where it's at

467
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,600
you know it's a it is slow but like you

468
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,440
know i think it was our second or third

469
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,959
episode of royal grand radio

470
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,480
where we had a guest on that was born

471
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,919
and raised in virginia

472
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,680
and i think we made a comment that

473
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,559
virginia would probably be the last

474
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,919
state of the 50 to go legal and boy do i

475
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,439
feel like a dumb ass because i'm pretty

476
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,679
sure i'm the one that said that

477
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,440
yeah here we are like mississippi's on

478
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,838
the very dragon absolutely is another

479
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,600
that would who would have ever imagined

480
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,199
no absolutely

481
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,759
you know when you think about these you

482
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,479
know deeply entrenched you know original

483
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,278
colonies with virginia you know

484
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,800
there's some old boys mentality there

485
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,039
and it's nice to see

486
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,078
that emerging into change but we just

487
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,000
gotta

488
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,319
get the neighbors down in north carolina

489
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and over in tennessee and kind of

490
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,600
get them to see the benefits that it

491
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,480
brings to the community

492
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,120
yeah i mean through the 90s uh

493
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,079
eastern or western carolina eastern

494
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,159
kentucky and and eastern tennessee were

495
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,639
you know their own sort of emerald

496
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,199
triangle in the appalachians so it would

497
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,360
be nice to uh to get to play at some

498
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,360
point yeah let's like get the hills of

499
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,038
kentucky into producing cannabis again

500
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,279
because that's you know been a hotbed of

501
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,679
homes

502
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,959
moonshiners and cannabis growers it goes

503
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,959
hand in hand

504
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,880
you know those the government hill

505
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,279
people yeah be a good special on the

506
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,120
discovery channel yeah yeah right

507
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,200
exactly it'll be on one day

508
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,359
i assure you i'd be feel more fascinated

509
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,919
to see how the hemp verse cannabis plays

510
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,678
out in places like that because i know

511
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,440
there are places humble being one of

512
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,038
them where they put the kibosh down on

513
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
any kind of hemp growing because the

514
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,000
cannabis market itself is so

515
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
strong

516
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,319
and you know there's a lot of fear of

517
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,279
their you know contamination which is

518
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,918
yeah

519
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,240
in in our market um

520
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,720
you know nobody nobody's growing seeded

521
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,759
him uh everybody's growing seedless

522
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,558
female

523
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,319
either

524
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,160
you know feminized genetics i think some

525
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,558
of the strongest feminized genetics out

526
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,360
there are in the hemp industry i've

527
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:08,079
grown four years consecutively with no

528
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,038
hermaphrodites or males and uh

529
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,439
and like

530
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,960
you know that is that is super

531
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,519
impressive so

532
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,079
um you know these two markets you know

533
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,240
that's going at a scale thing and then

534
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,319
and then you know our our side of the

535
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,400
industry is more more of a fine-tuned

536
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,639
craft thing but you know we're making

537
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,280
great strides with the capability to do

538
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,759
acres and acres of feminized seed and

539
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,918
auto flower stuff and just get the data

540
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:37,200
and research and and fine-tune

541
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,120
consistency and genetics so

542
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,679
so yeah i mean i'm excited about the

543
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:44,399
fiber market but um but you know if that

544
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,360
was ever to explode uh we would we would

545
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,160
need uh decoration facilities within 20

546
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:53,279
miles of each fiber farm to make it you

547
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,279
know logistically or or production

548
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,359
abilities make sense so

549
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,160
so i i don't foresee that until there's

550
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:03,759
a big movement of you know subsidies or

551
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,400
programs to encourage um decortication

552
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,558
and processing facilities for fiber

553
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,038
i think that's still a ways away but

554
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,279
that is truly exciting as well and i

555
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,640
think it'll have to be you know regions

556
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,839
go after that and other regions go after

557
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,200
female flowers or or you know like

558
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:25,279
oregon cbd is light years above people

559
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,880
in genetics they've created genetics

560
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,879
that uh will not will not pollinate

561
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,200
and oh wow you know even if there's a

562
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,000
seeded out farm you know that they are

563
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,840
making strides into you know where open

564
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,679
pollination is not even a threat so it's

565
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,798
sterile females essentially essentially

566
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,798
yes wow that's very cool

567
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,480
and i like what you said about you know

568
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,839
different markets and different regions

569
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,200
are going to emerge at different rates

570
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,038
and you see like

571
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,600
illinois again and they're starting to

572
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,160
see some traction on decor

573
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,240
decorification and actually processing

574
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,720
the fiber you got the guys at heartland

575
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,558
hemp and klr genetics and

576
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,640
they're really doing a good job of

577
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,279
actually trying to vertically integrate

578
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,440
and it's a slow process but you see them

579
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,480
cultivating large-scale

580
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,600
smokable hemp smokeable cbd flour

581
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,480
essentially

582
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,158
and also going for larger scale fiber

583
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,919
production and i think you're going to

584
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,440
see that sort of model emerging where

585
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,520
they're going to privatize and

586
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,840
vertically integrate for their own

587
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,879
you know processing of fiber in-house so

588
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,918
they can farm on site process on-site

589
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,159
and move directly ideally to an on-site

590
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,679
or neighboring fiber processing or

591
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,320
textile

592
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,400
facility to actually produce wares from

593
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,519
the fibers but you're right it's got to

594
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,960
be so local to make it cost effective

595
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,400
this is a hemp shirt i wouldn't wear

596
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
hemp stuff every day you know i want to

597
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,159
wear cannabis clothes you know well they

598
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,759
actually are making really fine hemp

599
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,840
clothing yeah we were talking about that

600
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,440
in the past episode where for years we

601
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,639
all wanted to wear it then you put it on

602
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,640
you're like jesus that looks like a

603
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,480
goofball you know but that's a really

604
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,159
nice finely designed shirt yeah this

605
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,440
patagonia like they're they're killing

606
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,520
it with they got a hemp khakis and hemp

607
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,519
uh nice shirts and stuff see that part

608
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,359
of the industry i feel like is so wide

609
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,200
open i mean there's so much room for

610
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,199
this plant to seriously take over the

611
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,200
planet on such a positive level when

612
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,720
you're dealing with plastics and fuels

613
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
and stuff like that i mean there's so

614
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,319
much potential for this thing to just

615
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,599
completely explode but again like you

616
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,439
were saying sean these are global

617
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:31,439
companies patagonia that's a global

618
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,159
company they're not reliant on us and

619
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,400
so you know tying back to that like are

620
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,640
you seeing the same vigor

621
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,280
down in mexico and colombia for the hemp

622
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,960
industry for sure

623
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,599
down in colombia

624
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,679
the focus has been more on the thc

625
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,480
just for right now they can only really

626
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,798
export extracts so everyone's pushing

627
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,960
for terps and pushing to extract and

628
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,599
then export that but they're importing

629
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,480
him from canada in colombia to make

630
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,839
clothing

631
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
so it's very funny when you look at it

632
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,119
like that yeah like you were just

633
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,038
talking about localization you'll see

634
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,918
that happen more but

635
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,319
part of the the qualm or the

636
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,440
the stopping point is always legislature

637
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,200
you know so

638
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,279
if those things can change like on a

639
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,798
local region in the southeast we'll be

640
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,558
making milling and creating textiles

641
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,400
all in the same place that we're growing

642
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,599
but i think globally that will start to

643
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,240
change too

644
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,240
a lot of their you know the the sparkle

645
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,480
in their eye lights up when with the

646
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,640
hemp side of things when you get into uh

647
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,599
bioremediation of soil

648
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,200
so

649
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:39,279
sucking up toxins uh of over overused

650
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,000
and and over uh

651
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,079
produce farmland and and

652
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,279
and you know just the

653
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,158
the uh

654
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,678
areas of our past that we've uh polluted

655
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,159
some of our farmland areas of the

656
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,320
country so you see a lot of interest in

657
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,159
that down there and

658
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,399
and yeah it's exciting you know a

659
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,919
tropical climate and a south american

660
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,159
climate would be perfect for fiber

661
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,640
production and stuff as well and about

662
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,440
40 percent of the land in mexico is

663
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,080
completely contaminated from herbicide

664
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,759
pesticide and fertilizer use or overuse

665
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,678
so they can't even really grow corn in

666
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,679
the places they were 10 20 years ago

667
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,880
because the land is so fallow

668
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,798
but

669
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,720
to pull up the contaminants starting a

670
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,558
hemp program to bioremediate that soil

671
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,798
you can get 20 to 30 percent of that

672
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,440
land back and then be able to use it for

673
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,679
agriculture again that's huge yeah

674
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,919
it's such an effective bioaccumulator

675
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,919
and you can get rid of a lot of the

676
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,159
the tissue that holds all of those

677
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,000
toxins and still use the fiber and still

678
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,799
use some of that plant in an effective

679
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,960
way

680
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,158
remediate the land grow something of

681
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,240
value

682
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,200
and actually move

683
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,679
forward in you know a conscious way to

684
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,159
improve the land again i think that's

685
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,600
insane and fantastic and we've got to

686
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,039
spread the word about this sort of thing

687
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,158
yeah and like all of us standing in this

688
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,440
room that's

689
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,360
kind of where we started with the

690
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,720
industry you know maybe we started

691
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,359
growing weed because we like to smoke

692
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,120
weed but at the same time there's always

693
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,798
that connection between the earth and

694
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,239
the plant and yourself

695
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,720
we we didn't start growing weed to make

696
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,640
money maybe but you know that was just

697
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,960
an added bonus it was a quick second

698
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,240
yeah for sure for sure but the whole the

699
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,480
whole point of having ranchers up and

700
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,159
humble and being out in the woods and

701
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,599
living in a tent and being connected

702
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,600
with the plant was because that was the

703
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,719
experience we wanted we didn't want to

704
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,158
just rip up the land plant in the ground

705
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,679
and then

706
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,600
maybe not grow there again two years

707
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,440
later because it's destroyed you know

708
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,119
yeah it wasn't out of convenience or

709
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,159
wanting to live in a lap of luxury like

710
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,918
you said

711
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,360
you're living in tents on the side of

712
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,640
mountains

713
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,240
far from

714
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,840
actual goods

715
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,400
water sources you're pulling from

716
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:50,000
springs and having to check your water

717
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,320
lines every day and like really living

718
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,319
in the land off the land in the middle

719
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,558
of nowhere so many of these people built

720
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:59,200
from the ground up with empty 40 acre

721
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,720
parcels with just an old logging road

722
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,519
and we had to learn how to cut wood and

723
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,200
build water boxes and you know trap you

724
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,359
know pests and rodents i mean you have

725
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,038
to learn everything from from the ground

726
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,199
up to be able to pull this off

727
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,038
successfully and it wasn't living in the

728
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,600
lap of luxury like we weren't all

729
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,038
cannibis ballers kicking our feet up on

730
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,798
the side of the hot tub watching the

731
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,200
plants grow that's not at all what it

732
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,599
looks like definitely not definitely not

733
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,400
yeah quite the opposite yeah you know

734
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,959
sustain sustainability and the focus

735
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,200
on getting there is you know what drives

736
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,600
a lot of us uh royal gold with the

737
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,240
sustainable media and then hydroponic

738
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,759
cultivation i think that is one fuel

739
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,839
that's always going to continue to burn

740
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,919
in this industry and and keep the fire

741
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,918
going because uh you know it gives us

742
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,640
all purpose to continue to better

743
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,120
ourselves so 100 and like what cutting

744
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,960
edge is doing to innovate more organic

745
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,119
liquid fertilizers for hydroponic

746
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,038
applications and you know using

747
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,599
sustainable mediums like cocoa to kind

748
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,000
of create a balance of

749
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,079
this is a soil type cultivation process

750
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,558
but it's all hydroponic we're doing all

751
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,079
we can to minimize our water consumption

752
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,720
to minimize

753
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,639
water contamination nutrient runoff

754
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,960
nutrient outflow we want the plant to

755
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,960
consume everything we're putting into it

756
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,640
and not be wasting any of these

757
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,319
resources so

758
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,640
yeah and we you know we've been

759
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,158
preaching foliar applications of organic

760
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,559
additives for

761
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,360
20 years now and it's

762
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,038
finally catching on finally the people

763
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,359
are starting to understand that plant

764
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,759
takes 80 to 200 times as much nutrition

765
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,759
through the stomata and you know that

766
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,599
keeps your reservoir clean

767
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,798
the plants getting available nutrients

768
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,399
you can add organics in you know

769
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,798
you know every day we're making waves

770
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,600
and it's nice to see some of these

771
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,839
techniques catching on in commercial

772
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,439
application scenes man i feel like we

773
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,519
could go on all day

774
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,960
um we've got another little while here
