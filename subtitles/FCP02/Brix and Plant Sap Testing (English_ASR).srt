1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
i first wanted to start out by letting

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,839
all the viewers know

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,039
about you know bricks because there's

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,759
i used to test bricks with a

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,079
refractometer

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,320
um at home and what i would do is i

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,399
would eviscerate all of the plant

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
material and then i would squeeze

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,118
usually using something like a garlic

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,000
press

11
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:24,320
the juice on the refractometer to get a

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
bricks measurement now

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
that was something that i advocated and

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
i had also

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,640
you know before i before i knew you know

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,719
a long time ago you know i would say hey

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
if you can because the information out

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,920
there was that if you can get your

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,519
bricks percentage above a certain

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,559
percent

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,120
that plant sucking insects

22
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,640
would no longer see your plant as a food

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,000
source

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
now

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,799
we know

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,000
you know that this is actually an

27
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:57,759
incorrect mode of thinking and an

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,640
incorrect approach to the science

29
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,479
yes

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
yes uh

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:07,359
you know bricks is just a sum it's it's

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,478
a it's the sum of x plus y equals z it's

33
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,438
z

34
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,519
so

35
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:15,039
unless you understand what you're

36
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,280
what you're adding up to create the sum

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,360
um it's pretty difficult

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,118
to make a statement to say if your

39
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,719
sum if your bricks equal a certain

40
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,879
number that it equals uh

41
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,679
healthy plants or

42
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,319
decreased pests if you don't know your

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,400
ingredients if you don't know what's

44
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,359
making up those brick

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
so

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,920
for example

47
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,798
same with total nitrogen um you can get

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
your total nitrogen number and

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,520
go wow i've got some really good

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,159
nitrogen what is what is in your total

51
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:57,118
nitrogen again that's just a sum x plus

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,920
y equals z total nitrogen is the z

53
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,319
what makes up if it's just

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,359
mainly all nitrate that's not being

55
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,318
broken down and that is the main

56
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,878
ingredient in your total nitrogen then

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,878
no your your total nitrogen number is

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:17,359
not good even if it's falling into the

59
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:21,840
adequate ranges adequate

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,840
you know category so efficient

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,759
looking back at brick you know there's a

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,439
lot of things that can

63
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:32,399
increase your bricks um to give it that

64
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:35,359
high bricks but um

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,800
the number does not

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
account for or equate

67
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,599
healthy

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,800
so for instance

69
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:47,119
chloride and cannabis is a chloride

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,719
accumulator it does a great job of it

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,920
it's very good at

72
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,840
accumulating it if you have

73
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:55,518
significantly high chloride that can

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
your bricks

75
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,319
and then you will have a high brix

76
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,639
number but that doesn't necessarily mean

77
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,598
you have healthy plants or they're going

78
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,199
to be um

79
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,039
they're going to be

80
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,679
decreasing pests

81
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,400
things of that

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,280
another thing that is a accumulatory

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,080
right is if you were to look at your

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,360
cation exchange if you just looked at

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,200
the number and not looked at the cations

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,920
the positively charged elements that

87
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,238
make up the cation exchange

88
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:34,079
that that number means nothing i mean

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,280
you you could have um a ton of potassium

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,959
equating your cation exchange and then

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,120
what does that do for you that that does

92
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,400
not you're just looking at your cation

93
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,719
exchange you have to look at all the

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,280
cations in it right that's

95
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:51,120
again another sum number

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,000
so when people equate bricks

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,080
has the same definition no matter if

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,158
you're looking at say grapes like a

99
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,640
berry like a grape or you're looking at

100
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,759
leaves it's the same definition

101
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,679
it it's

102
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,318
soluble solids

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,159
so the definition doesn't change but

104
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:12,318
what you're measuring does so in grapes

105
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,479
most of your soluble solids when

106
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,199
measuring bricks is sugar

107
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,238
but when measuring leaves that's a

108
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,360
completely different story that is

109
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,839
that is a growing photosynthetic

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,400
part of the plant there will be sugars

111
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,478
in there of course absolutely

112
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,159
there could be a ton of other things in

113
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,478
there as well

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,560
and that and that brings me to the ref

115
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,719
the refractometer for people who are

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,519
trying to get bricks numbers

117
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,880
at home using

118
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,359
an instrument that's usually meant for

119
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,040
alcohol to measure the

120
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,680
brix levels to see how you know the

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,639
potential of what's convertible

122
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,199
into

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,879
another compound

124
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,720
when you miss a uh eviscerate

125
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:05,918
leaf material you're not getting just

126
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,000
you know what is available as far as

127
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,758
what's in the plant which would be you

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,079
know your what what substances would

129
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,919
that would occur in the the phloem and

130
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,159
xylem of the plant

131
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,879
right you're getting

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,120
the chlorophyll you're getting all of

133
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,680
the vacuole fluids you're getting all

134
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,000
the fluid that's encapsulated in cell

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
membranes so

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,240
you're also getting things

137
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,758
that have already been complexed and

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,918
stored

139
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,199
and when those are broken down

140
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,680
via

141
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,080
you know a maceration

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,038
you get all of that stuff and so when

143
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,519
you're

144
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,839
squeezing this green pigmented liquid

145
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,079
onto a refractometer to try to take

146
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,679
bricks reading what you're essentially

147
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,800
doing is

148
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,800
you're getting a collective sum

149
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,120
of

150
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,038
everything that's in that tissue

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,478
potentially

152
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,240
and you can't

153
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,758
determine

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,519
what

155
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,400
what it is that way right you can't

156
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,478
determine what you can't separate out

157
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,758
it's not a true brix reading because a

158
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,199
lot of the stuff that would be

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,639
considered bricks like sugar content or

160
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,639
the nutritional content

161
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,799
is there's so much more in there there's

162
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,360
so much contaminants in that so it

163
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,280
doesn't even equate to an accurate piece

164
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,639
of data

165
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,318
um

166
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,280
i mean i am going to do a little plug

167
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,720
for new age here this is exactly why

168
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,879
in sap analysis do bricks and sugar to

169
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,080
give you an understanding

170
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:46,319
of what part of the bricks is the sugar

171
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,318
or if your sugar is too low

172
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,879
what is making your bricks high why are

173
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,520
your bricks high well let's go and look

174
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,000
at the nutrients that are out of balance

175
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,000
um that's why stop analysis is so

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,720
helpful in

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,720
looking at especially bricks and

178
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,400
understanding what's

179
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,639
what are the ingredients of it what are

180
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,758
you measuring if your major is your if

181
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,879
you're measuring a whole bunch of

182
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,759
chloride

183
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,519
um

184
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,479
probably want to know that if you're

185
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,240
measuring

186
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,758
sodium you're probably

187
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,840
possible absolutely if you're in ground

188
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,759
and you've litified your water and your

189
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,519
aluminum is off the chart you probably

190
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
want to know that as well

191
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,639
um

192
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,879
there's a whole bunch of things like you

193
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,280
just said when you're men

194
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,639
the um the leaf

195
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:37,359
that you're throwing in at ingredients

196
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,280
that are definitely not in the fruit

197
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,759
um that wouldn't be found in the fruit

198
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,719
or at very very low quantities

199
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,598
um

200
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,599
so

201
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,719
it's the same definition

202
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,240
absolutely this definition it's just it

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
means different things when you're

204
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,598
measuring

205
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,479
uh different parts of the plant

206
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:59,038
i mean you can equate bricks if you were

207
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,038
measuring roots

208
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,959
of the roots you can squeeze roots we've

209
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,680
done it before

210
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,198
berries but you wouldn't equate the two

211
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,120
they're completely different parts of

212
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,598
the plants

213
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,360
so then you have to make a data set for

214
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,560
that too i want to back up and say you

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,080
know what you can still use a

216
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,319
refractometer because it's a data point

217
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,000
but you need to understand

218
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,280
you know how to apply that data point

219
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,800
because that data point isn't going to

220
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,679
be the same

221
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,720
as what you would do with a bricks

222
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,560
analysis from new age labs right it's

223
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,479
not going to work that way it's going to

224
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,679
be a different data set that's not going

225
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,519
to necessarily correlate to what you're

226
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,319
getting from the lab like you might be

227
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,320
able to use that for your own

228
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,839
you know baseline if you're creating a

229
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,920
data set right where you're creating a

230
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,080
standard across the board and you use

231
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,079
that in conjunction with these other

232
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,879
data points then

233
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,879
you have an applicable resource but

234
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,879
however if you're just

235
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,639
if you're using it to say hey my plants

236
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,000
are going to be immune to pest pressure

237
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,958
at

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,958
if i get a reading on

239
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,759
a meter like you said because you don't

240
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,399
know

241
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,200
what those are you don't know what's in

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,958
that

243
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,879
and that's why the sap analysis for me

244
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,479
is so interesting

245
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,039
one of the things that we've talked to

246
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,360
about in the past is

247
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,079
what you just mentioned the bricks

248
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,639
versus the total sugars right because

249
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,759
you know that if this much of the sugar

250
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:34,319
content is the bricks then you know that

251
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,600
the rest of that percentage is going to

252
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,200
be

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,159
the mineral content the mineral

254
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,640
nutritional content right that's stored

255
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,240
right that's available right

256
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,159
and if you have

257
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,200
really high potassium

258
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:52,000
high nitrogen high chlorides high sodium

259
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,480
that's going into the bricks

260
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that's the other part of the bricks

261
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,320
also if you are

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,799
using a refractometer at home in the

263
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,440
field you need to use the same source of

264
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,759
light every time don't do it some of it

265
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,839
inside and some of it outside all needs

266
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,799
to be inside choose um a time of day so

267
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,279
it's

268
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,120
roughly the same lighting if you are

269
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,039
going to be outside if you're going to

270
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,959
be outside

271
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,519
not do it on a sunny day

272
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,518
in a cloudy day you need to do it

273
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,360
in in the same type of light

274
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,480
that's the one thing about the science

275
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,959
is you have to be consistent in them and

276
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,480
because if you have variables while

277
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,199
you're collecting data

278
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,680
those variables can essentially change

279
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,000
your outcomes you are collecting leaves

280
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,799
and you're an outdoor grower um collect

281
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,519
all your leaves on the sunny side

282
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,719
um or all of them on the shady side but

283
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
don't

284
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,440
do one or the other because you really

285
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:54,639
want to understand how your

286
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,200
um plant is photosynthesizing and for

287
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,439
stop analysis that it's all on the sunny

288
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,320
side but sometimes plants cannabis

289
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,240
plants can get very large so if you are

290
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,959
collecting and you're doing

291
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,320
at home or in your greenhouse or or

292
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,879
somewhere

293
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
consistency i just can't even tell you

294
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,480
is the key

295
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,799
um if you're going to be watering every

296
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,759
other day then take your leaves and take

297
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,159
your samples um either before or after

298
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:25,120
your water and always do it in that

299
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:28,240
manner always take it in the morning

300
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,000
always apply the same pressure so that's

301
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
really hard if you're going to be using

302
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,159
a garlic press

303
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,800
don't have all of the people that work

304
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,199
for you try to use it on a different day

305
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,278
have one or two people or do it yourself

306
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
and try to maintain the same amount of

307
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,399
pressure maybe put a cardboard or

308
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,559
something in it that you can try to

309
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,320
monitor the amount of pressure so are

310
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,159
you going to break the vacuoles every

311
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,040
time or you're not going to break the

312
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,120
everything so there's all

313
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,278
things to think about when you are

314
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,039
collecting your own data that come into

315
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:03,039
play even just collecting

316
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,278
yeah and so

317
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,319
when we're talking about

318
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:11,200
um having high bricks on

319
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,399
a sap analysis now i know that brix

320
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,200
levels change throughout the day

321
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,639
um depending on you know what's going on

322
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,360
if there's more light less light

323
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,360
lighting has a lot to do with it

324
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,039
environmental factors like temperature

325
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,480
and humidity

326
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,319
and also

327
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,759
what's in the soil you know what is

328
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,760
available to the plant so

329
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,639
when we're looking at a sap analysis and

330
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,278
we're looking at bricks versus total

331
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,879
sugars and then

332
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,039
you know the

333
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,278
the nutrition

334
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,639
what is one of the things that we should

335
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,078
always be

336
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,919
mindful of when it comes to sugar

337
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,919
content versus brix levels

338
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,479
in a sap analysis

339
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,480
and you've taken a young fully developed

340
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,680
photosynthetic leave and an old yet

341
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,360
viably

342
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,919
your

343
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,639
young and old leaf pairing your sugar

344
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,799
should always be equal to but really

345
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
higher in the new leaves

346
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,159
always

347
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,879
if that is not the case there's a

348
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,639
photosynthetic problem

349
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,159
so if your

350
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,759
sugars are

351
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,120
lower

352
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,360
in the new leaves which means they're

353
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,440
higher in the old and you have a high

354
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,039
bricks that means photosynthetic

355
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
broken somewhere

356
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,919
and your bricks

357
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,040
are being made up of something

358
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,559
and so in that type of situation where

359
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,799
you're seeing

360
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,518
happens a lot quite a bit

361
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,359
it's

362
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,879
that's why i wanted to touch on it you

363
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,278
know because

364
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,120
when you see this type of interaction

365
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,559
taking place

366
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,600
you can

367
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,000
you can go to a certain mode of thinking

368
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,639
and say okay well

369
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,720
something's not photosynthesizing why

370
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,919
are we lacking photosynthesis and you

371
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,680
can go to the

372
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,958
my immediate thinking is going to the

373
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,799
first five photosynthetic nutrients and

374
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,000
so we look at those we look at those

375
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,319
first and we say okay how how does our

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,360
nitrogen look how is the nitrogen

377
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,519
stimulation going do we have

378
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
things like molybdenum are they

379
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,679
completely gone we're looking at

380
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,360
molybdenum on the test too because i

381
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,239
think that's another indicator if you

382
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,919
have high molybdenum it means that

383
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,919
there's

384
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,958
a there's a gap

385
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,479
in the metabolic process an enzymatic

386
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,319
process that's happening with the

387
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,079
reduction

388
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,680
of

389
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,879
nitrate

390
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:53,759
ammonium into nitrate

391
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,120
um we're looking at the iron right

392
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,399
because that's another photosynthetic

393
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,759
chemical we're looking at magnesium

394
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,440
magnesium

395
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,159
you're looking at sulfur

396
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,480
um to make chlorophyll so if you're low

397
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,838
on mag you can just stop the train right

398
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,000
there

399
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,880
yeah

400
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,919
and four nitrogen equals a chlorophyll

401
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,480
so

402
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,278
that's the game that's how that's played

403
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,159
and if you are missing your mag and you

404
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,439
have a whole bunch of nitrogen um

405
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,600
that's going to be

406
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,040
that nitrogen to cycle through and of

407
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,278
course very hard

408
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,240
and then it and then what happens on the

409
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,399
on the

410
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,600
sap test is you see

411
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,320
that nitrogen go higher right it builds

412
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,159
up

413
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,278
because it's not able to convert

414
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:46,000
the

415
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:47,198
so we see the nitrate or ammonium go

416
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,039
higher

417
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,120
not the total because when we're looking

418
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,198
at the total nitrogen that could be

419
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,879
amino acids and proteins the nitrogen

420
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,879
complexes that are

421
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,639
stored inside of the plant right

422
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,759
anything that has a nitrogen molecule

423
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,198
attached to it shows as total nitrogen

424
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,680
and then we're looking at ammonium and

425
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,399
nitrogen nitrate we're looking at you

426
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,159
know

427
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,919
ammonium

428
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,719
nitrate is reduced

429
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:15,759
into ammonium and then

430
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,800
if those are building up in tissue and

431
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,320
we have a low accumulation of total

432
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,679
nitrogen

433
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,560
what do you think that usually indicates

434
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,838
um

435
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,479
that

436
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,240
indicates that your nitrogen is not

437
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,879
being broken down so it's being taken up

438
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,720
as nitrate and ammonium

439
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,600
and then it's not being broken down

440
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,079
going in down the um

441
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,680
nitrogen reductase pathway into amino

442
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:44,799
acids and what you really want is

443
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,159
proteins

444
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,958
so when that occurs i

445
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,000
so

446
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,359
magnesium has to be there if it's not

447
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
then

448
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,560
you've figured it out that's that's easy

449
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,919
um what you also need what you already

450
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,359
said you need molly you need iron

451
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,359
um iron

452
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,599
can be rather difficult to get into the

453
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,318
plants and many times that's kind of

454
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,958
picking points especially in veg because

455
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,199
the plant is creating structure

456
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,679
and um

457
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,038
so much of the iron is used in the

458
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,199
nitrogen reductase pathway at that time

459
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,038
you're growing your plants so what does

460
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,759
that mean you always have to replenish

461
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:30,640
it unless you're growing and you have

462
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,240
great um microbial

463
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,360
uh

464
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,038
pathways going on in your soil and

465
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,759
you're able to

466
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,079
take up the iron if you're in ground um

467
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:45,038
iron is usually always there but it's in

468
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:48,159
the wrong form so usually it's usually

469
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:50,079
as in it's usually as an iron oxide

470
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,919
right and the same thing with manganese

471
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,000
which is another

472
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,120
um

473
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,279
i think you said it was the king of

474
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:02,079
micronutrients right

475
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,079
i'm micronutrients for sure if you are

476
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,839
getting adequate iron and adequate

477
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,000
manganese and you're getting them up

478
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,839
through your roots and your ground it

479
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,038
usually means

480
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,279
that you have uh really good soil

481
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,960
microbes or you're using a product

482
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,798
that's heavily chelated and it's

483
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,558
actually getting into the plant those

484
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,359
are the two ways of

485
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,519
getting

486
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,519
to

487
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,080
and iron's really tricky especially in

488
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,959
these peat based modified mix

489
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,918
mixes because of the fact that

490
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,400
when we're looking at oxidation

491
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,480
chemistry for iron

492
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,519
it usually falls

493
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,919
into an unavailable state at the ph

494
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,879
ranges that we're cultivating these

495
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,360
plants in as soon as it hits moisture or

496
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,520
it comes in contact with oxygen it

497
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,000
oxidizes and so it becomes unavailable

498
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,839
very very quickly so being able to have

499
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,160
like you said uh something that can

500
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,959
chelate these the the iron and keep it

501
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,200
in reduced form or if you can get a

502
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,038
specific set of microorganisms one of

503
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,240
the things that

504
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,200
i see though is the type of

505
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,079
microorganisms that you would need to

506
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,000
keep iron reduced are are reductive

507
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,720
microorganisms and these are usually

508
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,400
focused or anaerobic organisms and

509
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
because what they're doing is they're

510
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
con

511
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,038
that

512
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,119
they're

513
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:28,000
able to function in

514
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,759
these really like low or no oxygen

515
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,400
conditions and that's the kind of type

516
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:36,000
of condition that iron needs to stay in

517
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,160
its reduced form to be available however

518
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,919
those conditions don't typically last in

519
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,320
these systems because they're so highly

520
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,960
aerated and because

521
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,960
um they don't stay anaerobic in in a

522
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,079
typical field condition where you have

523
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,038
set like total saturation of soil for a

524
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,519
period of time that stuff does become

525
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,640
available and if you have adequate soil

526
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,519
carbon you're able to kind of keep that

527
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,400
in a chelated form um the humic and

528
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,558
fulvic acid amino chelation through

529
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,120
bacterial secondary metabolite

530
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,440
production those all keep iron in

531
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,599
available forms same as manganese same

532
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,000
as things like phosphate or any of those

533
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,719
minerals that have to be in a reduced

534
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,079
form but as soon as you get more oxygen

535
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,038
as soon as the water starts to evaporate

536
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,119
the soil chemistry completely changes

537
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,440
and the things that are available in a

538
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,639
reduced form become less available and

539
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,400
the things that

540
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,520
are available in a more oxidized form

541
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,519
become more available

542
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,640
got it

543
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,480
that's so

544
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,320
so

545
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,558
hurdle

546
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,119
just because just because

547
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:52,079
a zap analysis tell you that you're low

548
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:55,279
on iron and manganese it's

549
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,199
that's just fool correct now it's the

550
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,240
grower that needs to figure out how to

551
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,880
get it in

552
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,960
yeah and that's where we use the science

553
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,120
we can look at science but we have to be

554
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,600
able to figure out how to apply it again

555
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,359
i'm a big proponent for the humic and

556
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,240
fulvic acids

557
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,240
but

558
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,720
one thing that i've been really diving

559
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,599
into is soil carbon as a nutrient that

560
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,640
plays a integral role

561
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,558
in things like uh

562
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,080
carbon phosphate clustering that's

563
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,279
something i'm learning about going down

564
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,119
some rabbit holes i'm going to be going

565
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,480
out to chicago

566
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,199
next week

567
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,120
i'm going to be learning some stuff from

568
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,759
somebody who was a private consultant

569
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,599
for nasa

570
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,200
and

571
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,480
he's going to he you know

572
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
gonna

573
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,599
show me some interesting things that i

574
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,798
don't think a lot of people know yet but

575
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:56,719
what i'm seeing from doing some r d is

576
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:59,200
soil carbon plays a huge role in

577
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,159
keeping things in

578
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,840
uh chemically available forms for the

579
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,120
plant

580
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,359
and so

581
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,119
one of the things that i'm wondering is

582
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,519
can we use

583
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,319
you know sap analysis

584
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,319
can we see

585
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,759
all right it's not just step analysis

586
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,880
can we use soil testing as well to

587
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,038
get a

588
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,480
better understanding of

589
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:30,158
how the carbon is affecting the dynamic

590
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,159
of the chemistry in the soil

591
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,480
well

592
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,558
the answer is yes you have to know what

593
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,519
you're measuring so

594
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,720
you know you measure low carbon high

595
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,119
carbon

596
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,360
soils and plant uptake

597
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,439
always have something to

598
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,038
um compare it to

599
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,320
that's really you're gonna where the

600
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,759
triangle is the delta the change

601
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,439
that's really

602
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,759
what you're looking for

603
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,640
yeah at that point

604
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,558
so

605
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,400
you know the whole we are you know we

606
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,960
got way off topic and we were talking

607
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,679
about bricks one of the things that is

608
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,319
really common is

609
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,440
pest and insect pressure and the belief

610
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,399
is if you

611
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,919
if your plants are at a certain

612
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,919
percentage of

613
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,038
bricks and it's really hard to you know

614
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,359
beast

615
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:30,000
give a complete definitive answer i

616
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:33,038
think because

617
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,720
bricks as com as measuring just the

618
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:39,119
sugar content or bricks measuring

619
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,079
the the total nitrogen

620
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,879
content because i know that

621
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,319
nitrogen and the types of nitrogen do

622
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,360
play a role

623
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,879
in

624
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:54,558
um insect sucking pests what's what's

625
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,559
kind of your take on

626
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,480
the the role of both nitrogen and then

627
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,400
complexed

628
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,240
carbohydrates and sugars that are stored

629
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,038
in the plant

630
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,319
uh

631
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,798
and insect pressure do you have you seen

632
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,960
a lot of data that

633
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,119
you know that that correlates those

634
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,038
things

635
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,519
so you know i've been doing actually a

636
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,919
lot of research on that um i'll be

637
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,440
speaking about that

638
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,360
based on the research i've been doing

639
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,798
later on this winter

640
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,959
um it's not a one one size fits all that

641
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,798
everybody likes to have

642
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,640
black and white statements really

643
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,639
there's there's a whole

644
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,360
whole gamut of things that needs to fall

645
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,720
in place which is why plants are so cool

646
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,839
but um

647
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,798
yes

648
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,599
virgin is not breaking down if it's in

649
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:53,038
nitrate high nitrate and

650
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:57,439
high total and or high ammonium than

651
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,440
the nitrate portion and

652
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,519
tests

653
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,200
but that isn't

654
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,679
a number because

655
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,759
high nitrate and high ammonium is going

656
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,480
to be different for everybody because

657
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,759
it's based on the difference compared to

658
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
your total n

659
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,640
so you can't just throw out at 500 parts

660
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,319
per million of nitrate because if you

661
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,559
have 2 000 parts per million of total n

662
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,599
well that's 75 percent conversion you're

663
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:28,000
doing okay but if you have

664
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,399
a thousand parts per million of total

665
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,519
and now you're 50 conversion now that's

666
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,080
a problem

667
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,519
but maybe your plants are older maybe

668
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,678
they're younger maybe there's a

669
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,278
different uh maybe you're

670
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,440
you're throwing in all kinds of curve

671
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,240
balls so there's not really a center

672
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,840
that i say that if your nitrate is at

673
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,278
this number you're going to have

674
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,000
problems you do

675
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,919
have to compare it to your total n which

676
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,599
means every grower is going to be

677
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,840
different

678
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,879
also

679
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,879
for for sugars i've been doing quite a

680
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,840
bit of research i've done

681
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,720
one

682
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,519
um research project on its own

683
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,519
and came

684
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,798
in results again that i will be sharing

685
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,080
and i'm looking into how

686
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:18,000
um manganese works in to

687
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,199
the system about

688
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,119
um

689
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,600
sugar reduction and looking into your

690
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,719
different types of sugars so it's not

691
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,558
only

692
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,519
high sugar but what types of sugars

693
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,639
um

694
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,759
so manganese does come into play there

695
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,080
as well

696
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,879
and really what i have seen

697
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,599
that

698
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,120
probably makes the biggest difference is

699
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,158
to start

700
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,798
early

701
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,120
if you're going to plant plug plants or

702
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,400
you're going to be planting plants with

703
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,678
roots

704
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,559
start them

705
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,519
early don't hit them with a whole bunch

706
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,759
of fertilizer as they get older give

707
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,240
them the nutrients that they need

708
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,359
now those are the plants that i see have

709
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,440
less bugs left less aphid people did

710
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,959
root dips they started early they

711
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,080
started right as the plant was forming

712
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,640
and that's

713
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,759
that's what i did i had

714
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,559
i had lettuce i had plug plants and i

715
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,798
did micronutrient root dips and there

716
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,440
was one set

717
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,278
in my uh that i did i i did the whole

718
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,120
experiment by myself

719
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:31,278
um did it in triplicate there was one

720
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,798
one part of the experiment that had no

721
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:39,038
aphids that was right next to a

722
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:41,759
multitude of plants that had stopped

723
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,919
and why was that and the one major

724
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,278
difference in all the sap analysis was

725
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,759
manganese

726
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,240
and it's not just administ because i

727
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,200
added manganese everything i added it to

728
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,278
everything

729
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,080
but the one thing that really really

730
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,919
shined the plants that got the manga

731
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,759
through the roots that was able to be

732
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,120
chelated and taken up when the plants

733
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,798
were young

734
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,959
those are the plants that didn't have

735
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,839
aphids everybody got

736
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,079
is

737
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,398
you know on their life cycle they got

738
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,119
foliar they didn't want to kill it

739
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:15,278
but it was starting early and that's the

740
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,278
plant signed and they were right next to

741
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,839
the plants that were covered in aphids

742
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,240
and i i looked

743
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,000
out um

744
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,679
all the way through the whole entire

745
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,119
research

746
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,880
one set

747
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,158
of study plants

748
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,840
had one to two aphids and mainly zero on

749
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,520
on plants right next to that were

750
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,918
crawling with aphids

751
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,119
and that's what i found out mayonnaise

752
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,960
is magic i think the way you apply it

753
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,000
and i think it's early on

754
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,720
you don't not wait until there's a

755
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,200
deficiency you add it up front

756
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,038
yes uh you want manganese kind of

757
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,798
throughout and one of the benefits of

758
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,640
manganese is that

759
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,319
so manganese again is tricky right

760
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,679
because it needs to be in a reduced form

761
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,960
and it causes it in it and it creates uh

762
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,519
you know

763
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,480
manganese oxides

764
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,879
in soil that are unavailable and it also

765
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,278
competes with iron yep

766
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,039
so one of the things is trying to be

767
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,640
able to get these inadequate quantities

768
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:18,480
inside of the plant can be difficult

769
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,880
because you're dealing with the soil

770
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,360
chemistry so high organic matter

771
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,360
actually

772
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,919
inhibits manganese uptake because it it

773
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,558
causes oxidation but there are

774
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,919
beneficial microorganisms specifically

775
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,158
the bacillus and the wrath of

776
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,360
pseudomonas which actually can

777
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,760
keep manganese in an available form can

778
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,918
increase the availability of the

779
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,960
manganese but also what mayonnaise does

780
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,200
too is it increases it it helps

781
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,880
facilitate the uptake of other

782
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,480
micronutrients

783
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,600
is one of the benefits that you get from

784
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,360
the manganese so i i would assume that

785
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,639
it's not the min just the manganese

786
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,479
itself but the

787
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,840
but the but some of the properties and

788
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,120
the benefits that the manganese are

789
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,439
doing inside of the plant being to

790
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,519
help the plant get

791
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,200
the other micronutrients from the soil

792
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,879
which are also going to benefit because

793
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,360
it's going to increase plant defenses

794
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,320
with all those other chemicals that are

795
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:15,599
being

796
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,278
taken out all those other plant

797
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,119
nutrients as well

798
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,398
right

799
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,479
no i

800
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,479
that's what i don't really think when

801
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,880
you ask that question

802
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,440
what do i think about nutrients and what

803
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,840
needs to be applied to decrease your

804
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,798
pest it's not i don't think it's one

805
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,879
nutrient but it's a plan or

806
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:37,839
never seeing it

807
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,320
ever

808
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,639
once you see a deficiency already you've

809
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,599
already lost

810
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,880
how how many i lost time you've lost

811
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,359
time and you've lost sufficiency right

812
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,120
as far as as far as the metabolic and

813
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,719
the internal processes of those plants i

814
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,439
i think that

815
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,919
it's really difficult to always be

816
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,159
especially in a natural setting right in

817
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,080
agronomic conditions it's going to be

818
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,760
even more difficult than in these types

819
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,678
of modified conditions that were

820
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:13,278
operating in cannabis

821
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,640
but still looking at the way that

822
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:19,440
chemistry and biology keep things in

823
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,880
available in unavailable forms and being

824
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,240
able to switch the soil from modes

825
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,760
where

826
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,880
you can go back and forth this is going

827
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,720
to be available this is going to be

828
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,720
available because there's

829
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,480
it's like you know you see those ph

830
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,558
rings people like oh this is the perfect

831
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,200
ph range because this

832
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,720
is more of it this is kind of available

833
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,120
this is more available and you're just

834
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,360
trying to get everything you can but to

835
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:46,398
get maximum sufficiency you need to go

836
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,199
back and forth and back and forth and so

837
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:53,199
you need these type of oxidation and

838
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,919
redox states happening in these mixes

839
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,759
right you need to be able to figure out

840
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,519
how i can do this artificially how would

841
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,519
nature do this

842
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,440
in this environment that we're

843
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,519
creating for this plant and that a lot

844
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,960
of times is going to be through

845
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,480
dropping ph ranges maybe you're using or

846
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,240
um an organic

847
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,200
you know like using the fulvic and humic

848
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,720
acids or using biology that's going to

849
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,319
drop here

850
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,919
and then maybe having

851
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,158
something else that's going to increase

852
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,679
using you know high potassium inputs

853
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,880
that are going to

854
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,679
increase

855
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,919
the the soil ph and

856
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,759
make other things more available adding

857
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,600
carbon that's going to be able to

858
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,960
chelate these things naturally and keep

859
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,798
them uniform

860
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,399
it's really interesting and that's you

861
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,240
know the the

862
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,798
i think the most benefit that we get

863
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,240
from sap analysis is that it gives so

864
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:47,440
many data points but it also lets us

865
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,960
preemptively come out a problem because

866
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,120
if we know that

867
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,679
something is pulling from a lower

868
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:56,398
portion of the plant then we get to

869
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,240
address that before it actually shows

870
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,599
visual symptoms

871
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,720
and i think that's one of the things

872
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,240
that

873
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,679
a lot of

874
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,558
growers

875
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,720
are usually addressing issues as they

876
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,839
see them come up if you can see the

877
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,240
issue before it's visually

878
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,000
present then you're able to mitigate

879
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,399
some of that stress that's going to be

880
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,720
associated with the efficiency system

881
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:23,918
yep absolutely you're seeing a

882
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,919
deficiency symptom

883
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,799
your plant is

884
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,960
is it's sad

885
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,480
it it's it's gone through weeks and

886
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,759
weeks and weeks of struggling right

887
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,000
that's

888
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,038
that's

889
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,200
how much

890
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:44,319
how much uh sugar

891
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,798
um how much photosynthesis potential

892
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,720
have you lost how much um you want to

893
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,599
have your greatest genetic potential

894
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,798
because um in this crop it's all about

895
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,759
genetics and crossing and varieties so

896
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,278
if you're

897
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,440
if you're

898
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,839
if you're deficient in something

899
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,159
you've lost your greatest genetic

900
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,319
potential of showing it

901
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,079
and now you're just trying to keep pace

902
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:11,358
when you're trying to look at new

903
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,480
varieties and and what they can do and

904
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,519
uh potency when you're deficient you've

905
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,079
lost

906
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,559
the ceiling at that point

907
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,359
you're not going to reach that highest

908
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,398
genetic potential because you've already

909
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,759
you're you're you've brought your

910
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,598
ceiling down

911
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,720
and you know what's really interesting

912
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,838
too is we're looking at

913
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,158
the testing from like commercial

914
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:39,519
standpoint where you can take an

915
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:43,039
analysis of a certain cultivar even if

916
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:45,039
you're only increasing the the

917
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,358
let's say you're getting an increase

918
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:51,199
as a percentage in quality and both

919
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:53,039
yield if those are both only two percent

920
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,878
but you're running thousands and

921
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,599
thousands of plants

922
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,480
that two percent can

923
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:04,559
can be a huge huge

924
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,760
uh difference in potential income

925
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,759
versus

926
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,960
what it would cost to say you know test

927
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,599
uh

928
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,240
do a collective data sample of a test

929
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,320
testing or a collective leaf sample and

930
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,759
send that in

931
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,760
that's one of the biggest things that i

932
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,839
see is especially when you start to

933
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,680
scale these systems

934
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,039
and you want to go bigger and bigger you

935
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,719
have to have

936
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,279
these data sets you have to have these

937
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,319
data sets to maintain quality control to

938
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,760
maintain

939
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,480
uh yield potentials

940
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,680
people are using us um

941
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,199
especially

942
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:45,838
also to decrease their inputs so

943
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:48,799
think of large grows to

944
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,759
your inputs by ten percent especially as

945
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,320
the

946
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,560
sky rocketing the potassium or

947
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,200
phosphorus is skyrocketing those prices

948
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,559
are are real i have growers that are

949
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,519
very concerned

950
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,759
um

951
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:05,119
and this is mainstream ag but still it's

952
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,920
going to trickle down on the differences

953
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,000
um in fertilizer price last year versus

954
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,880
you know 2020.

955
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,599
and if you're over feeding in certain

956
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,079
areas uh they want to know that they

957
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,079
want to have that reduction in 10 so

958
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,079
they can reallocate that budget it

959
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,480
normally goes to the micronutrients

960
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,400
usually if you have an

961
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,440
access

962
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,320
you can

963
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,119
you know stop applying 10 to 15 to 20

964
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,320
percent people reallocate in these two

965
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,720
areas

966
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,400
they reallocate in their micronutrients

967
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,719
first and then they put more money into

968
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,800
their soil biology whether they're

969
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,759
organic sustainable

970
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,400
um

971
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,560
uh conventional it doesn't matter those

972
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,440
are the those are the realms that that

973
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,799
falls

974
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,480
into there and that's

975
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,400
that's one of the the

976
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,559
things that actually got me started into

977
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,160
organic cultivation was

978
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:02,000
the cost-saving benefit but

979
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,879
it's exponentially increased when you

980
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,800
have

981
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,240
especially when you're doing like you

982
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,039
know soil testing saturated paste and

983
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,959
you're doing sap analysis because i can

984
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,719
know hey i don't need to over apply this

985
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,760
these are my target ranges i don't need

986
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:20,000
to go over this it's a waste of money to

987
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,240
add this to the soil because it's not

988
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,838
going to give me any additional input

989
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,799
and i can

990
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:26,719
know

991
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,039
you know pre

992
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,959
you know for me i use all dry mineral

993
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,679
amendments so we can order things and

994
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,880
bolt things cost maybe 15 to 35 dollars

995
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,960
for 50 pound bags we can order them all

996
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,000
at once and have a supply for x amount

997
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,400
of time

998
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,559
add those as we need them we don't need

999
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,800
to there it takes the guessing out of it

1000
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,519
too right there's no guess work involved

1001
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,560
you know hey i need to add some gypsum i

1002
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,559
need some

1003
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,239
you know because calcium is low i need

1004
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,559
to increase calcium or i need to change

1005
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:59,439
the percentage of my cations and i need

1006
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,519
to increase potassium to make sure it's

1007
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,240
above magnesium things like that it's so

1008
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,000
much easier when you have data sets to

1009
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,919
decrease those costs

1010
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,679
absolutely and

1011
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,960
again with this crop with so many

1012
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:15,598
varieties out there um really good to

1013
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,199
have your own data sets right so collect

1014
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,320
your own data

1015
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:21,279
grown

1016
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,200
um strains throughout the whole entire

1017
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,839
because different strains feed

1018
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,879
differently for sure i come from the

1019
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:28,719
baby

1020
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,200
as mother plants very similar to

1021
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,039
cannabis very

1022
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,639
very very similar they cut them they

1023
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:40,000
sell clones same exact situation i've

1024
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:42,000
seen varieties in a trial plot that all

1025
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,639
the same amount of nitrogen and you can

1026
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,358
just see it's like christmas lights

1027
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,519
certain rows are lighting up with

1028
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,519
deficiencies right next to a row that's

1029
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,559
perfectly green and those are things

1030
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:57,119
that you want to know you want to have

1031
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:59,199
beads in the same greenhouse or the same

1032
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,960
plot you don't want running a

1033
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,919
place trying to

1034
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
um

1035
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,039
feed

1036
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,639
very very different strains different

1037
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,039
amount of

1038
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,679
inputs that's yeah that's like running

1039
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,400
around drunk

1040
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:17,199
you know what i've seen it through doing

1041
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,920
the sap analysis that's the best way to

1042
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:22,078
actually look at a specific cultivar's

1043
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,320
nutritional needs because if you have a

1044
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,359
baseline that works pretty much across

1045
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,000
the board

1046
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:30,159
but you see that things like phosphate

1047
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
are low or that it's still trying to

1048
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,639
move phosphorus from the lowers to the

1049
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,358
top or if you see that it's moving right

1050
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,879
you know moving nitrogen you can

1051
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:40,319
for when it comes to things that are

1052
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,559
mobile

1053
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,480
even things that are immobile

1054
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,320
you can know i need to add this this

1055
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,358
needs to go higher

1056
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,720
on this particular variety across the

1057
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:53,039
board um

1058
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,759
i've seen it

1059
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:58,880
what i see a lot of times is phosphorus

1060
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,119
requirement is greater for varieties

1061
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,320
that

1062
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,280
stretch

1063
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,760
yes

1064
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,599
absolutely cause yes yes

1065
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,359
absolutely and the phosphor phosphorus

1066
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,039
requirements can be

1067
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,519
vastly different

1068
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,679
that be different and

1069
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,920
the other thing about phosphorus going

1070
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,919
back to sugar is that if you don't have

1071
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,480
enough foss your photosynthetic your

1072
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,039
photosynthetic engine will be broken

1073
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,920
at some point along the way also if you

1074
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,639
get really low in foss it's very very

1075
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,000
hard to catch up

1076
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,440
and that's the biggest that's one of the

1077
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,039
biggest thing that people don't

1078
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,720
understand is that

1079
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,039
you could have a sufficient amount but

1080
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,838
as soon as you run out it could take you

1081
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,039
know

1082
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,039
weeks

1083
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,960
for it to

1084
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,920
get back on track

1085
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,880
from not having that adequate supply

1086
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,599
that it needs well because as soon as

1087
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,119
your foss runs low it starts the plant

1088
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,160
will start stealing from the older

1089
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,599
leaves

1090
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,879
and as that progresses um the lower

1091
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,559
leaves get

1092
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,960
lower and low low in amounts and your

1093
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:12,880
your photosynthesis also can start to

1094
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,639
shut down so when you add foss

1095
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,640
the plants what it's going to do because

1096
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,799
it's a mobile element it's going to send

1097
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,559
it to the new leaves so the old leaves

1098
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,200
are still going to maintain

1099
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,199
and be low for a quite a significant

1100
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,199
amount of time depending on how low you

1101
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,598
are so you're really going to have a

1102
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,759
very hard time catching up in the old

1103
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,039
leaves when the plant keeps sending the

1104
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,440
new

1105
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:39,759
it's it's very very difficult to catch

1106
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,838
up and many times um people can't and

1107
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,000
when your plant goes low and fast again

1108
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,078
that's the photosynthesis and then your

1109
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,159
sugars run low and that's definitely not

1110
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,200
what you want to have happen that that's

1111
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,598
not the

1112
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,879
that's not the train that you wanna

1113
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,119
you wanna be on

1114
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,000
so i had a question that uh came in on

1115
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,519
the the comments and it was asking can

1116
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,719
that can low phosphorus cause purple

1117
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,400
streaking in the stems and i will answer

1118
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:10,239
that that's yes

1119
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,720
low nitrogen typically number one

1120
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:15,199
um cause of purple streaking in stems is

1121
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,039
gonna be uh cajun imbalance

1122
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,759
it's going to be the imbalance between

1123
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:22,559
calcium magnesium

1124
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,560
and uh

1125
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,199
potassium

1126
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,358
sodium too if you have high sodium and

1127
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,480
it's blocking that out that's what i'm

1128
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:36,239
seeing also low nitrogen can cause it

1129
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,800
and then low foss can cause it to

1130
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:41,358
be careful when you're looking at your

1131
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,960
if you think that you're low

1132
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:47,119
nitrogen and you don't um

1133
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,599
you don't have a water filtration system

1134
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,760
you can actually have really high

1135
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,519
chlorides they have they

1136
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,319
they look the same

1137
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,440
so

1138
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:59,358
if you are having water filter then make

1139
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,358
sure and check your water filtration

1140
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,358
i've had multiple people say there's no

1141
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,639
way we could have chlorides coming in

1142
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,719
said when's the last time you checked

1143
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,719
your water they went to water

1144
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,800
that's one of the things that i usually

1145
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,838
tell people that they need to do if they

1146
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,880
have if i see high chloride on soil and

1147
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:21,679
sap uh our saturated paste testing

1148
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,880
um is fire bicarbonate and sodium

1149
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,719
because those usually come in through

1150
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,760
the water or they come in through ocean

1151
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:30,399
inputs a lot of times

1152
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,640
cannabis needs chloride all plants do

1153
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,358
it's a synthetic element

1154
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,400
but when we're not growing when we're

1155
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,400
growing

1156
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,318
to cultivate and we're not growing in

1157
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,000
the wilds

1158
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:47,679
as soon as your chloride

1159
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,920
starts to become uh not a photosynthetic

1160
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,239
element anymore but a toxin the plants

1161
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,639
are putting it down to the lower leaves

1162
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,639
it can withstand quite a bit of chloride

1163
00:43:54,639 --> 00:44:00,719
but in many cases

1164
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:03,759
um chlorides are in like 4 000. that's a

1165
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:06,239
significant amount of chlorides and your

1166
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,599
plant will push it down and when they're

1167
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,639
in when it's done pushing trying to

1168
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,640
um

1169
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,239
keep it away from the baby parts it will

1170
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,159
push it to the older leaves and when

1171
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:17,919
that fills up it goes down through the

1172
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,358
roots and out through the root exudates

1173
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,800
and what is that going to kill your

1174
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:24,559
biology so it is a domino effect

1175
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,599
yeah not only that but

1176
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,759
chloride is an anion so it will

1177
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,960
negatively affect

1178
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,680
the uptake of other anions if i'm not

1179
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,599
mistaken it's the biggest one the plant

1180
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:41,759
is so good at accumulating it absolutely

1181
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,760
and

1182
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,199
because of the inputs that we have and

1183
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,358
the water that we use commercially

1184
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:52,159
there's going to be chloride usually

1185
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:54,799
accessible too much to to the extent of

1186
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:57,279
uh being a toxin

1187
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,960
99 of the time there's a few areas that

1188
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,800
people are low in chloride and that's

1189
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,838
always fun and the doors wide open for

1190
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,760
them to use inputs but usually most

1191
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,159
i'm i'm one of those fortunate people i

1192
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,520
have pretty low chloride bicarbonate and

1193
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,239
sodium so

1194
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:17,039
i'm able to do things like c90 every

1195
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,598
once in a while which is a dehydrated

1196
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,279
uh you know ocean input that can help

1197
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,559
increase biology

1198
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,000
um

1199
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,920
is good and the really you're one of the

1200
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,838
awesome that you're able to use it but

1201
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,480
it does have a high

1202
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:35,199
element of sodium but because you have

1203
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,199
low sodium you're able to use it but i

1204
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,598
would really caution people that if you

1205
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,960
haven't ever taken a test before if you

1206
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,440
don't know

1207
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,559
um don't know your plants be careful

1208
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,838
about adding c90 because if you have

1209
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:51,679
even adequate medium sodium that that

1210
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:54,799
could they can climb i usually i

1211
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:57,279
recommend it usually as a

1212
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,039
foiler application where you can use it

1213
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,440
foilerly

1214
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,159
and then i think on my actually on my

1215
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,559
directions for use on the stuff that i

1216
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:09,279
saw on my website it says that you

1217
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,480
should have a soil test done to know if

1218
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,640
you're gonna

1219
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,480
be able to drench it or i'm actually

1220
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,799
coming up almost coming up on an hour

1221
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,599
here and i have a podcast coming up

1222
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,480
cheap home grow podcast

1223
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:25,039
um so i think we had a question about

1224
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,519
defoliation and the effects for uh

1225
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:31,279
acquired nutrient needs

1226
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,280
one of the things that i've seen is

1227
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,400
defoliation is kind of tricky because a

1228
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,960
lot of times in cannabis we

1229
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,559
prune up the bottoms and some of the

1230
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,960
mobile nutrients

1231
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,799
if you're not adequate and what's

1232
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,079
falling into solution

1233
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,359
the plant

1234
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,560
oftentimes

1235
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,559
will

1236
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,400
take from the lowers but if you have no

1237
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,559
lowers there you've pruned everything

1238
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,200
off and then you're you haven't

1239
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,039
addressed the issues that are

1240
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:02,399
in the soil

1241
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,800
then it can cause problems

1242
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,318
so the best course of action and one of

1243
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,640
the things that we do at our farm is

1244
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:11,519
when we do defoliation we always add a

1245
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,239
micronutrient solution to the soil

1246
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,358
to kind of counterbalance

1247
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:16,959
the

1248
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:18,960
the stress

1249
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,240
that is going to occur

1250
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,440
you know

1251
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:26,639
in an ideal world we could do testing

1252
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:30,240
you know weekly and be able to but one

1253
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:32,558
it's it it would it's not cost effective

1254
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,838
and two

1255
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:38,240
it takes time when it comes to shipping

1256
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:41,199
to doing the lab stuff so we get these

1257
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,719
snapshots and we have the snapshots we

1258
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,919
have to make

1259
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,358
educated decisions off of what we can do

1260
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,119
best

1261
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:51,119
for us uh

1262
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,318
from my experience

1263
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,760
being able to supply a light mixture

1264
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:58,480
even a full

1265
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,440
solution you can do things like

1266
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,480
a fully chelated mineral mix

1267
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,639
using amino chelation for instance to

1268
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,920
add after you do your defoliation to

1269
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:09,039
help

1270
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,800
you know

1271
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:14,000
decrease the stress load on a plant

1272
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,519
that's

1273
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,838
yeah because if you're going to be

1274
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:21,280
taking away nutrients via the older

1275
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:23,358
leaves adding it back is is obvious but

1276
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,680
that's an obvious solution and something

1277
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:28,159
that you need to look at basically if

1278
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:30,960
you're going to defoliate um you are

1279
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,239
opening up the plant for um

1280
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,240
quicker

1281
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:36,399
uh nutrient

1282
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,479
uh deficiencies basically because they

1283
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,358
pulled away the bank but i understand in

1284
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,199
areas there's need for it just

1285
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,920
be very proactive

1286
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,118
and you're adding it back into the soil

1287
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,680
as

1288
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:53,200
as fast as you can

1289
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:56,078
so i appreciate you coming on the live

1290
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:57,919
um i hope to continue working with you

1291
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,039
and doing some more step analysis in the

1292
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,800
future

1293
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,679
um if you want to let the people that

1294
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,839
are watching kind of let give them your

1295
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:08,558
your information where they can find you

1296
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:10,400
so they can follow along on the science

1297
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,680
that you're doing as well

1298
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,358
and then we'll

1299
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,960
we'll uh sign off

1300
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:19,598
yeah yeah wage laboratories uh in in on

1301
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,400
instagram it's the full long name new

1302
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:25,280
age laboratories uh we are also

1303
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:29,440
written up um cannabis uh science and

1304
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,640
technology there's an article um in that

1305
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,679
uh

1306
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,639
