1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,559
we're going to segue into our uh into

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:09,320
our recurring um strain

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:12,239
history um but we're gonna I'm going to

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,240
do a couple of notes first right about

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,278
it and one of the notes is going to be

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,079
is that as I said before the whole point

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,839
of talking about this strain history

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,479
isn't to come out with some like

9
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,118
definitive I'm right you're wrong

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,679
anything like that it's basically to

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,480
educate people on like what we know and

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,920
okay which just happened

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
um we want it to be an ongoing

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,120
conversation so if people are listening

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,039
to this and they end up hearing

16
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,878
something that they feel is incorrect or

17
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,480
they have Nuance that they would like to

18
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,878
add or they have tidbits that that they

19
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,759
might want to add right or they want to

20
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:53,399
correct things right that's not like us

21
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,799
being um you know we welcome that

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,480
absolutely we welcome the conversation

23
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,439
we welcome the you know people adding

24
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,478
pieces to the tapestry

25
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:07,438
right we doe of

26
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,438
credibility you say completely [ __ ]

27
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,599
wild I might be so some of so so some of

28
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,798
the stuff that we talked about on a

29
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,079
previous show um for instance to bring

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,759
up Gabby again he wanted to clarify and

31
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,879
he wanted to chat we've been meaning on

32
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,560
having to have him on to talk about

33
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,640
certain things

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,640
anyway and so like that part of the

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,599
ongoing conversation will happen well

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,079
he'll get his chance to clarify right

37
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,118
something else that happened that cool

38
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,399
that was really cool is last week when I

39
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,319
was discussing or we were discussing

40
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,439
sort of like what we knew about Jim

41
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,599
Ortega and the maple leaf right I

42
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,959
mentioned that while Jim Ortega was

43
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:50,359
still alive uh he was quite private and

44
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,959
he has chosen to rarely or for the most

45
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:56,200
part never but maybe a little rarely

46
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,438
speak publicly in depth about some of

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,039
the history of that kind of stuff right

48
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,559
and it does appear that he made friends

49
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,840
in the era he came back as dogist with a

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,199
handful of people that we share as

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,679
mutual friends and you know

52
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:14,799
acquaintances of our own and one of them

53
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,199
did reach out to us so cool is that

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,239
everybody probably knows who bod is

55
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,959
right when it relates to cannabis seeds

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,239
and and all that well uh bod and us are

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,959
friends right and so he reached out to

58
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,280
me because uh he listened to the show

59
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,519
and he was like hey man you know he's

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,680
done some work with the Kush for okay

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:43,640
and he's actually communicated with um

62
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,280
with Jim Ortega about details um

63
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:49,839
relating to the Kush for okay and so

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,560
this is lovely uh in a couple of ways

65
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,319
one it's because it it comes from uh one

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,680
of the um one of the really cool

67
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,238
breeders in our community

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,959
uh well you know what and I and I don't

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,759
mean to just like always black raincloud

70
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:10,400
[ __ ] but like more than

71
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:13,199
that very very few people besides bod

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,280
are looked at in such a way where

73
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:19,079
basically everyone thinks you have

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,080
nothing to gain by misleading anyone

75
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,239
that's antithetical to your personality

76
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,519
and who you are so if you have something

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,920
to say or something to add that at the

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,840
very least you're telling the truth

79
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:37,438
you're telling your truth what you were

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,400
told sure so with that being said we

81
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:42,639
told our truth or what we knew about the

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,599
maple about the Maple and about the Kush

83
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,238
for and the things that Jim Ortega gave

84
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:52,280
to Neville in a previous episode yep uh

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:56,039
bod reached out with some correspondents

86
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,878
from Jim that enlightened a little bit

87
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,359
about one of the lines we were talking

88
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:02,359
about which was the Kush for so before

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,239
we get into this week's um chat about

90
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,879
strain history I wanted to add to last

91
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,120
week's and say that Jim Ortega had

92
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,399
written bod and he told him that the

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,879
Kush four

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,319
seeds he they got in the early 1980s I

95
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,680
believe it was

96
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:22,040
1982 okay in New Mexico I don't have all

97
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,560
the notes in front of me so I don't know

98
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,040
which college it was oh yeah go ahead

99
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,240
but there was some but that's kind of

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,759
not relevant but in New Mexico in 1982

101
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,600
there was some Afghan exchange

102
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,800
students okay that came out to study at

103
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,840
this particular college and through

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,439
knowing him or his friends or some you

105
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:47,079
know Mutual circles or what have you

106
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:50,399
they got a hold of seeds from

107
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:54,000
Afghanistan from these Afghan students

108
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,638
of out of which the Kush for came and

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,600
what Jim Ortega said is that obviously

110
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,280
1982 was um pretty early in the game for

111
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,400
a lot of indicas throughout America he

112
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,319
said that those indicia lines that they

113
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,560
grew for a lot of consumers on both the

114
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,839
east and west coast

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,759
were very unique and very different than

116
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:19,038
what they were used to getting and they

117
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,720
worked with it a whole bunch right so

118
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,318
when I spoke last week about the Kush 4

119
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,919
I mentioned that we barely know anything

120
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:30,280
about it apparently it came to them from

121
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,519
uh exchange students from Afghan an in

122
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,159
the early 1980s in New

123
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:38,519
Mexico and it got passed along to Jim

124
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:42,479
Ortega and friends down there and they

125
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:44,399
ended up growing it and you know it

126
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,879
ended up getting blended into the USA

127
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,079
Market that way so something that's

128
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,120
interesting about the story and I that's

129
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,719
a cool story I love hearing about people

130
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,240
from unexpecting or unassuming places

131
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,120
being responsible for things I mean how

132
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,120
is it any more exciting than that right

133
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,038
random New Mexico Afghan exchange

134
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,639
students um but you know something that

135
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,639
really kind

136
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,960
of got with me about this story is that

137
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,759
it doesn't further explain what made it

138
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,038
to

139
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,720
Neville I would assume that the seeds

140
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,918
were reproduced whatever the push for

141
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
was and that became the seed stock

142
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,439
however the Clone that went around

143
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,360
because Jim didn't come back around

144
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:31,918
until about 15 years

145
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,160
ago that would have and I'm only using

146
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,359
knowledge that we have heard as a

147
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,439
community we know that Jim went away for

148
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,439
whatever reason that's a thing that

149
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,879
happened what is that seed stock that

150
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,959
survived that he popped and that clone

151
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,598
that goes or reproduce seed stock over

152
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,638
years from someone else and it doesn't

153
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,279
really put us any closer to certain

154
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,360
concrete answers because there is a

155
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,719
clone now that's from a seed line from

156
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,280
1982 when was that clone popped is that

157
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,120
clone in fact a product of pure genetics

158
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,519
or is it something and I don't think it

159
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,399
really matters to an extent but it's a

160
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:15,000
good example of we can know what we know

161
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,799
we can have more clarity added even from

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,279
the original source and still not be

163
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,639
100% clo like 100% spot-on and closer to

164
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:27,038
any definitive answers and I think

165
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,038
that's isn't that kind of part of what

166
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,478
makes cannabis magic it's all kind of

167
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,399
like I mean it's

168
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:37,399
cool so what what's neat about it is

169
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:40,560
that our little uh chat on YouTube Led

170
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:44,120
to uh more information getting shared

171
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,120
that was at one point private um and you

172
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,158
know it doesn't add a ton of depth to

173
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,840
the story but it does add some cool like

174
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:53,240
now we know where it came from now we

175
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,000
know how they acquired the seeds we know

176
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,280
what year they acquired the seeds we

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,199
know what state they were in at the time

178
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:03,399
all these different things now this

179
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,639
could also lead to you know um you know

180
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,038
uh this could also lead to more

181
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,360
information later on so I would I would

182
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,000
love to hear about it I mean so every

183
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,479
time we do this

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,800
segment it is a conver hopefully okay

185
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,399
not always but sometimes it might be a

186
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,639
conversation starter yeah where it

187
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,758
brings people out of the woodwork some

188
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,840
people might be like oh you were wrong

189
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:32,440
you were incorrect I would love to add

190
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:35,399
to the T AP of the story and correct it

191
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,240
or change it or add Nuance to it on a

192
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,080
future show like we're doing right now I

193
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,959
was born in the 80s you think I saw the

194
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,278
original kush for tell me [ __ ] more

195
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,239
like it's that's that's just the way it

196
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,039
goes and like you know and there's like

197
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,200
little nebulous things that you can

198
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,079
think and like it's one that I told you

199
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,160
and if this generates some sort of

200
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,879
someone coming to be like you don't know

201
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,039
what the [ __ ] you're talking about kid

202
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,360
by all means I love that [ __ ] I mean

203
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,759
no com getting Jim would be cool Jim

204
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,959
would be super cool um but you know

205
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,639
there's a lot of

206
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:11,000
oldtimers who are you know very

207
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,799
important to the scene um that don't

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,360
want to be public or choose to be

209
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,159
private and they might have private

210
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,240
connections and they might say things to

211
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,919
friends or what have you um but you know

212
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,680
uh there's a lot there there was a lot

213
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,479
of decades where keeping your head down

214
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,399
and staying invisible was the most

215
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,800
critical component to staying free

216
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,078
should we do should we do like a fund to

217
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:35,439
see how much money we have to fo over to

218
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:38,519
get Uncle Dave to come on God talk to us

219
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,519
about some [ __ ] I mean so anyway I got

220
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:44,639
at least one [ __ ] skunk one vintage

221
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,679
[ __ ] kilo cost on this interview so

222
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,399
if you're listening I'm here for it

223
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,519
buddy so we're gonna start this week's

224
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,679
we're gonna start this week's segment of

225
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,278
strain history on something that most

226
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,719
people have obviously probably heard of

227
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,000
or had some familiarity with uh we're

228
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,440
going to tell you what we know and we're

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,919
going to tell you a bit about like what

230
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,240
we think it affected and all that and um

231
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,719
this week it is white widow or on a

232
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,480
larger level the white

233
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,000
family

234
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,759
okay

235
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,759
so I think the basic story yeah is is

236
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,879
this right there is that white widow was

237
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:28,039
released as a seedline in

238
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:30,000
1995 by Shanti under the greenhouse

239
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,919
seeds label okay

240
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,200
okay and it won awards it was extremely

241
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:40,360
Frosty it won cannabis cups it quickly

242
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:44,240
became um one of the one of the big

243
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,959
strains of the next 10 years right um it

244
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,360
really changed the game in a lot of ways

245
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,719
and if you're someone like me from

246
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,639
California or Chicago or what have you

247
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,440
um you know you got that you got the

248
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,159
story that it was you know Shanti Baba

249
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,279
made it it was

250
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,600
from Holland right and it was dropped

251
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,838
under greenhouse seeds and that was the

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,920
that was the line that sprung into a

253
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,839
number of different like the white

254
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,278
family if you will Indian Brazilian

255
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,240
Indian was collected by him Brazilian

256
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,278
was some [ __ ] line called like the

257
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,519
kahba or some [ __ ] yeah that was his

258
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,919
story that was his story so then I go to

259
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:28,560
Amsterdam okay different story and it

260
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:30,799
turns out that um and it turns out that

261
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,799
most of the guys in Amsterdam would tell

262
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,919
you that there was this there was this

263
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,879
gentleman named igmar right and he was

264
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:42,000
cracking open a block of

265
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:46,039
hash and at least one maybe several

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,360
seeds fell out of it yeah

267
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:54,519
okay maybe we should clarify who he is

268
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,720
to like yeah go for it oh um he was a

269
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,879
big player in the early coffee shop

270
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,879
owner of an early coffee shop and seed

271
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,799
bank and

272
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:07,600
the as far as allegations go long before

273
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,319
it was called White Widow it was called

274
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,480
aram's Wonder you know based on the

275
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,760
little neighborhood outside of you know

276
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,240
I guess inside I'm sorry I don't know

277
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:22,039
that that City that well but like

278
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,560
General Amsterdam Metro greater area and

279
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,078
that's where it was being passed around

280
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:29,958
it was apparently being passed around as

281
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:32,638
a clone since maybe as early as 198 n

282
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,638
from what I've heard and that you know

283
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,680
if if someone who's actually Dutch wants

284
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,879
to be like again you don't know what the

285
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,919
[ __ ] you're talk by all means but that's

286
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,240
that's what I've

287
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,719
heard when

288
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,919
and what was his shop called when his

289
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,519
seat back that I forget but apparently

290
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:55,360
you go you could go in there and you

291
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:58,360
could buy I'm not gonna anyway you that

292
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,759
that was the tale okay and he got

293
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,399
basically this very pure very frosty

294
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,360
afghan that came out of it and

295
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:10,360
apparently he even sold clones of it out

296
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,278
of his coffee shop to certain people at

297
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,800
times what I heard

298
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:19,879
right um and you know so there's these

299
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,359
different origin stories right I was

300
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,519
around for neither of them so I can't I

301
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,480
can't add I can't add verification to

302
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,720
either one but what's

303
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,000
indisputable okay is that in the mid99s

304
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,120
Shanti released a seed line that was

305
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,480
called White

306
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,560
Widow okay and it took the Cannabis

307
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,000
World by

308
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,879
storm very quickly after he released it

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,078
it was white labeled by various other

310
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:50,278
seed companies in Amsterdam right

311
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,399
um and then the other thing that we

312
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,919
should mention too is

313
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,759
that the first cannabis cups and like

314
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,039
and the High Time stuff in the late 80s

315
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,720
a

316
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,639
a lot of the awards and a lot of the

317
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:09,278
pictures and stuff like that were pretty

318
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:11,480
ugly right the weed look ugly like the

319
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,759
um it just didn't it just wasn't very it

320
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,639
just wasn't very good by the mid 90s

321
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,399
when the white family sort of Hit the

322
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,759
market High Times had shifted and it had

323
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,039
a whole like Cannabis Cup special

324
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,639
edition right and the center of these

325
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:29,639
high times at that time would be very

326
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,879
glossy very high quality professional

327
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:36,240
photos of of pages of all the winners

328
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:40,039
yeah and I would say that was true 995

329
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,799
96 97 98 and so for people like

330
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:45,480
me okay um you know like you would get

331
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,120
high times and you would look through

332
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,120
this stuff and you would see which one's

333
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,159
one and you would see these high quality

334
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,959
photos and you would see all this

335
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:57,519
different stuff and you would drool and

336
00:14:53,958 --> 00:15:01,198
want to get um and and want to get that

337
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,560
stuff right yeah so so the white family

338
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,879
really changed the

339
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:09,399
market okay it Spa after White Widow

340
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,958
came out there was a strain uh we spoke

341
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,198
about it before it went from Peacemaker

342
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:17,758
to great white shark to shark shock

343
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,439
which was White Widow by Skunk one um

344
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,039
there was another strain called White

345
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,839
Rhino uh which was White Widow by a

346
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,759
different Afghan I believe I think that

347
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,880
he revealed in that last interview that

348
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,039
is indeed afan Maybe but didn't he

349
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,198
reveal that it is Afghan te in White

350
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:37,198
Widow as

351
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:39,159
well wiow I can't recall but there was I

352
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,278
would say the great white shark White

353
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:44,039
Widow and white rhino were sort of like

354
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,958
the three-headed Hydra of the white

355
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:48,838
strains through Greenhouse they all won

356
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:51,958
a bunch of awards um for the time they

357
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,560
were super photogenic they were Frosty

358
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:57,078
um they ended up getting crossed to a

359
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:59,439
bunch of things Simon from Syria seeds

360
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:03,758
took took the White Widow and crossed it

361
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,399
to his AK-47 line and he called it sh

362
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,720
and he called it white russian because

363
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,759
obviously the AK-47 is a play on a a a

364
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,278
Russian uh you know a Russian assault

365
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,120
rifle and that became one of like the

366
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:21,078
five or six strains that Simon sold for

367
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,519
decades the the you know the uh the the

368
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:27,758
white russian um and all that and I

369
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,278
would say that between 95 and the early

370
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,199
2000s

371
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,838
the white family became one of the

372
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,439
dominant

373
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,319
strains in

374
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:44,440
cannabis yeah absolutely I mean I feel

375
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:48,919
like if you got into weed and from like

376
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:52,079
maybe like 96 to like 2000 and like you

377
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:54,479
know 1998 1999 is when my little

378
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,519
juvenile shitthead mind started being

379
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,039
like Oh look weed this is a [ __ ] that my

380
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:03,720
mom and my sister smoke like I

381
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:07,240
uh like I saw those pictures like in the

382
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,400
you know 99 2000 High Times of like

383
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,880
white russian just like the two page

384
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,679
like ads where Sirius had like boom boom

385
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,240
boom Bud shot lined up next to each

386
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,319
other paradise had them too and they all

387
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,318
look so fire and I was like I have never

388
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,558
seen weed in the [ __ ] in the wooden

389
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,599
box hiding in the [ __ ] random drawer

390
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:30,759
that [ __ ] looked like that like

391
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:33,439
that's that's it this is it and and part

392
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:35,400
of it is that since High Times went from

393
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,279
like these like if you look at like the

394
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,919
the 89 and 90 High Times Cannabis Cup

395
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,519
photos or whatever they're pretty awful

396
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,600
photography I'm not a photographer

397
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:47,519
that's more crybaby's world but like

398
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:51,000
they're dark they're not very attractive

399
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,440
looking um they're small photos and by

400
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,519
the time the white family dropped like I

401
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,279
said before like the center of these

402
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:01,158
High Times would be multi-page big

403
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:05,639
glossy see different kinds of paper very

404
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:07,760
well lit much much much nicer nug picks

405
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,600
and those something something I want to

406
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:13,200
grab before it gets away from me because

407
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,798
there's so few so so randomly questions

408
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,279
I can just answer so accurately uh

409
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:18,798
someone said Sharon White Widow was

410
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,279
apparently popped from sensey White

411
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,000
Label stock in the early 2000s that's

412
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:28,240
correct it was popped by um Lone Star of

413
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,400
Texas resin company and uh it was real

414
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,480
[ __ ] lug but apparently real [ __ ]

415
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,880
strong I've seen the pictures of it um

416
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,440
one of those one of those dudes still

417
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,360
has it that was a buddy of his maybe

418
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,840
it's composer it's it's one of those

419
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,558
dudes they still have it no there

420
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,279
there's people out there that

421
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,918
legendarily finicky and a pain in the

422
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:51,240
ass to grow and and then the question

423
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,960
about a Aloha so that was Judge arizo

424
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,200
who's unfortunately not with us anymore

425
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,759
um neither is Lone Star from Texas resid

426
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,759
company unfortunately um but

427
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,400
so there's a cut and he had that it was

428
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:10,240
called like sweet thing and it was like

429
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,519
cherry and it came from a club in the

430
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,839
Netherlands called Aloha

431
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,639
Amsterdam um it wasn't really a seed

432
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,918
bank but they sold seeds and they had a

433
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,080
special White Widow cut that was indeed

434
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,640
a hybrid he went back years later

435
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:28,960
because it was so [ __ ] good and he

436
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,400
loved it so much and got more seeds and

437
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,440
that's where the FG of the Aloha Widow

438
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,559
from him came from as well see look look

439
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,320
I'm actually [ __ ] useful today there

440
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:42,918
you go well no so and you know I mean

441
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,038
the hard part is is that running or now

442
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,919
I see it cool if you talk if you talk to

443
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:51,319
people strong thing if you if you talk

444
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,759
to people in in Holland there are any

445
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:59,879
number of people that will stand by the

446
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:02,839
ingar story 100% oh absolutely shy Shany

447
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,159
has said that he developed it and it's

448
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:08,399
from him and that's incorrect right like

449
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,120
I said I wasn't there I'm so I'm we're

450
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,679
just telling you the two competing Tales

451
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:17,399
of how it came to be I'm just saying

452
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:20,080
that that second story could come with

453
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,919
like might be a lie but it might come

454
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:26,480
with like a free of the Dutch mob with a

455
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:30,759
gun to the side of your head as as AR

456
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:34,120
says this is our [ __ ] can say

457
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:37,000
definitively right is that it wasn't

458
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:41,918
until Shanty released his seed line in

459
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,880
the mid90s that it became world renown

460
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,919
and there was seeds available to

461
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,000
purchase if you just came into Holland

462
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:53,360
to grab seats right if the ingar story

463
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,480
is true it was basically a local

464
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,798
phenomenon right and that you could only

465
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,880
get the Clones if you knew him or you

466
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:04,839
you knew his coffee shop or or what have

467
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:07,679
you but when Shanti dropped it with

468
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:12,079
Greenhouse the next three or four years

469
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,400
I would say 95 96 97 98 is whatever

470
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,678
those years were dominated by various

471
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,400
White Widow hybrids or white widow

472
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,640
itself winning a bunch of Cups placing a

473
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,120
bunch getting a bunch of Fame they

474
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,159
become some same with some of the

475
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:29,959
biggest stories in cannabis uh Shanti

476
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,120
still sells a version of it he calls it

477
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,840
black Widow because when he released it

478
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:39,119
under Greenhouse um arjan uh trademarked

479
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:43,558
the White Widow name so he owns the

480
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:46,759
White Widow name right and um so you can

481
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:50,480
still go to Mr Nice and get a version

482
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:54,679
called Black Widow from him sure right

483
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,558
um you selling a version too and you

484
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,759
know what I've never seen them run back

485
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,359
to back by the same grower at the same

486
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,759
time so inam Mar's version is called

487
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,278
Master Widow and he's worked on it

488
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,119
progressively it's actually one of the

489
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:11,240
few parents that we know from anything

490
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:15,000
we know about uh what Luke's done at

491
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,400
Paradise seeds um so I I mean if it's

492
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,440
that coveted in that program must

493
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,440
something good must have come out of it

494
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,278
right however I haven't ever seen them

495
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,558
compared and I would have loved to see

496
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:28,640
that Ingam Mar's first seed iteration

497
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,839
first the first Greenhouse iteration

498
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,880
that would be that would really be

499
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:37,038
telling you know there's no doubt

500
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:40,278
there's no doubt that Shanti through

501
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:43,119
Greenhouse popularized it and made it in

502
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:46,960
the weed Community a household name sure

503
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:48,678
like that's and what's interesting is um

504
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,400
something that I'd heard and it was a

505
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,798
story that went around and it might not

506
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,640
be true but something I'd heard over the

507
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,720
years was there was

508
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,320
a former either

509
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,839
Dutch living but German born hash

510
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,960
Smuggler someone who was doing what like

511
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,599
Hank you know was doing early like

512
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,600
moving [ __ ] moving [ __ ] bricks

513
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:16,000
like getting it by by the way Bulldog

514
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:17,839
guy all some of those guys a variety of

515
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,159
them super legit they weren't just

516
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,839
random [ __ ] weed shop owners like you

517
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,760
see today these were dudes that [ __ ]

518
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:27,879
smuggled hash and [ __ ] really tried

519
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:31,879
to break down the laws where they were

520
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,720
[ __ ] or living and definitely those

521
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,960
dudes still deserve respect but

522
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,440
like basically what I was saying was

523
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,000
there's a story about one of the dudes

524
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,278
like that who ended up being an editor

525
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,200
of a very early counterculture magazine

526
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,720
over there having brought back random

527
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,960
[ __ ] seeds and even maybe some plants

528
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,000
from

529
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,519
Brazil and those would have but those

530
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,640
would have entered um the Netherlands so

531
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,359
so so much earlier than Shany got there

532
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,200
because he wasn't from there I don't

533
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,879
know people you know he's like Nev neev

534
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,038
was from Australia guess guess where Sal

535
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,120
he was from as well like most most

536
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:15,278
cannabis stories begin with a certain

537
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:17,918
amount of division and mystery because

538
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:21,480
they come out of the Shadows so to speak

539
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,320
um and so but what's indisputable is

540
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,240
that after Shanti released it under the

541
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,439
greenhouse label as white widow it

542
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,278
dominated for probably a good 8 to 10

543
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:34,919
years it got crossed into all kinds of

544
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:38,278
things it was one of those white Frosty

545
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,038
you know potent Afghans right and so

546
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:41,798
people crossed it there was a really

547
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,000
there was some really famous like Cuts

548
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,359
going around in the early 2000s around

549
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,319
here of blue widow right because they

550
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:51,038
took blueberry and white widow and they

551
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,599
smashed them together and it was much

552
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:57,038
tastier than white widow was and it was

553
00:24:53,599 --> 00:25:00,278
much more potent than the blueberry was

554
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:03,519
um and obviously like the white family

555
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:05,240
got crossed into all kinds of things

556
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,119
hold on before you go any further just

557
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,359
because I brought it up earlier someone

558
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,158
said motor breath is like white rhino

559
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,278
but less body and obviously motor

560
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,880
breaths [ __ ] you know got that kind

561
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,319
of [ __ ] petro camoo and remember when

562
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,480
we're talking about the clarity of

563
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,720
Afghan te you know yeah and that's

564
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,798
what's and that's always been

565
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,640
interesting to me is that if indeed need

566
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,200
white

567
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:36,120
rhino is Afghan te White

568
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,240
Widow that would be an example of one of

569
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,879
the rare combinations where Afghan tea

570
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,919
turns real nasty because it's

571
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,480
interesting to think of that as like

572
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,278
some skunk archetype and the father you

573
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,679
know the you know part of the like

574
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:54,558
greater scheme of the nastiness of Super

575
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,679
Skunk right that's how people imagine it

576
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,240
and whatever that dials into whether

577
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,759
that's this or that

578
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,839
but that same parent produces nothing

579
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:09,558
but sweet plants when you have the most

580
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:11,879
broad like squat versions of like Afghan

581
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:15,398
Haze which should theoretically also be

582
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,000
made with Afghan tea unless all of it's

583
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:20,678
in incorrect

584
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,960
um those are all sweet plants like

585
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,559
syrupy sweet like the way that the

586
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,798
dronkers described [ __ ] Maple Leaf

587
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:31,158
Indica seedline when it came out like

588
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:33,879
sweet or limey or [ __ ] whatever like

589
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,440
and that's interesting

590
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,240
because White Widow would be the kind of

591
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,720
parent or have the genetic capability to

592
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,679
make yeah Afghan te represent a skunk

593
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,640
instead

594
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,559
of skunk petrochemical I've heard people

595
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,520
say White Rhino [ __ ] horrible

596
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,558
airplane glue odors came out of it that

597
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:57,798
[ __ ] doesn't come out of Medicine Man

598
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,759
and no I've never seen it and like it's

599
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:02,079
white wi is an interesting breeding

600
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,079
plant I think that's what I'm getting at

601
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:07,359
something about it is unique enough that

602
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,720
it does drag out interesting things from

603
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:13,319
other hybrids that otherwise don't exist

604
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:16,640
in those hybrids it became one of the

605
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:19,918
modern building blocks of cannabis

606
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,840
because it became super popular through

607
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,080
winning all these Awards and High Times

608
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,000
it had some amazing pictures that drove

609
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,519
a lot of drooling because back then I

610
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,359
can tell you as a young seed buyer it

611
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:34,158
was very difficult to get a a hold of

612
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,879
things right these were all regular seed

613
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,520
lines at the time because the feminized

614
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,600
breeding thing had definitely not taken

615
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,798
off so when you bought them you got

616
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:45,079
males and you could use pollen to cross

617
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:47,599
on to other things it became so popular

618
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:49,199
that most of the other seed banks bit it

619
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,439
bought seeds of it made their own

620
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,399
versions of it people started offering

621
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,960
all kinds of hybrids of it it started

622
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:58,918
getting mixed into all kinds of things

623
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:03,240
right and it sort of became I would say

624
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:06,519
probably from I don't know 1995 to the

625
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:10,200
early 2000s it was one of the dominant

626
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:13,440
most popular strains in cannabis

627
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,240
and it's probably in a lot more things

628
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,759
than its name gets credit for oh

629
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,798
I'm just because the combination of

630
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:25,919
green houses popularity at the time how

631
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,639
many awards it won how many glossy Expos

632
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
and people getting like me being young

633
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,038
getting all excited going over to

634
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,360
Holland and buying that kind of stuff um

635
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:39,079
it really made a Major Impact right um

636
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:43,558
and whether it was bred entirely by

637
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:47,158
Shanti whether it was an accidental bags

638
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:50,000
not even bag seed hash block find from

639
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,840
block I love has whether it's some

640
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,599
hybrid of that and it's like Shanti took

641
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:57,639
the Clone and crossed it to Brazilian C

642
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,398
and worked it some before he you know

643
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,000
some did something to make it a seed

644
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:05,079
line right right whether or not he

645
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,558
created it from himself um and and

646
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,798
that's kind of like what we want to do

647
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,200
is rather than being like these people

648
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:12,158
are right these people are wrong I think

649
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,440
these are two slightly intertwined

650
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,760
stories that multiple people you talk to

651
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,278
believe

652
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:21,599
strongly

653
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:23,200
yeah right yeah um yeah seeds in a hash

654
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:27,759
block that literally I think that's

655
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,278
literally like a a seed fell out of uh

656
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,240
you know and in Holland back then most

657
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,519
Amsterdam was hash culture they really

658
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,000
weren't into they really weren't into

659
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,000
flower that much it was it was in the

660
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,200
80s especially most of those guys were

661
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
very hashish based right um and I I

662
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,840
don't I can't verify it or anything like

663
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,720
that but I will tell you that there are

664
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:53,319
multiple old connected people in

665
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,679
Amsterdam that believe that

666
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:57,720
story completely yeah not a doubt in

667
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:59,720
their mind like they don't they don't

668
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,240
even tell it like it's a supposition

669
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,480
they tell it like it's just like a

670
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:08,278
statement of fact yeah you know I always

671
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,159
I always think of homeboy's little

672
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:13,679
expose on Shanti where he was like I'm

673
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,960
the [ __ ] king of Amsterdam who do you

674
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,399
think you are but what's what was always

675
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,720
screwy to me about that is like other

676
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,879
than the obvious like straw man and

677
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,120
personal attacks and [ __ ] everything

678
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,278
else seemed very reasonable

679
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:34,798
like yeah yeah and this was the dude

680
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:37,440
that hired you that's that's so Ju Just

681
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,480
so people know probably does know some

682
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,159
[ __ ] [ __ ] that's all I'm saying if you

683
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,599
take the if you take the Shanti version

684
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:48,640
right obviously Greenhouse owns all

685
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:50,839
those names okay but Mr Nice sells I

686
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,919
believe White Rhino he calls it medicine

687
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:56,959
man today yeah he sells White Widow as

688
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:01,360
Black Widow and he sells great white

689
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:04,159
shark as shark shock yeah and I believe

690
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,439
Simon from Sirus still sells White

691
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,080
Russian yeah no he does I think it's one

692
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,278
of his I think it's one of

693
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:13,278
his I think it's still like you know

694
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,960
Simon only has six or seven strains he

695
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:19,919
sells he made a

696
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,720
new but it's just made of old things and

697
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,159
that I just mean white russian is one of

698
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,079
those half a dozen things that has been

699
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,120
on his menu since the

700
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:29,199
90s you know old boy call Miss fell

701
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,798
apart and

702
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,159
like I I hate to break it but no one

703
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:35,960
really wants like strawberry or kill or

704
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,080
like white Russi and they want the old

705
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,720
[ __ ] and like here's the thing even if

706
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,918
you lost the moms and you don't want to

707
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,200
own up to it because it came from a

708
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,720
result of a really bad experience

709
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,240
totally understandable your personal

710
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,720
business is your personal business but

711
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,599
if you have something that like people

712
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,759
have an allegiance to something that can

713
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:58,079
like you know keep your Legend alive I

714
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,759
would do absolutely everything in my

715
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,558
[ __ ] power to give someone the truest

716
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:04,200
version of what they wanted and what

717
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,278
they remembered especially if I was

718
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,120
playing with enough money that that

719
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:12,759
wouldn't be a problem it's at some point

720
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,518
it's about like it's strange to see

721
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:17,158
people who have been around for a long

722
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,319
time trying to burn their legacy to

723
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:22,799
squeeze a couple [ __ ] extra bucks out

724
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:25,638
of it at the end like you can you can do

725
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,240
whatever you want with your life fam but

726
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:30,278
like I I would I would hate this see

727
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,839
that like I hate to see Vernard selling

728
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:35,880
like random cheap CBD it's like you're a

729
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:38,558
[ __ ] Legend you personally I would

730
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,480
say that my favorite version of white

731
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:46,558
widow was The Peacemaker great white

732
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:49,120
shark uh shark shock uh line um there

733
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:53,158
was some some of the most potent weed

734
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:55,678
i've smoked from uh from over there was

735
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,480
uh was was that it's incredibly potent

736
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,320
I've talked about it a bunch and then I

737
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,919
would say like the best outcross I've

738
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,000
ever smoked I Mo I mentioned it before

739
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,559
was blue

740
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,519
widow which combined somehow the turps

741
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,359
of the blueberry line it was really

742
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:15,399
flavorful right but it was extremely

743
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:18,798
Frosty and potent and so it sort of took

744
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:20,359
qualities that each line had and merged

745
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,158
them with qualities that each line

746
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:25,079
didn't have like white widow was kind of

747
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,600
bland but it was very potent blueberry

748
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:31,079
was kind of had had some turpy elements

749
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,359
but wasn't particularly potent and so I

750
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:34,079
there was uh when I was going to those

751
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:36,638
like Harvest festivals and stuff like

752
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,879
that in the canab Bible era um blue

753
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:40,558
widow was a pretty popular one and there

754
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,399
was some fenos of it that were just

755
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:46,879
absolutely lovely oh yeah there was some

756
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:50,199
great blue widow out there even even for

757
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,120
a long time like yeah it was it was it

758
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,480
was a really it was I haven't seen it in

759
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:58,278
a really really long time um but it was

760
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,839
delicious and it was very potent and I

761
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:02,919
kind of thought that like it was an

762
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:06,119
improvement upon both lines oh I agree

763
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:08,720
the out the the outcross itself right

764
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:12,358
correct um and so you know if anybody's

765
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:15,319
listening you know uh if anybody has any

766
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:17,440
any um any key points or anything like

767
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,200
that or anyone has any like bits of

768
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,440
information about anything we talked

769
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,039
about on this little bit of strain

770
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,639
history by all means reach out to me or

771
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:28,440
crybaby absolutely and you know on a on

772
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,559
a future show or something like that

773
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,720
before we do that week's strain history

774
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:36,679
we might amend or add to or add some

775
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:38,878
Nuance to stuff we've said before you

776
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,519
know and all that type of stuff and so

777
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,519
we're going to keep doing this um you

778
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,079
know some of the strain histories it's a

779
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,000
littleit difficult because some of them

780
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,800
it's like we could talk for one or two

781
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,079
minutes about what we know and then you

782
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,320
hit brick wall right we sort of started

783
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,240
with the maple leaf and the white white

784
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,800
lines we sort of started it off on stuff

785
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,519
that we thought we could chat about for

786
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,160
like a good 30 plus minutes because

787
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:03,880
there was a lot of depth to them and

788
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,440
there was like versions of the story and

789
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,519
they had a big impact right there's no

790
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,280
way I'm not

791
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:14,519
shocking yeah you know and yeah so I

792
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,519
mean I'm just I was just telling you

00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:18,280
we'll

794
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,559
just basically like those two stories

795
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,119
those two sto reach out like and give us

796
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,639

797
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,000
ingmar's version of the tale this is

798
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:31,000
shant this is shanti's version of the

799
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,559
tale and whoever believes what it's upon

800
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,079
them and the the truth could be one or

801
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:40,400
the other the truth could be a blend

802
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,839
yeah you know it's hard to say you know

803

826
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:44,159
what I what I posted earlier so people

827
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,960
who are watching on Instagram I can't

828
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,118
put their comments up on screen so I

829
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,838
need to copy paste them from Instagram

830
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:53,318

831
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:55,599

832

835
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,880
was gonna do is give you guys uh both

836
