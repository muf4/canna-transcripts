1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,440
hey there okay field notes Afghan land

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:10,320
race this variety is called Chim tall

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,620
Tim tall and very impressed with this

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,980
one this is definitely a keeper so we

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:20,820
grew a few uh Finos of this uh we've

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,740
already harvested a few but this one is

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,539
probably the favorite of the whole mix

8
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,759
and maybe we'll just take a little

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,039
cruise around so you can see this whole

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,240
plant

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,240
and all of it splendor

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,058
yeah very traditional Afghan and then

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,460
we're finally

14
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,979
uh getting some colder nights so we're

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,140
starting to get a little bit of that

16
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,939
um you can see like on this Leaf some of

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,579
that black purple

18
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:54,058
action going that's uh

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,739
common with uh afghans

20
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,558
but still

21
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,299
we haven't had a lot of cold nights so

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,119
um if it got colder at night this whole

23
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:05,700
plant would start turning black which is

24
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,679
really striking and beautiful but right

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,840
now uh

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,240
this plant and by the way this one's I

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,760
think we're going to harvest it today

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:18,118
field note

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,000
oh the smell on this is like um

30
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,879
it's like mango chutney like a spiced

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,299
mango really beautiful

32
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,219
stunning delicious but deep it's got

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,100
like a deep

34
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,798
earthy ancient thing going along with

35
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,319
the fruit so anyway uh chimp tall

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,299
absolutely love it oh by the way while

37
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,699
we're in the neighborhood if you guys

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,720
just want to see

39
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,280
a big honking plant here's like a South

40
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,739
African variety

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,420
and by the way this thing it's even root

42
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,759
bound we haven't been had a chance to

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,259
fill in all the dirt so next year we're

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,959
going to grow these again and they'll

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,099
probably be twice as big so anyway if

46
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,219
you got

47
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:05,039
if you want to grow County Fair size

48
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:06,959
ridiculously large plants uh some of

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,020
these South African varieties are just

50
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,019
insanely vigorous but we'll get to those

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,480
later anyway we're focusing on you right

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,080
now Jim tall killer plant

53
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:18,079
all right
