1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,120
so native soils and

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,878
potting soils are going to be very very

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,199
different just like

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,599
a mineral soil that's you know rock

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,359
based or

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,638
rock and mineral based is going to be a

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,719
lot different than

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,239
a peat based soil like something that's

9
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,399
organic rich right

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,439
you are not going to grow things down in

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,399
the sacramento delta that was a drained

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,800
organic soil the same as you are you

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,799
know

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
somewhere outside of that region because

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,079
the properties are so different

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,480
so understanding cec is really important

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,119
but with potting soil and horticultural

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,159
it's a little bit

19
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:43,439
different right because in in

20
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,199
when you're growing in the ground you're

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,558
you're relying on that soil to provide

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
nutrients for you

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,079
through its organic matter and through

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,520
the fertilizers you've added

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,359
and typically it's not as easy to just

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
add a little bit more do a little liquid

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,359
feed do a little top dress it is it

28
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,479
is in more of a horticultural style

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,840
system where you're

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,759
in pots or raised beds so

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
you can take advantage of that potting

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,400
soil and and do that

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
dole out a little bit at a time and like

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,359
you guys were saying

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,719
earlier you know looking at plants

36
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,478
seeing what they're doing where are they

37
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,000
yellowing how are they yellowing

38
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,000
what's happening and then looking at

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,920
your soil test and being like oh

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,680
well i'm seeing this yellowing because

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,478
i'm short in this or i've got

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:32,400
too much of that you can be much

43
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:35,359
much more i guess direct in in your

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,680
feeding in a potting soil and that's

45
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,400
that's why i was developed right because

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,600
you can get high yields and shorter

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
turnarounds because you're

48
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,559
not waiting for things to warm up the

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,439
same or you're not waiting for

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,960
other processes in like a mineral soil

51
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,798
that are going to be slower than

52
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:58,000
in a potting soil interesting so you're

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,759
able to kind of you know

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,759
directly target your nutrient

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,038
provision in a lower cec

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,719
soil that maybe you didn't have

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,559
wouldn't have the capability of in a

58
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,759
higher ce soil if there's all of it

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,878
stored

60
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,919
you don't have that same kind of micro

61
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,079
management ability of the specific

62
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,958
exactly nutrient management an

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,879
interesting point

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
you can still do that same sort of thing

65
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,840
in a high cac soil

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
it's just going to be a lot more

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,159
forgiving than in that low c

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
c one like you're gonna have to no

69
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,519
matter what

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,440
dole things out and sometimes that's not

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,360
the most appropriate or the easiest or

72
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,199
most economic way

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,560
to do it i mean depending on what you're

74
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,039
growing cannabis or

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,479
or any other thing like the height of

76
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,519
the plant and the

77
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,878
density of the planting causes

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,439
problems with with that in some cases

79
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,159
okay but we don't really have that issue

80
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,000
we've got

81
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:03,759
the space usually right

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,840
and um the like potting media was

83
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,840
created to be able to feed and drain and

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,158
you know the hydroponic and the you know

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,640
horticultural media was intended to

86
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,878
drain and not hold on to a lot of stuff

87
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,799
and then native mineral soils amended

88
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,000
and this like super soil concept that

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,640
people are talking about turning potty

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,959
media into super soil is like

91
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,798
um because like your native mineral soil

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,840
building that up into a nice

93
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,439
like high cec you know forgiving

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,959
buffered type of soil

95
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,039
that's kind of that the gift that keeps

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,080
on giving longer

97
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,439
cycle put your amendments in and and

98
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,640
let them break down over time with

99
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,158
microbial activity

100
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,399
so that's why we talk about blending the

101
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,120
agriculture and horticultural concept as

102
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
you're taking

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,439
something that's supposed to be you know

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
uh you know feed and drain and rinse out

105
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,799
quickly concept with a

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,400
soil building you know you know concept

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,438
and then you're mixing them together and

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,879
then we're like

109
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,239
you know trying to wrap our heads around

110
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,199
what that means now because like we

111
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,480
understand

112
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,359
potting media organic versus native

113
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,280
mineral

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,959
and then what about when we mix them and

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,479
people come into the lab and

116
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,959
we try to gauge like well how much

117
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,798
mineral soil is in this potting media

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
well and then they'll tell us a story

119
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,679
and we're like is it 80 20

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,400
is it 70 30 is it 50 50 is it you know

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,840
what is it

122
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,120
and they're like uh you know you have no

123
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,959
idea i dug a trench

124
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,478
right and then i put some of the

125
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,638
original soil in there

126
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,519
and then i added it to the full brim

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,519
with the no

128
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,758
you just don't it's a spectrum right so

129
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,399
like you know people think of soil as

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,319
like

131
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,478
potting media native and like we're like

132
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,079
no we're like a spectrum here in

133
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:46,959
humboldt and like you bought that

134
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,359
potting media

135
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,560
20 years ago or last year well and

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
exactly right

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,918
something that ties into what royal gold

138
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,720
does is we wonder

139
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,279
what media was that because if you're

140
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,960
using

141
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,478
a lot of the traditional soils or

142
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,638
traditional soil building materials

143
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,800
these are all cellulose based

144
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,319
products yeah right and so they're

145
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,759
breaking down quickly

146
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,759
into smaller and smaller pieces and

147
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,439
being digested by bacteria way more

148
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,639
effectively we're at royal gold we're

149
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,639
building out of

150
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,560
like high lignin organic matter right

151
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,280
exactly right so it's gonna

152
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,600
last in theory it's gonna last longer

153
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,959
and

154
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
build fungus more effectively so

155
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,638
not only are you asking when did you put

156
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,759
what in but what

157
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,400
was what you put in made of yeah

158
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,360
yeah i think the you know the chemistry

159
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,719
or the actual

160
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,479
you know structures of the

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
whatever matrix we're growing in is

162
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,918
super important right

163
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,840
um there's such different chemistry

164
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,639
going on with lignin versus cellulose

165
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,879
materials

166
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,280
absolutely totally there's such

167
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,399
different chemistry happening between

168
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,478
peat and cocoa there's such different

169
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,359
chemistry happening between like mineral

170
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,560
soils

171
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
and organic based potting medias or

172
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,439
whatever

173
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
like totally apples and oranges right

174
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,879
and like structure structure's another

175
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,000
one that really

176
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,959
it interests me that we take these

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,800
organic materials and we farm them and

178
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,159
we call them super soils and we're

179
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
building

180
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,560
structure and we're building all these

181
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,959
things that like native soil inherently

182
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,959
has

183
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,279
structure you know they've got root

184
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,638
systems and there are earthworms and

185
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,239
you know aeration and movement of

186
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,840
finer particles coming through and

187
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,280
there's all this stuff happening that

188
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,159
affects the way

189
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,799
water drains and how the structure you

190
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,639
know so

191
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
it's not just the chemical properties of

192
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,160
the soil that are so different between

193
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,359
native and potting it's also

194
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,759
the physical structure of like

195
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
we create all the structure by sticking

196
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,960
you know whatever we're gonna stick in

197
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,000
there to aerate it perlite or whatever

198
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,359
you know

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,240
lava pumice whatever yeah and in the

200
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,038
same way that

201
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,519
really nature's doing it where you look

202
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,318
at like

203
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,839
the successional level of plants that

204
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,919
are growing in an area and how that

205
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,758
affects the soil biology

206
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:13,359
and chemistry totally where you can have

207
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,319
basically identical soil makings

208
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,000
but then you have a historical

209
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,639
meadowland that's all

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,399
low successional plants and it's all you

211
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,038
know bacteria driven soil

212
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,918
lots of weeds things like that and then

213
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:31,038
it borders right into a forest land

214
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,159
that has all of these lignin rich old

215
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,360
growth

216
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,639
you know conifer contributing

217
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,400
to the soil structure and you look at

218
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,160
the biological diversity and

219
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:46,799
how this the nutrients move

220
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
in these i nearly identical like you

221
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,120
said

222
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,598
you can spit to a different soil

223
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,598
structure

224
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:59,918
where does that tie in as well

225
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,478
to modern soil building

226
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,198
uh i have i have something to say about

227
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:04,639
that so

228
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,919
it's first of all it's interesting that

229
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,918
like with agriculture we're always

230
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,598
destroying the soil structure by tilling

231
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,478
up the soil but we want to build soil

232
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,478
structure because it's really important

233
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,758
and then with potty media it's an

234
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,399
artificial structure

235
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,319
right so we're like fluffing it we're

236
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,279
creating a fluffness

237
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,479
which is in lieu of an actual texture of

238
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,719
a native mineral soil

239
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:31,918
over geologic time has created

240
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,479
actual structure right so

241
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,120
riddle me this in order to develop

242
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,639
structure

243
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,240
in a potting media you first have to

244
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,679
destroy the structure that you built

245
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
which is the fluff

246
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,278
which compacts it then you add the

247
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,519
biology

248
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,519
and then that ties the morsels together

249
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,560
which then creates structure

250
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,320
which then would be closer to a histosol

251
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,479
which is like you know more of your

252
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
potting media that's been farmed and

253
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,159
refarmed for 20

254
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,439
30 40 years now you're kind of making

255
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:04,240
your own

256
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:07,200
histosol structure full living soil

257
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,039
so super soils i don't think it's

258
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,440
something that is created today and put

259
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,879
in a bag and sold to people

260
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,800
um unless i might have a different

261
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,519
definition of super soil but i think of

262
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,919
it

263
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,360
as a developed over time whether it's

264
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,838
organic or not it still has

265
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,919
still has to take time it doesn't have

266
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,279
to take geologic time

267
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,799
because and that's the other thing this

268
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,720
is let's speed this up right we've got

269
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,719
composting and cover cropping and

270
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
all these things and it just empowers

271
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,639
people too to say you know how many

272
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,719
billions of years it takes to form one

273
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,639
inch of topsoil or whatever it's like

274
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,759
well i'm never gonna get that

275
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,838
sorry can i swear on this oh yeah i'm

276
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,039
never gonna create an inch of topsoil in

277
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
my entire

278
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,799
you know however many generations what's

279
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,879
the point right and so we're destroying

280
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,159
it at massive rates but we can create it

281
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,278
at massive rates too because it's called

282
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,120
human intervention

283
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,480
so if humans can intervene in a bad way

284
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
and destroy stuff

285
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
we could also intervene in a good way

286
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,440
and build stuff

287
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:06,000
so let's do that that's

288
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,360
amazing and it's part of the whole home

289
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,240
composting movement

290
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
absolutely you really see us starting to

291
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,959
recognize

292
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,720
as a human culture that we can build

293
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,679
life or we can destroy life with a lot

294
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,639
of our choices

295
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,559
and the same comes to the world of

296
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,679
cannabis where we're looking to build

297
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,599
life

298
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,439
and in the world of soil building where

299
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,639
we're looking to build life and

300
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,800
we're trying to create a format when

301
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,078
we formulated these soils and started

302
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,078
looking at

303
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,599
the science behind what we put in there

304
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,519
was working and

305
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,959
you know discovering why some of it

306
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,720
worked we didn't maybe

307
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,000
know all of it when we built these soils

308
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,440
but

309
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,440
wow all of these things contribute to

310
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,399
building a structure long term

311
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,920
yeah and in a world where we are losing

312
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
top soil to erosion

313
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,439
faster than it's being created and

314
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,079
there's you know actually

315
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
soil endangerment and soil biology

316
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,879
endangerment going on

317
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,958
all over the planet this is another way

318
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,278
that i feel like cannabis

319
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:14,000
tying to hemp and moving into big ag is

320
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:16,958
going to hopefully benefit the world

321
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,679
yeah with potting media it's not it's

322
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,919
it's

323
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,958
it's always traditionally been meant to

324
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,719
just feed

325
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,518
the plant it was never intended to be

326
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,160
like a

327
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,278
living thing so when people started

328
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:34,480
digging their trenches like

329
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,240
you just changed a lot of

330
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,079
how things work right because now you

331
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,639
have this exactly pretty inert

332
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,439
medium i mean like it's it was organic

333
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,078
but it's not

334
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,560
really doing much it's just providing

335
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,799
space

336
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,039
for roots holding a little bit of water

337
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,078
holding a little bit of nutrient like

338
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:56,078
it's a planting media

339
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:59,199
exactly not soil soilless media

340
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:03,199
but its properties give

341
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,639
plants that jump start that they need

342
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,839
and so even though it's definitely not a

343
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,720
traditional bag ag

344
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
sort of thing the kind of idea of having

345
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,160
those

346
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,000
trenches makes a lot of sense right

347
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,159
you've got this

348
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,480
potting media that stuff can get growing

349
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,240
quick but it's also coming in contact

350
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,560
with the native soil which means that

351
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,600
it's coming in contact with all of that

352
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,518
biology it's all moving in and out and

353
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,680
transferring nutrients from

354
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,560
the organic matter that'll actually

355
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,879
break down in the soil right because

356
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,000
whether it's grass or tree cover doesn't

357
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,679
matter that organic matter

358
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,240
is turning over every year and feeding

359
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:46,078
the microbes feeding the plants

360
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,600
so having that potting media in contact

361
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,519
with the native soil

362
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:55,920
allows it to kind of be that gateway

363
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,919
and allow that transfer between the two
