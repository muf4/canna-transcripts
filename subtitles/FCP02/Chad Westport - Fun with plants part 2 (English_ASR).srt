00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,359
okay guys we are three days after you

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,198
last saw it in the previous video

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,960
i'm starting to notice that the leaves

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,039
are changing a little bit of color and

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,039
they're starting to droop a little bit

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,039
usually to me that means the clone is

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,920
ready for soil so let's check out the

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,920
roots on this bad boy

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,679
oh yeah

11
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,679
i would say that's ready for the soil

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,640
there we go guys that is the roots

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,198
that is the roots we got off of this

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,198
massive

15
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,519
freaking cloning attempt so now we're

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,359
just gonna put it in soil we're gonna

17
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,269
see if it lives

18
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,319
check out those roots

19
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:16,319
[Music]

20
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,719
all right guys we are 24 hours after

21
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,599
taking it from the aero cloner and

22
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,679
putting it into the pot and these things

23
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,839
look pretty limp there's not much water

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,400
pressure this is actually what i was

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,960
expecting when i took it as a clone but

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,118
hey it did good in the aero cloner uh

27
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,039
right now i've just been misting it with

28
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,280
some water kind of foliar feed it a

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,118
little bit if i can and we're going to

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,359
leave it in here and see what happens do

31
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:51,879
you think it's going to bounce back

32
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,879
put your comments in the comment section

33
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,599
holy cow y'all it's five days since i

34
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,359
took this thing out of the cloner

35
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,559
it was looking a little limp these

36
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,438
things were

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,920
down and droopy but look at that they're

38
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,359
up they're turgid there's water pressure

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,360
they're growing

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,080
so uh

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,840
i don't think i'm the first but

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,719
when's the last time you saw somebody

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
take a two foot clone

44
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,800
boom

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,120
breaking science

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,360
or whatever

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,560
now the only thing really left to do is

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,720
take this

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,840
and take the bottom half

50
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,959
and flower them and we'll see how we get

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,598
it

52
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,840
we're back we've got our top we've got

53
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,359
our bottom and we're about ready to put

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,519
these into flour

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,840
and for anybody that was curious the

56
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,759
amount of time this took is not very

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,519
much uh less than 30 days so it took 27

58
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:56,560
days actually on the 26th i made the cut

59
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,560
on the 8th i had my first roots which

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
you saw in part 1.

61
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
that was a 12 day difference

62
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,279
six days after that on the 14th i

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,040
transplanted it into the soil with that

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
big root mass which you see in this

65
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,280
video

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,199
and nine days after that on the 23rd

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,158
i'm putting them into flour

68
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,959
so in a month's time i really created

69
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,679
two plants out of one because of this

70
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,598
twin peaks two plant topping system

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,599
this bottom part you know it really

72
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,238
filled out it really filled in it became

73
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,560
a nice bush with a lot of top colas

74
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,319
these middles have filled in so oh

75
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,439
there's to be a lot of bud produced on

76
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,839
this plant

77
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,840
and it's a long way from that scraggly

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,878
looking plant in the beginning

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,878
less than 30 days ago

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,920
and we got our top you know it's it's

81
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,399
got nice water pressure in it now it's

82
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,318
looking good it's getting new growth and

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
really i'd probably let it go another

84
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,359
week but i'm putting it in the flour now

85
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,239
because hey rotation is rotation guys

86
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,439
um

87
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,920
we are 10 days into flower now and in

88
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,639
case i haven't said it yet i'm going to

89
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,318
declare this one a successful clone i

90
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,479
mean look at them we've got them

91
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,159
starting to form buds both the top both

92
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,439
the bottom we're getting nice bud

93
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,239
formation

94
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,680
so

95
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,599
yes this successfully has been a clone

96
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,800
and i am definitely gonna say that's the

97
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
largest clone i've ever taken i mean who

98
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
knew

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,080
but

100
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,399
like somebody i think mentioned in

101
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,599
comments this is good to know in case

102
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,560
you happen to snap a plant in half

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,240
all is not lost you know now that hey

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,639
you might just be able to clone that

105
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,639
thing i mean we took this thing we

106
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,280
chopped this plant in half

107
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,079
we stuck this part in the arrow cloner

108
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:54,159
we got some decent roots on it we put it

109
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:56,000
into the soil we let it veg for a week

110
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
it's been a flower for 10 days and

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,439
ladies and gentlemen it is getting buds

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,720
on it so yes that is a successful clone

113
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,719
and

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
you know another thing i want to say too

115
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,919
is all these buds here all these top

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
shoots

117
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,639
that you see

118
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,639
if these were all the way under here

119
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,879
there's no way they would get the same

120
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,038
amount of light and there's no way it

121
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,519
would produce the same amount of yield

122
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,560
that it's going to produce like it is

123
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,599
here

124
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,000
so

125
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,879
by chopping this plant in half did i

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,879
actually just increase my yield

127
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,719
it'll be interesting to know i'm curious

128
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,839
to find out and let me know in the

129
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,440
comments

130
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,319
what you think is going to produce the

131
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,000
heftier buds is it going to be the top

132
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,319
or is it going to be the bottom with

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,639
presumably the thicker

134
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,639
fuller root system

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,680
we'll find out but i'll keep you guys

136
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,840
updated so no worries there

137
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,400
another possible advantage to this is

138
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,038
this really helped keep my plant count

139
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:02,159
down you know i only was growing one

140
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:04,079
plant so i saved time i saved materials

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
i had one plant until i saw the pre

142
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,519
flowers and i realized it was a female

143
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,039
and then i turned it into two

144
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,680
that could be helpful for somebody that

145
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,199
is trying to keep their plant count down

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,120
because you only have to grow certain

147
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
amount of plants and then if you like

148
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
them they're females you turn them into

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,560
two give it 30 days as i did and voila

150
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,918
you have two nicely growing plants to

151
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,038
flower out

152
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,758
so

153
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,879
some potential advantages to doing this

154
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,879
twin peaks two plant topping system

155
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,478
but it's not you know i'm not going to

156
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,000
say this is a commercially viable

157
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,000
technique this is something that you

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
could do at home you can have fun with

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,839
it who knows you might be able to

160
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080
increase your yields keep your plant

161
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,038
count lower but it's something to have

162
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,478
fun with

163
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,569
and you gotta have some fun while you're

164
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:59,879
growing that's part of why we do this

165
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:59,879
