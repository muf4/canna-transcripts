[Music]

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,718
so here's a camp this question that I've

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,559
been pondering for a little

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:17,640
while at what point at what percentage

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:20,600
do the tpin become possibly I I don't

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,039
even know if it's possible but like

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,240
damaging you know to our lungs and stuff

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,760
you know where we keep searching for

9
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,439
these really high tpine profiles go

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,960
smoke some well there's got to be some

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,280
kind of number on like exposure to

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:40,399
like that's why I feel like rosin is

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,799
so like I I bet 10 years from now

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,640
they're going to be a lot of lungs that

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,479
even though you think it's healthier

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,159
you're you're you're getting that much

17
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:53,358
high dose of specific uh kind of

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,558
cleaning style turpion in your

19
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,399
lungs yeah I I was just thinking about

20
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,479
that the last couple months I was like

21
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:05,359
you know I remember growing some uh

22
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:09,319
oh what was it orange uh orange

23
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,280
something it was super [ __ ] T like

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,839
dreadfully turpy and whenever I smoked I

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,400
was like oh man my [ __ ] chest hurts

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
my lungs hurt like I don't know if it's

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,520
just that particular turine and

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,479
my my Constitution to it or what it is

29
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:27,920
but there's definitely a level tpine

30
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:31,560
toxicity would be a thing so yeah but I

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,040
I'm just curious like and if so like

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,040
it's it must be different for different

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,159
tpin so like

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,960
what T's good for every person there's

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,920
no way like yeah I it would be different

36
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,399
like because like how sensitive I am to

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,519
stuff like uh L right small amounts of

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,759
Lan will [ __ ] me up that's why I can't

39
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,759
smoke like lavender

40
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,478
strain every time I take a dab or

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,319
something like I have a dab rig my lungs

42
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,280
would [ __ ] feel like they're dead for

43
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,478
like a week and this Tony said it might

44
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,599
be the wax and the lipids and all that

45
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,319
you know what I mean something different

46
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,719
I listen to people dab all the time

47
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:13,159
their cough is different than somebody

48
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:18,439
that smokes weed sound off uh my style

49
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:21,878
grow my Instagram is right there Philo

50
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:24,000
Phil yeah like the the mac and stuff and

51
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:27,120
stuff with Mac in it

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,479
I I mean it looks like a beautiful plant

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,080
but I can't smoke it it tastes like

54
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,759
cilantro

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,319
it it gives it makes my eyes hurt

56
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,919
immediately after smoking it I mentioned

57
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,479
that to somebody who gave me some a

58
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,079
while back and also some cultivars

59
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,919
immediately when I smoke them make my

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,040
eye pain so much worse it increase

61
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,000
glaucoma pressure this F and the other

62
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,679
and some some of them it's just like

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,199
it's gone as soon as you get near it

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,000
like so there's they're not all the same

65
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,119
for me that's in my experience at least

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,280
not all the

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,360
same I can to get my excessive tpine

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,158
causes excessive

69
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,159
lipid perox oxidation production and

70
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,158
subsequent

71
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,959
apop so that could lead to

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,360
death well I mean I know I know with

73
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,000
tpin there there is a level but I'm like

74
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,640
I know cannabis tpin aren't any

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,959
different I know be able to grow it to a

76
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,479
level that's toxic or right even like

77
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,239
even I don't know if we can even press

78
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:34,238
it in to that because of how low the

79
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,200
level is on the amount that we're

80
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,360
getting like if lemoning on a plant's

81
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:42,199
not going to be at 4% by itself usually

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,200
it's going to be like 2% or less so

83
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:48,318
concentrate that into a uh like a wax or

84
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,399
something like you can do the math if

85
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,518
you if your weed was 20% and now you're

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,519
at 90 right you concentrated at five

87
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:59,438
times so 2 * 5 now you're up to 10% is

88
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,400
that level of uh that tpine toxic to the

89
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,078
human

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,680
that'd be like the maximum level we're

91
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,599
going to be able to get that to as a

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,599
singular tpine but then there's is the

93
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,639
mixture of those tpping worse than a

94
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,199
singular level like if I had all of them

95
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,560
at 10 is that just as bad as one of them

96
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,358
is

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,360
10 I mean I feel like this is a valid

98
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:26,519
question like taking a a hit off of a um

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,360
like a vape cartridge I can tell when

100
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:31,240
they've got fake [ __ ] turps in them

101
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,080
and [ __ ] like it it the way it sticks in

102
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,280
my mouth like we don't do that dude like

103
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,439
and it's not because they're growing

104
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,879
fire weed because they'd be selling it

105
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,639
in there dude instead of pressing it

106
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,519
completely and there ain't no weed in

107
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,240
the shop like it never it's never live

108
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,000
[ __ ] it's always something that it's

109
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,759
either an isolate that's had that added

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,360
to it man there's I don't care if the

111
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,960
carts are live rosin or or what they are

112
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,960
but anytime I take a a hit of those dabs

113
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,959
or or a cart or something like that I

114
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,279
get what I call the whooping cough cough

115
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,399
you know it's like it there's nothing

116
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:13,159
but with flow and stuff like the expect

117
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,839
expector expect however you say that

118
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,080
like you actually feel like you're

119
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,799
coughing something up you know but with

120
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:22,079
the dabs it's like this hollow

121
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,038
like and then when you try and breathe

122
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,560
again it makes you cough it's like Feels

123
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,918
Like It Coats my lungs with something

124
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,360
that's Dam near like coating lipids and

125
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,680
fats I I worked in a Candle factory

126
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,560
right and you could only work so many

127
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,079
hours because the amount of exposure

128
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,199
you'd have the fat and lipids in the air

129
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,359
they you couldn't do overtime after a

130
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,840
certain amount of time they would

131
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,400
literally have to have another person

132
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,279
for the next shift because of those

133
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,959
exposures of of fats and lipids like you

134
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:55,959
could stop breathing this [ __ ] now when

135
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:58,318
you're making regular bubble hash yeah

136
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,159
are you washing those fats and lipids

137
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,120
off

138
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,840
well sometimes depend usually not like

139
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,639
that's where like when people show their

140
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:12,758
their uh Tricom heads like real close up

141
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:17,560
like Jen's G or uh jendo like yeah jend

142
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:19,680
do um Jen um she also do static cleaning

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,038
but she showed water hash before too if

144
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
you do a high grade you're trying to

145
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,478
collect that head without disturbing it

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,038
that's why you don't put a lot of ice in

147
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:29,879
there that's why you want your water

148
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,519
cold as possible that's why like our our

149
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,159
levels of how we did it changed we used

150
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,639
to just beat the [ __ ] out of weed do it

151
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,280
for too long but you can take that and

152
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,360
that's where that that head with a lot

153
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:44,559
of fats and lipids actually is

154
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,800
beneficial because it doesn't fall apart

155
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,120
and allow those oils to not quite

156
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,038
emulsify but become part of suspension

157
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,560
in the water where theyd go through your

158
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:57,478
net like the screens aren't small enough

159
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,560
to catch like liquid oil so theny to

160
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:04,719
catch so then if you're

161
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,319
making straight water hash and you're

162
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,080
still retaining those fats and lipids

163
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,800
M when you when you press that you're

164
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,399
supposed to be getting rid of the fats

165
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,800
and lipids and just left with tpin and

166
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,839
how how are you getting rid of the fats

167
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,960
and lipids pressing it you're

168
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,959
emulsifying it

169
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:30,839
together with heat and pressure okay

170
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,240
okay at least that's my view like

171
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,478
those they they get they're small

172
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,960
they're going to pass through like if

173
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,199
you're using a 25 micron they're passing

174
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,758
through that right but some of it

175
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,000
actually based on how greasy it is can

176
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,919
like reabsorb back in the flow that's

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,918
why doing flow sucks and they went to

178
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:53,359
doing like cash but even with some of

179
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:57,079
that just quickly keep an eye for uh the

180
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,639
backstage I got it carry on why who'd

181
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:03,120
you invite would like um this all

182
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,598
just so certain bats and lipids would

183
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,158
definitely be more runny at different

184
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,959
temperatures yeah it's just like if

185
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:12,759
you've got Mantika or if you've got lard

186
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,038
or butter like they're all fats but they

187
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,720
all act differently there's like fat in

188
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,598
an animal also there's a type of fat

189
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,000
that melts and renders real easy and a

190
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,000
type of fat that will stay hard and

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,680
doesn't want to melt down is readly each

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,918
one of those acts different in

193
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,319
suspension even though water and oil

194
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,000
don't mix

195
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,240
the fact that you can break it up enough

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,958
to just end up in the water floating

197
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,599
around is why it'll pass through and you

198
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,439
don't catch a lot of your [ __ ] you're

199
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,599
trying to catch heads that are

200
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,680
undisturbed hot bacon grease will leak

201
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,680
through a SI cold bacon grease will stop

202
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,479
in it that's another thing to think

203
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,120
about and that's where the cold thing is

204
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,159
if you can keep that head from snapping

205
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,919
so breaking off and then shattering and

206
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,958
that's like where they ask about weed

207
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,559
that presses like all that's dependent

208
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,159
on I believe the fats and lipids that

209
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,039
are encasing it are they thick enough to

210
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,399
keep that from being disturbed during

211
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:12,039
the process okay so another question all

212
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,759
right now when we're smoking pause

213
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:16,360
shedar pause

214
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,720
shedar does hash make you cough also

215
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,639
hash makes me cough a little bit more

216
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,720
than

217
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:24,480
flow well yeah it's but

218
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,120
it's it it burns more smoke I would

219
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,519
believe whoops there we go there he is

220
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,278
hey G hey how are you hi

221
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,200
everyone thanks thanks for the impromptu

222
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:39,439
all right the impromptu jump on let me

223
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:44,160
give everyone context ghee co-founder Po

224
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,240
and Barkley I've known him since uh I I

225
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:50,679
love when we first crossed P I think it

226
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,519
was like uh 2016 is or something at uh

227
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:55,879
at what was it in San

228
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,759
Bernardino

229
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:02,399
UMO and uh so the topic is something you

230
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,120
and I were talking about in what you got

231
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,120
are you showing

232
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:11,919
something F you got you got the wrong

233
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:15,759
guy wrong

234
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:20,479
guy so so the the topic is is you and I

235
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:23,039
in Vegas were talking about uh like tpin

236
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,159
and like being kind of cleaning agents

237
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:29,559
and and the effect on lungs and so can

238
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:35,159
you kind of give your thoughts on

239
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:36,518
on rosin and lungs yeah AB absolutely so

240
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,719
because you've changed your perspective

241
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:41,159
over time right uh yes well look this is

242
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,120
the beauty of an emerging industry we

243
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,278
continue to learn we continue to dig

244
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,039
into the science and you know at Po and

245
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,278
Barkley and papa select our hash brand

246
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,679
we would say Best in Class which meant

247
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:54,879
you know the the more you know the

248
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,399
better it gets or like if I know better

249
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,039
I do better so we all have to stay open

250
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,879
in our industry for science to come down

251
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,958
and for facts to come out right because

252
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,720
this is not while we may have been in

253
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,599
the industry like myself for 25 years

254
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,959
been using canvas for a long time it's

255
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,920
only now that we're really getting the

256
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,838
scientific tools and Analysis that we

257
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:17,000
need to understand what's happening

258
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,720
right but when we think about uh tpin

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,759
okay naturally occurring tpin 3 4% in

260
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,440
the flow same thing in the concentrates

261
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:29,439
tpin are volatile organic compounds

262
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,240
right they are in themselves yes my

263
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
issue is one getting away from plant

264
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,759
medicine I'm going to tell you guys

265
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,879
right now I just recently sold Po and

266
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:39,519
Barkley and cannabis has been good to me

267
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,919
I am on a mission to crush distillate

268
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,440
everybody here seems old enough to

269
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,559
remember when the clear came out and we

270
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,120
were all like oh the clear we all wanted

271
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,319
diamonds we all wanted strong THC that

272
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,000
is drug and prohibition culture I'm sure

273
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,600
none of us are drinking moonshine right

274
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,720
now right reality is the gift of

275
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,519
legalization is abundance and to just

276
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,480
have tasty delicious things if you need

277
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,799
more use more but stronger is not the

278
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,839
answer that being said you have these

279
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:11,078
vape pen companies out here now using uh

280
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,600
voc's or tpin to one make their formula

281
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,319
thinner so that it can work in

282
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,600
cartridges and also amplify the taste

283
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,839
well that may present a problem I want

284
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,000
to level set smoking and all the

285
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,160
carcinogens associated with that are not

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,399
on the same level as vaping so we are

287
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,639
kind of like digging into the minutia if

288
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,720
you will but when you start to put eight

289
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,759
plus % tpin in a vape cart we do have to

290
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,879
ask the question is that presenting

291
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,399
extra

292
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,879
carcinogens into the lungs right isn't

293
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,799
it better to just have a better saucing

294
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,559
program or better yet work with your

295
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,479
Chinese or domestic manufacturer to find

296
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,879
an apparatus that will burn your viscous

297
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,920
oil and then I'll go on top of that I

298
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,838
started you know so when we met actually

299
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,399
in 2016 I was just finishing up and

300
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,279
still have a company in Colorado that

301
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,159
was a vape company and like everybody

302
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:04,278
else coming out of prohibition I wanted

303
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,278
to race to the bottom over refine

304
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:08,600
cannabis and you met me right when I was

305
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:10,759
meeting my partner it was actually late

306
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,680
2015 at one of these old school High

307
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,919
Times events with my partner Adam as we

308
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,799
were getting ready to start popping

309
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,879
barkle which is when luckily I was

310
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,039
pulled back into reality of plant

311
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,198
medicine first and foremost right and

312
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:26,078
solventless and clean clean cannabis

313
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:28,599
right all that said this notion that

314
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,359
Vape carts have to be the way forward no

315
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,440
now that we have puffo devices and all

316
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,919
these electronic vaping devices

317
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,760
shouldn't we just be understanding that

318
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,360
a nice concentrate and some aroma

319
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,838
therapy is the way to go you don't need

320
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,720
to put any more tpin in a good

321
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,360
solventless concentrate good for that

322
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,920
matter so this over tping of carts it

323
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,399
does worth saying are tpin volatile

324
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,799
organic compounds which they are facts

325
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,399
could they get to a level in Vape carts

326
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,479
where they become detrimental to our

327
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
health and the the answer is absolutely

328
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,000
yes for those of you I don't know if you

329
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,120
guys are going to MJ unpacked in a few

330
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,078
weeks here uh in St Louis I'll be

331
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,919
talking about what's on your shelf with

332
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,198
Alec Dixon and a couple of other

333
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,879
retailers talking about some of the

334
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,240
pesticide scares some of the scares that

335
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,519
we've had here in the

336
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,039
industry and tpin may come up right

337
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,679
because we need to as an industry kind

338
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,078
of self-regulate because if something

339
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,439
goes wrong we're we're on the wrong side

340
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:25,958
of this already right so we need really

341
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,199
have our p's and q's up and people throw

342
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:31,479
around Turin and RP stuff and add turps

343
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,159
willy-nilly forgetting that these are

344
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,360
carcinogens and they are found in very

345
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:39,600
small quantities in the plants and if we

346
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,120
one never mind unnatural tpin you can

347
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,959
get way out of pocket with that and even

348
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,639
if they're naturally derived cannabis

349
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,399
tpin putting too much in could present a

350
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,680
problem so that's just my general take

351
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,958
on turps I'm trying to St facts somebody

352
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:53,958
has different facts I'd love to hear

353
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,638
them because I'm always trying to get

354
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,479
educated no I agree with everything you

355
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,519
were saying um absolutely

356
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,278
is gabage but but I feel the problem a

357
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,600
lot with that like he brought up using

358
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:10,559
puffco and such great idea but it's hard

359
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,879
for us on the smaller side of this to be

360
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,039
able to fight big tobacco who's actually

361
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,838
the ones

362
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,759
pushing the the pin they're the ones

363
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,639
that want you to rely on something that

364
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,919
can sell you in a package repeatedly

365
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,399
with their label on it and replace the

366
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,479
product that you're not going to want to

367
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,078
use anymore which is going to be their

368
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,680
tobacco soon as Canabis becomes federal

369
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,078
legal everywhere you're going to be able

370
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:37,039
to pick up weed easier than tobacco and

371
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:38,719
you will switch over and they'll want

372
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,639
you to because of the price difference

373
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,720
in what they can charge you they can

374
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,720
charge you double triple for cannabis

375
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,360
what they can for tobacco they're

376
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,879
they'll take that away for a moment and

377
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,639
then that'll become a novelty where they

378
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,519
can re reintroduce it and say it to you

379
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,079
on a smaller scale but at a more

380
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,039
increased price they want to Corner

381
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,000
multiple markets with this thing and

382
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,879
they're hooking you right now with the

383
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,399
flavorings are added Kevin talked about

384
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,039
that where they're like adding fruity

385
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,240
flavors and such they they brought the

386
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:11,240
Menthol flavored part of cigarette into

387
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,839
the pin and it's a way for you to easily

388
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,039
get hooked to a product because it

389
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,040
tastes just like the one they're

390
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,159
replacing it with yeah absolutely and

391
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,240
look so I I would remind everyone and as

392
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,679
you guys are you know hipping people to

393
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,600
cannabis and cannabis becoming more

394
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,638
legal we are born of counterculture and

395
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,959
we need to stay counterculture one of

396
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,879
the terms I used the other day in

397
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,518
Chicago is this no notion of compromise

398
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,759
to legitimize we don't need them to

399
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,198
legitimize us we do not need to look

400
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,039
like Pharma tobacco or alcohol that's

401
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,838
why I'm not big on the Beverages and

402
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:44,000
yeah vape pens were about E6 and they

403
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:45,759
were supposed to reduce nicotine and now

404
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I have a teenager that [ __ ] uses more

405
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,399
nicotine than I do when when I used to

406
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,078
smoke cigarettes I almost wish she

407
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,318
smoked cigarettes at this point given

408
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,399
the addiction to nicotine right so to

409
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:57,120
your point we are being gamed as we

410
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,078
always have been one of the cool things

411
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,519
that Alec Dixon bought up about this is

412
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,078
as we talk about dirty things in

413
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,000
cannabis and all this testing popping

414
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:06,678
what we're realizing is they tried to

415
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,519
game Us by saying oh we need to test

416
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,079
cannabis to this level and what we're

417
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,240
finding out especially with the value

418
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,399
added products like you know gummies and

419
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,880
chocolates and all these other things

420
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,880
that are coming out is that it's the

421
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,280
rest of the supply chain that's super

422
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,039
dirty and keeps popping and testing we

423
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,678
have an opportunity here to really

424
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,959
continue our Green Revolution and Show

425
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,480
an example of what clean products can be

426
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,880
right and not fall into the traps of

427
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,400
tobacco trying to be it make it

428
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,320
convenient for us to your point like

429
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,120
with Menthol and the flavorings I don't

430
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,279
even I am so against flavors in cannabis

431
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,000
all the way down to Gummies at Papa

432
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,720
select we were blessed to create a gummy

433
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,279
where the only thing that flavored and

434
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,519
colored it was the tpin that's a strain

435
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:50,839
specific gummy does it take TLC to keep

436
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:55,038
those volatile uh TLC meaning tender

437
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:56,720
loving care to keep the vo's in the hash

438
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,480
so that it stays there and is potent

439
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,440
enough to flavor a gummy yeah you got to

440
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,599
want to do that but if I wanted a

441
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,679
strawberry gummy I would go to the mall

442
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,079
having a strawberry gummy or anything

443
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,159
that's not cannabis flavored in the

444
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,759
dispensary it's like why I could get a

445
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,280
flavored EIG anywhere I could get

446
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,720
flavored gummies anywhere I go to a

447
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,599
dispensary I want to taste all the

448
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,400
different strains I want to smoke all

449
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,359
the different strains that's what we

450
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,080
should be advocating for but yet when we

451
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,879
go into our retail outlets now they're

452
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,839
looking more and more like a CVS right

453
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,240
distillate fueled [ __ ] which is just

454
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:30,000
like Marinol and satx we had Marinol and

455
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,159
satex we had distillate products before

456
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,159
during prohibition now is the time to

457
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,960
say it's abundant and when it comes to

458
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,360
this notion of puup go and whatnot I I'm

459
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,319
I I want yall to just Vision in the

460
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:43,199
future to your point when cannabis is

461
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,798
easier to grow than tobacco much cheaper

462
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,000
there's a version of this where we are

463
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,000
not dabbing and holding it and coughing

464
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,839
but we're putting grams of of of rosin

465
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,400
on hot plates and letting it just aroma

466
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,918
therapy just breathe in delicious chirps

467
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,480
old yeah old that's the gift that we

468
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,400
should be for not this [ __ ] where

469
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,798
they're trying to keep putting taxes on

470
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,280
it because they're like oh well you only

471
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:07,038
need a few milligrams no I need

472
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,440
thousands of milligrams in the air all

473
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,440
in my face right it's a commodity and

474
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,080
should be based on how much it costs to

475
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,840
actually grow farmers are out here dying

476
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,720
because there's too much weed in

477
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,720
California and Oregon and Washington and

478
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,079
Colorado all our mature States one way

479
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,319
to solve that is to stop holding on

480
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,558
roaches stop trying to do Dives stop

481
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,720
trying to hold in the weed and just let

482
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:32,798
it out let it truly be free and in the

483
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,679
air right that's I think changing some

484
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,119
habits and some cultural things to

485
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,600
embrace this gift of abundance is what's

486
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:44,879
needed and not just just quickly show G

487
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,879
the rotten live rosin as a there we

488
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:53,599
go people it's it's the like the right

489
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,918
on demand is more of what they love if

490
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,399
they were never shown Parts people would

491
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,400
love oldw World hash just as much it's a

492
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,919
more it's a quality product that you

493
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,679
can't hide you can hide everything in a

494
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,840
cart

495
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,280
yeah well that's the reason it's in a

496
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:13,079
cart too yeah exactly 100% live Ros and

497
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,759
carts you know I mean those of you who

498
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,038
are familiar with some manufacturing

499
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,240
processes if you sauce which takes time

500
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:22,679
right there's no real way to that I know

501
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,000
of to quickly sauce and kind of separate

502
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,559
out uh your fats right to make it a

503
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,679
little bit less viscous to work in the

504
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,519
cart that's a Time factor and a lot of

505
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,759
people want to cut corners on that time

506
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:35,480
so they'll add tpin or sometimes they'll

507
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,720
add MCT and in the worst cases they'll

508
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,759
add PG or some [ __ ] like that right but

509
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,240
if you take enough time you can sauce it

510
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,640
out to have the viscosity secondly yes

511
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,839
you have to get a quality glass cart

512
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,759
that has gigantic holes so that it can

513
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:53,558
absorb a thicker material but lastly

514
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,558
carts are like the beer can of cannabis

515
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:58,000
it will only ever taste so good the fact

516
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,759
is you have an oil product that's going

517
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,599
to be wehe multiple times most carts are

518
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,919
in a clear glass cartridge therefore

519
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:06,599
exposed to UV light so that product is

520
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,799
completely degrading from the minute

521
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,798
it's it is a convenience factor so it's

522
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:14,319
hard to talk quality and convenience

523
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:16,119
cards have a high convenience factor

524
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,399
which by definition means their quality

525
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,359
is always going to be impacted right

526
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,919
look do I use carts of course I will

527
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,719
keep a cart especially nowadays where

528
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,600
people are all Draconian I have to have

529
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,319
one tap to my leg or something when I go

530
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,719
to the concert you know what I mean

531
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,038
because they're like frisking You Down

532
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,720
nowadays looking for lighters and

533
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,599
everything Amusement Parts too I used to

534
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,038
go to Great Adventure full of weed and

535
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,359
now they're not wait they don't call it

536
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,798
great adventure here they call it Six

537
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:40,240
Flags um you know they pat you down now

538
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,400
looking for all your weed and [ __ ] and

539
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,599
I'm like so you got to get the Vape

540
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,840
carts all hidden and whatnot so Vape

541
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,319
carts do have their place a place yeah

542
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,439
but it's not really in the quality

543
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,000
sector and so I know a lot of Vape C

544
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Vape manufacturers kind of like Bud

545
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,679
Light bestselling beer want to flex at

546
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,038
all these events because they got the

547
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,000
money because they're selling a lot of

548
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,879
product but I'm quick to tell you're

549
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,640
just like Bud Light I'm glad that you're

550
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,960
making money I'm glad that you have nice

551
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,240
market share but you will never be

552
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,278
quality period the end and like he says

553
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,319
like doing all of it right in a cart

554
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:12,599
that gets spurned over and over and over

555
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:14,599
that's like taking all your weed and

556
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,319
rolling it in one giant joint and you

557
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,959
smoke it all the time like that till

558
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,399
it's at the end the first hit was fire

559
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,360
but that last hit tasted like a [ __ ]

560
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,000
just dude it was booty

561
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:31,199
hole um now you were talking about carts

562
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,798
with the tur and added tpes do you think

563
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,679
flour will ever cuz everyone's searching

564
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:38,400
for a higher T percentage on their flour

565
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,798
nowadays as well because it carries over

566
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,440
to their hash and so on and so forth you

567
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,278
think we'll ever see that that negative

568
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,000
level of Tarpin and

569
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:51,400
flour you know it it's a great question

570
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,880
I think that more tpin and flour will

571
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,798
affect smok ability right I do think

572
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,080
that those folks who grow for hash are

573
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,798
growing for tarpine content because it's

574
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,359
getting lost in the processing right so

575
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,158
if you're growing for hash yeah I think

576
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,158
you want to try to get as much breed for

577
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,278
tpin as much but if you're growing for

578
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:10,760
smoke ability which interestingly enough

579
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:13,480
I don't know how many people are focused

580
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:15,000
on that these days um you might not want

581
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,079
to have so much tpin because it's going

582
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,558
to be harsh one point you're going to

583
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,399
smoke flour in a way that is not about

584
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,599
getting high but about how smooth it is

585
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,798
and how tasty it is and taste is how

586
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,519
much is the turine content but too much

587
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,158
turpine content tickles it back your

588
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,200
throat and it's kind of harsh too little

589
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,880
turkey content it's not wow in the mouth

590
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,640
so it's that balance right um same thing

591
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,000
with potency right right now everybody's

592
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,840
trying to be north of 30% THC and it's

593
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,880
like really I was just walking with my

594
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,119
wife the other day I was like one day

595
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,919
we're going to go and there's GNA be all

596
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,678
different ratios of THC and CBD it won't

597
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,480
be about potency it'll be about taste

598
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:55,120
turpine content and quality of smoke and

599
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,278
rooll right now we're all from I I

600
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,798
understand what happened to the pandemic

601
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:01,359
but these dog walkers and most pre-roll

602
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,879
sucking through a tiny little hole if

603
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,359
you would ask me if you ask me now when

604
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,400
cannabis is legal I'm going to roll

605
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,918
fatties the only pre-roll should be

606
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,440
minimum half inch in size to let more

607
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,679
air in so that it's a fun smoke just

608
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,038
like a cigarillo or whatnot right it's

609
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,400
like a cigar smaller than cigarettes

610
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,359
it's ridiculous it's so small you heat

611
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,640
up that cherry on it and it kills all

612
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,240
the flavor of the joint you want a small

613
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,200
and now you can do a larger grind

614
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,038
that'll hold itself instead of a tighter

615
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,919
smaller grind that's just pack the same

616
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:33,519
reason why they got big cigars and

617
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,360
they're better than a tiny little

618
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,918
[ __ ] pack of swisser sweets and [ __ ]

619
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,599
like those things taste terrible the

620
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:43,038
other day sh me for having a cannabis

621
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,480
cigar talking about well you know not

622
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:47,240
all of us can afford a $50 canar and I

623
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,120
was like look I'm sorry that I'm in the

624
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,679
future but can it shouldn't be more

625
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:54,038
expensive it's artificially expensive

626
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,360
we're out here overgrown right another

627
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:58,960
way to start educating consumers is roll

628
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:00,879
a lot of weed stop being scared of weed

629
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,319
Farmers want to sell more weed and

630
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,720
remember that double-edged sword when

631
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:08,839
people talk about

632
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,440
distillate that disempowers the farmer

633
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,599
and we can never let that happen because

634
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,840
the minute we're growing for biomass or

635
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,158
growing for that kind of extraction the

636
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,158
farmer's job doesn't matter solventless

637
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,399
if you're doing

638
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,559
rosin the farmer matters because if they

639
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:24,798
don't grow a clean product that's turpy

640
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,720
with big ass tricomes you can't get a

641
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,679
good extraction if the farmer doesn't

642
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,000
cure their flour and dry it correctly it

643
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,440
won't smoke well right so if we honor

644
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,079
our farms in the product they're

645
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,880
creating we'll get great product and one

646
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:38,839
way for them not to be backed up is for

647
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,720
us to change our practices around using

648
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:43,480
it truly truly start to use cannabis and

649
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,798
understand that this is an abundant

650
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,120
god-given plan and we held it back

651
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,119
artificially and now that it's Unleashed

652
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,479
let's let it in but many of our

653
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,759
practices stemming from compliance

654
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,079
unfortunately are still out of scarcity

655
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,599
and drug culture tiny little joints you

656
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,558
know what I mean five little milligrams

657
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,798
or vape carts and all these ways to

658
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,639
maximize our milligrams when we should

659
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,038
it's not the milligrams will come just

660
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,440
like alcohol is all standardized you're

661
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:12,879
gonna get drunk but on your way you're

662
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,519
gonna find the things that taste good

663
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,640
you know you're going to look for brands

664
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,759
that do it right that meet your values

665
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,440
we're not even having those

666
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,798
conversations in cannabis most people

667
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,640
not Mo I don't think anybody on this

668
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,119
call but the majority of money made in

669
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,120
cannabis now is being spent with bad who

670
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,798
give a [ __ ] about us don't care about

671
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,678
the farmers and are just creating

672
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,879
products to give you THC as if you're a

673
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:34,600

we could put together I love talking

693
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,519
about this you guys you know I I think

694
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,839
the the the the weirdness here is we

695
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,359
have this kind of legalization we have

696
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,319
all this misinformation they're still

697
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,119
trying to hold us back and so we can't

698
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,038
give up the we cannot give up the mantle

699
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,479
of advocacy there is a version of this

700
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,919
industry that is different than tobacco

701
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,640
alcohol and we need to demand it we need

702
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,480
to demand the abundance and the gifts

703
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,880
that this plant wants to give us and not

704
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,599
allow folks to force us back into this

705
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,720
Pharma Paradigm right it's a real

706

thanks I appreciate you care byebye see

710
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,558
again all right the original answer

711
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:08,959
about it I guess that's three at least

712
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,558
three now that are for exactly what we

713
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,919
said there there's a point of no return

714
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:16,639
where we're we're trying to get to

715
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,679
because it looks shiny and [ __ ] but once

716
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,519
you get there it's it's shiny Edge to it

717
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,960
that's probably going to cut us we don't

718
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:27,000
cheddar I think that was directed at you

719
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,000
when you're listening to your Sublime on

720
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,599
your porch and drinking your white claw

721
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,960
maybe switch it up to some red wine no I

722
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:40,199
guess my my my original question has

723
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,200
been answered

724
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:46,739
