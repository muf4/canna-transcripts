the garden Nord

18
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:12,959
I met my present wife walking in Studio

19
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,560
City during a torrential rainstorm in

December 2002.

21
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,359
I had woken up to the Rain pounding

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,280
outside and it was December and I was on

23
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,280
vacation at home

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,540
but thought to myself if I never get out

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,060
of the house I'm never going to meet

26

anyone

27
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,750
I had broken up with my last girlfriend

28
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,219
of five years six months earlier

00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,739

00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,640
I got dressed had some coffee

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,020
rolled a reefer and grabbed my coat and

umbrella

38
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:57,359
venturing forth from the apartment

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,660
I went down by the LA River aqueduct

40
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,780
commonly referred to as the wash

41

[Applause]

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,140
the water was four feet from the top and

43
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:14,539
moving at a good 30 mile per hour clip

00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,539
I lit the reefer took a hit

across cold water

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,378
walking behind the Sportsman's Lodge

48
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,659
along the wash I came up on the edge of

49
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:30,659
an office building parking lot next to

50
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,639
the Pins bowling alley

51
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,680
two girls were trying to get from their

52
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:39,738
car to the building

53
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,739
sharing my umbrella I helped them get in

54
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,878
crossing the boulevard I went into the

Native American art store

56
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,560
there were some beautifully crafted

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,259
silver and turquoise jewelry on display

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,060

00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,459
heading west along the south side of

60
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,199

cross the boulevard

66
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,120

the sidewalk into the crosswalk

made up my mind to stop and wait for the

81
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,679
girl

82
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,679
who had fallen somewhat behind me

83
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,060
she caught up with me on the corner in

front of Twain's

85
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,620
and I turned and asked her would you

86
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,040
like to share my Umbrella

87
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,920

my umbrella

92
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,519
where are you from

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,580
I looked into her eyes for the first

94
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,740
time they were captivating

95
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:28,500

98
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,159
anywhere it was and I knew the name of

while we walked I asked her if she liked

107
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,859
Algerian rimies

108
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,620
this got her attention as well

109
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,840
some white guy in Ventura who knew of

North African culture

111
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:06,179

Algerian singers cheb Khalid and cheb

mommy and others who kept walking

114
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,899
we got to where she was going a duplex

115
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,459
on more Park Street and the rain had

116
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,978
never let up

117
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:22,379
I asked her to take my number and she

118
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:25,699
wrote it with a lipstick liner pen on a

119
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:25,699
strip from a brown paper bag

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,360
after she went in I folded my umbrella

121
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,639
and went skipping through puddles with

122
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,819
the rain still falling back to my

123

apartment

124
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,740
the umbrella itself had a note I had

125
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,138
written years earlier on the name tag

126
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,620
inside the clear plastic handle

127
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,660
it read this is a magic umbrella

128
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,280
if you try to use it you may turn into a

and by 2006 it was time to go to Tunisia

133
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,660
to meet the in-laws and have a

Paris hang out with my wife's Parisian

139

relatives and then fly to Tunis

140
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,319
after Tunisia Italy would be our major

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,780
destination and we were anxious to spend

142
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,639
some time there after having studied a

the airport

150
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,680
needed two cars to move ourselves and

151
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,899
our luggage from the airport

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,538
a bit of an argument ensued over who was

153
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,758
going to put which bags in which car and

154
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,519
who would ride with whom

entire walking space in the room

a half an hour

while waiting at the Brussels South

00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,759
Railway Station we got out and I took a

351
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,620
few hits of a reefer I had while

352
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,198
standing at the end of a platform behind

353
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,379
a little Hut a little way away from my

354
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:30,379
wife

355
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,338
after a few minutes a voice from the

356
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,759
overhead speaker rang out

357
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:44,100
now departing for Paris

358
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:46,259
and we got back on the train and sat

359
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,899
back in our seats once again

360
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,778
watching the Pastoral Countryside speed

by

00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:57,360
we were going straight on to Florence or

363
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,519
ferenze as it is called in Italian

364
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,639
there we would begin our stay up in the

365
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,820
hills above Florence in fiesele at the

366
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,680
pensione benchista a converted Villa

367
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,339
across the street from Leonardo da

from its own Vineyard

[Music]

374
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,579
the thing about trains in Paris is that

375
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,039
there are six train stations that send

376
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:38,659
Travelers in different directions

377
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:38,659
depending upon the desired destinations

378
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,560
coming from Amsterdam by way of Brussels

379
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,879
we would arrive in Paris back at the

380
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,039
Garden Ord

381
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,919
and would need to take a taxi across

382
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,039
Paris to the gar Leon and board a Euro

383

star train South to Italy

384
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,659
most of the train stations in Paris were

385
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,459
built over a hundred years ago and are

386

over the platforms under which Sleek

389
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:10,860
modern trains and all colors pull in and

390
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,839
await the change of riders and direction

391
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:15,539
all sorts of people are hurrying this

392
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:16,980
way and that to get on board or to leave

393
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,379
the station

394
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,220
the garden horde is the busiest train

station in Europe

396
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,980
a little background here is in order

397
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,558
since my wife had not been home in years

398
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,500
when we went to Tunisia we were carrying

399
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,720
presents mostly clothes for a host of

400
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,058
family members and so we had giant

401
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,700
suitcases which we had purchased in

402
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:45,960
downtown L.A full of clothes for

403
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,720
everyone

404
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,759
each of us had two as well as a smaller

405
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,038
bag of peace

406
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,779
but now the suitcases were full of items

407
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,779
acquired in Tunisia

408
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,339
beautiful clothing souvenirs and all

409
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:00,960
sorts of special herbs for my

410
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,038
mother-in-law

411
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,919
and

412
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:07,579
I had my backpack with our passports and

413
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,580
my hashish

414
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,780
we hauled our bags off the train and

415
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,400
started walking down the platform into

416
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:23,279
the station

417
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,200
my wife was walking faster than I and

418
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,599
she had gotten ahead of me by about 40

419
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,700
feet and was about two steps behind

420
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,699
another female with large bags

421
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:41,220
seemingly from out of nowhere French

422
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,259
plane close police surrounded them

423
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,900
a woman cop stopped in front of my wife

424
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:49,019
and said

425
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,000
the French command for stop

426
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:52,740
my wife speaks French

427
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,900
and I could hear her speaking to the

428
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,700
woman cop

429
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,940
the other girl who was in front of my

430
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:03,140
wife had been stopped also and was being

431
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,140
questioned by another cop

432
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,840
I took this in as I Strode to catch up

433
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,939
some small voice in my head said you've

434
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:18,859
got to stop as well

435
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,860
obviously another voice said

436
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,419
the cops were directing the girls to put

437
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:26,879
down their bags and open them but I had

438
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:29,520
the keys with our passports and my

439
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,799
hashish and my backpack

440
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,339
my wife was putting the bags flat on the

441
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:34,339
station floor

442
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:40,379
the plane closed Squad consisted of two

443
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:42,359
women four men and dog

444
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,640
dragging my suitcases with a bit of

445
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:47,879
apprehension and Dread

446
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:54,840
I walked up and asked what was going on

447
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:57,120
[Music]

448
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,399
in charge of the operation and we'll

449
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,519
just call him Inspector Clouseau

450
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,840
ask me in a thick French accent who are

451
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,819
you

452
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,159
I'm your husband I said pointing to my

453
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,319
wife who by this time was standing next

454
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,279
to me asking for the keys to the locks

455
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:16,079
on the suitcases

456
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,660
Inspector Clouseau a dark-haired

457
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:23,720
middle-aged cop looking and sounding

typically French ask for our passports

459
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,319
by this time the dog had begun sniffing

460
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,099
through the girl's luggage who had been

461
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,099
in front of my wife

462
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,240
I took up my backpack and put it on the

463
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,640
ground unzipped it grabbed the keys to

464
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,798
the locks and the passports

465
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,820
and left It Wide Open right there on the

00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:46,819
floor of the train station

head

472
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:10,980
from his book of five rings I remembered

473
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,020
the section on rhythm

474
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,480
it reads

475
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,819
first of all learn the Rhythm which is

476
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,099
appropriate and differentiate it from

477
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:22,558

your Mastery of the way cannot be

considered firm unless you can avoid

480
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,580
being drawn into the rhythm of the

481
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,900
opponent

482
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:33,359
Victory is achieved in the way of

conflict by ascertaining the rhythm of

484

each opponent and by attacking with the

485
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:41,039
Rhythm not anticipated by the opponent

486
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,279
and by use of Rhythm in the abstract

[Music]

490
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,859
there were people passing all around us

491
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,600
and the train announcements were now

492
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:08,819
adding a surreal element to the

493
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,619
situation as they blared in the

494
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:14,399
background

495
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:17,339
we unlocked our suitcases as directed

496
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,679
Inspector Clouseau the man clearly in

497
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:20,759
charge had taken a particular interest

498
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
in me

00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:26,460
where are you coming from

he had our passports and clearly knew

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,220
we're coming from Amsterdam

502
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:34,139
did you smoke cannabis in Amsterdam

503
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,819
it was becoming a public interrogation

504
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,380
at the Garden Ord

505
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:39,379
he was playing a game with me

00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:49,199
people began to slow as they passed

gawking at the spectacle

508
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,159
doesn't everyone I ask

509
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,440
you snapped at me

510
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,600
I didn't ask if everyone smoked cannabis

511
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,980
I asked if you smoke cannabis in

512
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,418
Amsterdam

513
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,079
yes I did

514
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,080
the truth

515
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,259
by this time my wife was being asked if

516
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:09,658
she had any cannabis in the bags by the

517
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:14,038
woman cop who was now speaking English

518
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:17,039
to her after having seen our passports

519
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:19,460
but right then Inspector Clouseau turns

520
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:23,579
for me and asked my wife a few feet away

521
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:26,400
did he bring any cannabis from Amsterdam

522
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:29,460
she looked at me and asked did you

523
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,620
no it didn't I replied

524
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,240
it was an I Love Lucy moment and my wife

525
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,589
was about to win an Emmy for this

526
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,858
performance

527
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:40,858
[Music]

528
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,059
I look back at Inspector Clouseau and

529
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,400
realized he thought he had apprehended

530
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:49,980
couriers when he saw two unaccompanied

531
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,200
women with large suitcases and that

532
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,819
maybe I was part of the scheme

533
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,319
but we turned out to have American

534
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:59,480
passports

535
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:59,480
and somehow that didn't fit the profile

536
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,899
the dog was sniffing our suitcases with

537
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,340
little interest but my backpack was on

538
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,679
the ground a few feet away with the

539
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:12,839
hashish and double zip sandwich bags

540
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,159
sealed

541
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,158
I never looked at it

542
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,360
the dog sniffed and the inspector

543
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,079
shifted his weight to look at his female

544
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,079
colleague

545
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,079
[Music]

546
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,880
Clouseau walked away to confer with the

547
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,158
woman inspector

548
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,080
they talked quietly off to the side for

549
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,159
what seemed to be an interminable length

550
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,439
of time

551
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,059
which was in fact no more than 10

552
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,279
minutes

553
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:48,440
and somehow I was reminded of Edgar

554
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,440
Allan Poe's The Telltale Heart

555
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,710
[Music]

556
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,880
hanging with my wife we talked about

557
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,340
schedules and taking a taxi and going to

558
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,820
Italy and when were we going to be cut

559
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:04,819
loose

560
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,980
the inspector broke up the conversation

561
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,440
with his colleague eventually and walked

562
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:19,500
over and had me our passports and said

563
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,590
you are free to go

564
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,720
time to make an exit

[Music]

566
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,620
I put the passports in my backpack and

567
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:31,139
we zipped the suitcases and locked them

568
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:34,319
and I tossed the keys to the suitcase

569
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:39,080
locks in there zipped it shut and

570
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,079
hoisted it on my back Ashish intact

571
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:43,558
grabbing our luggage handles we made our

572
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,379
best nonchalant departure from the

573
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,480
garden Nord

574
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:52,580
walking out we hailed a taxi to take us

575
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,579
across Paris to the gar Leon

576
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:01,379
as the taxi pulled away from the garden

577
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,519
ORD we glanced back to see if anyone was

578
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,140
following

579
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,139
how silly I would later think

580
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,400
foreign

581
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:16,140

583
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:22,860
large clock tower in one corner

584
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,500
we boarded the URL star for Florence and

585
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:27,959
felt a sense of release as a train began

586
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,380
to move gradually speeding south from

587
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,380
Paris

588
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:37,259
in the late afternoon the train headed

589
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:40,379
up into beautiful Alpine valleys

590
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:42,200
the Alps rose on both sides and the sun

591
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,419
went down

592
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,460
we upgraded to a berth and slept as the

593
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,900
train passed through Switzerland on the

594
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,579
way to Milano

595
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,580
