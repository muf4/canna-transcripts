1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,919
howdy everyone this is lobsterfam farms

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,759
here at mcr labs with mike to ask a

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,039
couple questions how you doing today

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,359
mike i'm good how are you doing today

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,839
another day in paradise

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,399
so first um could you please explain the

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,480
importance of independent labs to verify

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,239
clean products in the cannabis industry

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,839
absolutely so independent labs are

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,679
really doing a service both for the

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,518
consumer of the product and also the

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,640
cultivators themselves

13
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,559
there's a lot of things that people

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
wouldn't necessarily know we see a lot

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,599
of incredible cultivators people who've

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,159
been growing cannabis for years and

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,600
years decades even at this point

18
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,119
i mean if you never had an impetus to

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
check things like your heavy metal or

20
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,878
even even pesticides in certain areas if

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,039
you're growing in a home where maybe

22
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,119
there was like extermination with the

23
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,399
previous owner like things things you

24
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,159
wouldn't expect

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,840
um through actually testing this product

26
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,919
you're able to pinpoint things that

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,199
could be hazardous to the consumer or

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
even the producer when they're working

29
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,159
with the material

30
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,799
and really give you an idea to make sure

31
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,159
hey this i'm growing things safely

32
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,919
my product's getting to the client and

33
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,558
it's safe and i'm also safe while i'm

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,159
producing this product

35
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,920
it's awesome to think of not only the

36
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,320
consumers but the producers you know

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
it's a it's a big circle

38
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:16,000
um could you please explain the value of

39
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,919
thc testing and as a side question do

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,319
you notice that the results have more of

41
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,400
an impact on sales in certain regions

42
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,079
over others that's a great question yep

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,118
um so we do see a lot of people are

44
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,039
chasing thc numbers in my experience a

45
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,239
lot of times it's either really new

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
people who don't know much about

47
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,158
terpenes or other cannabinoids or people

48
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,599
who are you know maybe even competitive

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,759
with themselves they want to push that

50
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,280
high thca number

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,478
but it's really useful for a number of

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
reasons right

53
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,039
so

54
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,279
even just outside of

55
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,240
thc or thca which is what a lot of

56
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
people are thinking of when they're

57
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,640
thinking of the psychedelic effect or

58
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,560
the

59
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,920
mental impacts of cannabis

60
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,439
there's a lot of other cannabinoids we

61
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,600
test as well

62
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,039
so for the consumer them knowing the thc

63
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,679
number is going to be useful because we

64
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,360
don't want anybody to consume more thc

65
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,759
than they want to we know nobody's going

66
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,359
to overdose on thc but

67
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,799
anybody who spends a significant amount

68
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,800
of time around cannabis has probably

69
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,840
gone uncomfortably high once or twice in

70
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,439
their life

71
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
that's something we really want to avoid

72
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,959
especially if you're looking for like a

73
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,799
therapeutic medicinal benefit you know

74
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,598
you don't want to give your grandma a

75
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,800
400 milligram chocolate chip cookie you

76
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,560
want to be like hey graham take this

77
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
it's mild your arthritis is going to

78
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,159
feel better

79
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,000
so from the production standpoint

80
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,840
cannabinoids can also kind of give you

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,318
an idea about if you're harvesting

82
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,200
potentially too early so we test for

83
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,560
cbga which is a precursor molecule

84
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,518
that's actually going to break down into

85
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,640
your thca or your cbda

86
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,039
and if you're noticing hey i'm not

87
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,719
getting the thc numbers i wanted to

88
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,560
you can also look at your cvga numbers

89
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,080
and say hey that's really spiked i

90
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
should go push a little further after

91
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,400
harvest it's going to let that molecule

92
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,959
turn more into the cannabinoid that i'm

93
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
really interested in

94
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,920
that's interesting and from my own

95
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,640
experience one of the lab tests i did a

96
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,878
couple months ago was a gmo cookie

97
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,958
derivative that's known to go a long

98
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,439
time i think i let it go 10 and a half

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,120
11 weeks and it still had 2 percent cbg

100
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,318
in it yeah so it was a clear cut

101
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,239
indication like you say and i didn't

102
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,839
know that before i started asking people

103
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,080
you know like is this something special

104
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,680
that it has this amount of cbg because

105
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,840
the other three or four tests i had done

106
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,599
with the same variety didn't show any of

107
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,158
those and it must just be that i took

108
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,759
those long enough and uh it's very

109
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,199
interesting and you know as these things

110
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,120
come across like they're they're

111
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,560
becoming more useful to me in my garden

112
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,759
you know even just a couple months ago

113
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
so now i know this round i'm going to

114
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,079
let it go at least an extra week and let

115
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,439
it go from there absolutely it's also

116
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
kind of useful as a tool for trend

117
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,680
analysis too right so say you grow the

118
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,359
same strain cycle after cycle after

119
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,439
cycle all of a sudden hey i'm down like

120
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,799
five percent thc that's when you know

121
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,639
there's something that's kind of wrong i

122
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,239
need to check out my hvac maybe i have

123
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,039
hot plate and thyroid

124
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,039
kind of clues you in

125
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,599
do you foresee testing of a wider range

126
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,158
of cannabinoids in terpenes in the

127
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,759
future absolutely 100

128
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,199
so we talk a lot about the entourage

129
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,359
effect in campus

130
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,359
myself i'm a pretty casual smoker in my

131
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
younger days i was chasing thc just like

132
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,480
everybody else but now i'm really more

133
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,079
interested in

134
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,280
what sort of unique effect am i going to

135
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,400
get when i'm looking at a bunch of

136
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,399
different terpenes at different

137
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,758
concentrations and levels what am i

138
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,000
going to get from different cannabinoid

139
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
profiles um i got a friend she gets

140
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
really anxious i say hey you need to try

141
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,599
maybe a one to one or something with a

142
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,919
little more high cbd i'm so broadening

143
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
our ability to dial in and quantify

144
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,000
these different compounds i think serves

145
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,279
the consumer in a really great way

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,240
really lets them tailor their own

147
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,239
personal experience

148
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,918
number four when do you think that

149
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,319
cannabis labs will be held to the same

150
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,758
lab standards as other industries let's

151
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,279
say calibration etc and that's with the

152
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,199
asterix if you guys don't feel you're

153
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,839
there already i'm just assuming that

154
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,600
cannabis labs are behind the rest of any

155
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,039
other industry let's say that's a great

156
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,039
question and a great point and it's

157
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
still a really fresh industry

158
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,639
so i talk to other microbiologists a lot

159
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,319
and we talk about other agricultural

160
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,319
commodities and they say hey you know if

161
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,839
you were if you were testing peanuts

162
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,759
there's this huge

163
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,359
statewide society of peanuts and they're

164
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,720
like everything needs to be exactly how

165
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,319
we want it to be

166
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,560
now it's really a lot more on the

167
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,000
individual labs themselves right so i

168
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,280
think i believe every lab needs to have

169
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,038
a 17025 iso accreditation

170
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,279
so there are minimum standards that need

171
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,279
to be met but anything beyond that is

172
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,279
really kind of up to the lab ownerships

173
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,559
themselves so we see

174
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,478
you know some labs are going above and

175
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,079
beyond which we really appreciate you

176
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,918
know you have good data integrity there

177
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,680
and then others are just like what do i

178
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,198
need to do to meet regulatory

179
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,959
requirements so

180
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,120
i think you know hopefully sooner than

181
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,359
later but if we end up at a federal

182
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,560
legal level i think we're going to see

183
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
some more

184
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,319
strictness and maybe some more structure

185
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,160
to the quality of testing

186
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,399
that was actually one of my next

187
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
questions it was uh

188
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,478
how do you first see cannabis testing

189
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,280
developing if and when national and

190
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,360
international markets markets open up

191
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,519
so we'll speculate that it is let's just

192
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,919
assume that three to five to ten years

193
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,000
it's open how do you foresee the the

194
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,918
testing industry kind of aligning with

195
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
each other or the feds demanding that it

196
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,120
gets aligned right i think we're gonna

197
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,280
see kind of a change in how things are

198
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,600
tested and i i'm hoping that we'll see

199
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,599
more data transparency so we see a lot

200
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
of the times now a lot of cultivators

201
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,919
have issues with microbiological action

202
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,439
limits i'm a microbiologist so i'm more

203
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,959
on the side of caution but i'm also an

204
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,959
outdoor grower and i understand the

205
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,120
reality of the situation

206
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,959
so i might see things like regulations

207
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,879
changing maybe for an outdoor cultivator

208
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,638
raising those action limits maybe with

209
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,959
the transparency that on the label you

210
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
can read a cfu program or something like

211
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,159
that

212
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,680
and then to that degree as well as it

213
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,120
becomes federally legal we're going to

214
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,639
be able to actually do research at

215
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
universities and we're going to see see

216
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,240
what's going on

217
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
we often times

218
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,680
at adam sierra down in massachusetts

219
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,119
we're doing speciation so we're able to

220
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,639
say hey we have this fungus that we

221
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,079
found on your plant

222
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,879
we dive into that a little deeper and

223
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:07,439
it's like oh it produces abc mycotoxins

224
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,120
that are not required um by any state

225
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,478
for testing so

226
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,079
hopefully we're going to see a broader

227
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,758
understanding of cannabis as an

228
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,120
agricultural commodity and we're going

229
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,598
to know hey maybe we should be looking

230
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,199
for these mycotoxins and not these maybe

231
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,439
this is a safe

232
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,439
microbial action limit versus this

233
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,478
what if any are the differences between

234
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:33,279
testing wreck and med cannabis and do

235
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,758
you notice a difference in med versus

236
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,679
wreck as far as cleanliness

237
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,960
potency or just whatever other things

238
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
you guys are looking for are you really

239
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,638
seeing a difference and uh if so what

240
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,199
are they sure

241
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,639
i don't think we have a big enough data

242
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,560
set at this point to really notice a

243
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,439
huge difference between the two i do

244
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,280
know in

245
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,038
maine i believe it is

246
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,519
recreational required testing versus

247
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,839
medical which is not required

248
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,598
so we might see things that are kind of

249
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,000
sneaking under the table in medical if

250
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,439
they're not getting tested

251
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,199
but really as far as the quality of

252
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,719
production most people that are growing

253
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,960
cannabis want to grow the best material

254
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,720
possible so it's it seems to be pretty

255
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,878
standard across similar as far as

256
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,639
potency and uh terpenes and all that it

257
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,520
seems like everyone's kind of yeah just

258
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,519
trying as hard as they can

259
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,318
um seven this is a tough one how do you

260
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,319
feel about the salary rates for cannabis

261
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,080
lab techs and does that match up to

262
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,199
other industries this is a great

263
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,719
question

264
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,959
unfortunately at this point we don't

265
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,240
have the money that big pharma has so if

266
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,439
you're going to be a lab tech who's

267
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
working for

268
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,519
pfizer

269
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,038
you're obviously going to make a lot

270
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,959
more than a lab tech that's working on a

271
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,718
cannabis analytical lab

272
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,559
the difference there though is you're

273
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,320
kind of associated with an industry that

274
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,159
you might believe in you might have more

275
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
of a personal stake in this you know

276
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,000
somebody that medical cannabis has

277
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,600
helped a lot and that kind of helps to

278
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,360
dull the sting if you're not making as

279
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,519
much as your body who's working in with

280
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
big pharma yeah but you know hopefully

281
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,919
as the industry matures we'll see those

282
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,879
pay rates start to kind of become more

283
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,719
um in line with each other yeah

284
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,320
i love that answer though because i

285
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,959
don't think that it's necessarily

286
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,959
drawing the bottom of the talent pool i

287
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,879
think it's drawing the top of the

288
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,639
passion pool is the way that i've

289
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,278
thought about it and i'm hoping that the

290
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:22,639
salaries catch up to that passion as it

291
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,240
becomes more normalized and the rest of

292
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,278
the society will see the value in it

293
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,000
essentially absolutely

294
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,559
and lastly um it's another tough one

295
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,440
what do you think of all the allegations

296
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,919
of labs and some that have been caught

297
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,920
skewing the test results and let's say

298
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,159
if it's a vertically integrated lab into

299
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,479
a grow in a retail shop or it's just a

300
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,079
friend's lab or it's even just a

301
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,320
business partnership that someone might

302
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
not know they're involved in it and

303
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
these things are happening in the

304
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,959
industry it's not just speculation

305
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,278
people have been caught out and i want

306
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,278
to know how do we keep corruption out of

307
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,759
the cannabis labs as these things move

308
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,679
forward so that we do so that the

309
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,600
cannabis labs do get the respect and the

310
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,838
verification that we're going to need

311
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,079
moving forward right that's an awesome

312
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,720
question lab shopping is a real and big

313
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,958
problem in the industry right now

314
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,639
unfortunately kind of

315
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,838
relies on the regulators to make sure

316
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,159
that's all right but there's a couple

317
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,440
steps we could take to kind of bring the

318
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,199
issues to the foreground and make

319
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,360
everything a little more transparent

320
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,120
personally i'm really in favor of data

321
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
transparency i think that you should be

322
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,000
able to know where products tested and

323
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,439
you should be able to see the exact

324
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,278
results i don't want to know hey this

325
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,079
passed for yeast mold i want to know hey

326
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,759
what was the exact cfu program with this

327
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,439
if we see a lab and it's passing

328
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,278
everything for yeast mold like that's

329
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440
not reality it's really growing

330
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,679
yeah exactly you know

331
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
but things like secret shopper programs

332
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,838
like what they do down in massachusetts

333
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,839
are really useful you can buy a product

334
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,680
maybe a regulatory body like the ccc

335
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,680
take it to a couple different labs and

336
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,519
if there's huge discrepancies then that

337
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,120
should sort of indicate to you hey

338
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,399
there's a problem here

339
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,399
interesting i haven't heard that being

340
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,679
done yet anywhere that's awesome

341
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,320
yeah we hope to see it happening all

342
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,879
over the place if possible yeah

343
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
i think maine is still you know ahead of

344
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,159
that curve

345
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,159
because it's not so competitive yet to

346
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,039
where people are going to those

347
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,399
lengths to ensure success so i'm hoping

348
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,120
that we can get ahead of the curve

349
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,519
before we fall behind

350
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,879
ethics and moral practices you know

351
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,240
right yep you know from a business

352
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,919
perspective you want to have the highest

353
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,600
thc possible and you want to pass as

354
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,120
much product as you can

355
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,320
but you're not doing yourself a service

356
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
if you're going to be lab shopping

357
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,800
because eventually this will get cracked

358
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,360
down on yeah and if your grow is full of

359
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,879
microbes and you've been lying about 10

360
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,800
of your thc it's going to bite you in

361
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,838
the butt yeah the reputation is going to

362
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,519
be more valuable than a quick high score

363
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,440
you know i mean that's what i think at

364
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,278
least

365
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
i don't know if we'll use this after the

366
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:52,559
interview but one thing that i found

367
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,078
very interesting uh

368
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,439
i've lived in other states i've been

369
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,278
involved in the industry since 2005 and

370
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,600
maine is the first place where i've seen

371
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,759
where the thc results whether it be the

372
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,839
storefront or the consumer they could

373
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,278
really care less and i think it's

374
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,200
something special and if it's 25

375
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,799
30 12

376
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
like it doesn't seem to really make a

377
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,000
difference

378
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,720
on whether the patient or the casual

379
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,639
consumer or the big storefront or the

380
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,120
casual delivery service it seems like

381
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,440
nobody cares and like i'm still shaking

382
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,959
my head at this like i don't get it but

383
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,839
i do think it's kind of cool where it's

384
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,638
just like

385
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,480
results oriented or you know i mean you

386
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,639
could call it bro science but i feel

387
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,399
like in conjunction with the actual lab

388
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,079
science and also

389
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,240
with people just you know they're

390
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,159
anecdotals you know i mean we should we

391
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,839
should think that that matters because

392
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,919
that is real data to me even if it's

393
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,600
like grow science to some people

394
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,439
and uh it means an anomaly it's crazy

395
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,040
yeah you talk about broad science my

396
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
background's a little bit more like

397
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,559
plant soil science pretty particularly

398
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,000
when i got into the industry i was

399
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,078
growing with a lot of cultivators and

400
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
they were using the broad science and

401
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,439
it's not all broad science right they

402
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,360
might just not know the the scientific

403
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,680
terminology the phrase what they're

404
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,120
observing but to your point yet i mean

405
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,599
these are anecdotes that we should be

406
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,519
investigating i mean as we see federal

407
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,320
legality hopefully we can actually dive

408
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,759
into that and get to the bottom of it

409
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
the narrative i've been trying to kick

410
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,078
recently is bros with science yes i was

411
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,399
like if anyone's heard of the the

412
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,159
government lab in mississippi that grows

413
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,879
it's like to me that's science without

414
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,879
any bro yes and i've never had the

415
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,639
displeasure of trying their products but

416
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,639
for many of the few people that have i

417
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,759
mean they've never given rave reviews of

418
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,839
you know you gotta go 100 science like

419
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,519
these government labs have it dialed in

420
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,279
for the dank so

421
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,720
looking at it that way it's like i'm

422
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,958
really trying to kick the narrative of

423
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,639
bros with science like people that

424
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,559
because science is just observation like

425
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,079
you say repeating experiments i feel

426
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,399
like people are getting a skewed vision

427
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,759
on what science is and i think the bros

428
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,679
have been doing it a long time even if

429
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,439
they can't really

430
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,519
describe what they've noticed in the

431
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,800
right way like you say like i think bros

432
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,440
with science is going to be the way

433
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,319
forward like for the dank you know

434
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,160
absolutely yeah

435
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,480
and uh yeah i guess that's about it

436
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:18,360
yeah that was awesome

437
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,360
we like to call it citizens
