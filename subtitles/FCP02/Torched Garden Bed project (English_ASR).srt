1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:05,639
how I took over the

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:14,000
yard I started

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:18,118
with that one single 4x4

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,719
bed and then I added that one and then I

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,759
added added added and then I added

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:27,518
around the

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:31,920
tree and then did all that stuff over

8
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:36,039
there I'm also G to rip out

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,800
all these uh fabric pots and put

10
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:43,000
in uh wood and

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,000
octagon around the

12
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:56,358
tree we have a little Garden Project

13
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:57,280
right okay yeah I think so what are we

14
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,039
going to

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:05,118
do build a hexagon that's right so we're

16
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,599
going to take no bro why so see all

17
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,920
these wood pieces so what we're going to

18
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,719
do you sand them uh I have not sanded

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,240
them yet but we're going to make a

20
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:19,438
hexagon to go around so I'm going to

21
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,399
pull all these pots out of here mhm and

22
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,000
the

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,600
hexagon is going to go around there it's

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,319
basically a little over 3

25
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:33,359
feet uh actually yeah diameter

26
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:37,078
uh or from like middle to middle of both

27
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,719
sides Bubba are you just making more

28
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,599
space well that's a good question what I

29
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,560
wanted to do was if I could get rid of

30
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,640
all these pots and then I could build

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,519
the hexagon and then I could fill it

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,118
with all the soil from these pots and

33
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,879
then when stuff grows down it would also

34
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:58,280
grow into the

35
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:01,560
ground see like this morning glory right

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,399
over there which just yes baby

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
cake ba that is the Morning Glory I

38
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,959
think I think it was a very good idea

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,239
for you to make that axon because this

40
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,280
Garden looks like a junkyard with all

41
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,319
these thank you it that is true we're

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,878
going to make it look less like Sanford

43
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,878
and Sun's

44
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,920
junkyard so here here is our cutting

45
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,079
station right that's not really a good

46
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:33,000
cutting station all right so there's our

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,280
saw all right who doesn't touch the saw

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,519
you I am allowed to no definitely not we

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,000
don't want is it the opposite exactly we

50
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,439
don't want to chop your fingers off no

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,439
it's the opposite about you right and

52
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,239
about you you will not be touching that

53
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:49,759
saw but anyway so we're going to cut

54
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,120
each of the how many pieces of wood are

55
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:58,120
in the hexagon okay so we already have

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,800
two then four five I'm guessing about

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,560
six that is exactly right there's six

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,719
pieces of wood in the hexagon B why does

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,719
that look like deuce water that looks

60
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,878
like dece water look like I dropped a

61
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:16,439
big deuce because it has um I just it

62
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:20,759
has some uh I poured some water through

63
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:24,120
the worm bin and then I also put

64
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:27,439
some uh if you ground up

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,239
fish and it would be a little stinky but

66
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,239

make sure you don't okay so see how this

69
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:52,200
all right look at that with the

70
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:55,359
camera ready tap tap on I tapped it bro

71

00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:05,039
turn turn it this way and we're going to

75
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,199
do the same thing can I tell something

76
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,438
before you do that I would love but you

77
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,798

time so

79
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:25,240

do is I'm going to

83
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,680
dump all these re amend them and then

84
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:41,198
put them in the use that soil in

85
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,959
the in the beds and then a lot of times

86
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,439
when I have way too much food scraps

87
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,279
baby cake they go and don't tell Mommy

88
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,719
but they go under all that

00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:55,409

see is that a good

94
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,758
cut is that the 30° angle you were

95
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:27,080
looking for that is not what it needs to

96
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:30,280
be 90° no 90 we we make a box make a

paying attention to which side I want on

the

122
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,800
outside that makes me

123
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,539
sad on the early ones I wor start you

124
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:22,149
will be the

125

[Music]

126
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:30,240
inside all

127
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
right so we got

128
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,990
here that's the bottom of the

129
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,319
hexagon so we got six

[Music]

131
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:46,240
pieces and those are going to

132
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,240
go around the outside around the

133
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:53,719
outside so anyway this will change from

134
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,120
and I'm waiting I just harvested a bunch

135
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,919
of this waiting for this stuff to finish

136
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,759
but as that finishes I'm just going to

137
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:06,038
amend all the soil in

138
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,598
there and use that as the

139

volume for the

00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:13,158
hexagon

141
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:13,158
so

142
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,598
yesterday we

143
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:24,839
cut so we're making a raised

144
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:26,439
bed that is going to go around this tree

145
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:30,439
so I'm going to make a

146
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,439
hexagon and

147
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,278
so yesterday we cut the wood so we have

148
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,918
these

149
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:41,120
30°

150
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:44,958
Cuts so if you keep going that would be

151
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,600
a perfect hexagon these are each uh 3

152
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,399
and 1/2 fet

153
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,680
long

154
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,519
and basically what we're doing is we're

155
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:58,719
going to replace all these um Fab big

156
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,919
fabric pots with just one raised bed

157
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,240
around the tree

158
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:06,799
uh and then once uh like here I have

159
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,120
some tobacco finishing seeding out so

160
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,039
when that's done I'm going to cut all

161
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,440
that down I'll dump all the soil in here

162
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,759
but one of the thing so this is some

163
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,920
heart

164
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,399
Redwood and one of the things I'm going

165
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:25,078
to do right

166
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:27,679
now is actually Char it uh so I know

167
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:27,679
like

168
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,519
um I guess

169
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:36,518
like ancient Romans when they uh went

170
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:39,720
into like modern day Germany and France

171
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:44,278
and were building forts they would

172
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,480
uh Char the the tips of the Timber that

173
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,480
they would stake into the ground so that

174
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,600
it wouldn't

175
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:54,839
rot uh and in Japan they have a building

176
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,560
technique I think it's called Yaki Sugi

177
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,200
uh that may be a gross

178
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,518
mispronunciation but basically I'm going

179
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,519
to Char this and then I'm going to uh

180
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:09,560
stain it with

181
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:11,919
some uh I'm thinking flax seed oil uh or

182
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,159
teak oil or walnut oil but I think flax

183
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:19,559
seed basically something that's not uh

184
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:22,600
toxic but that's also uh while I do have

185
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,078
a whole lot of olive oil inside I'm not

186
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,399
sure if that's going to go rancid

187
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:30,919
and although I'd love to use the olive

188
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:33,679
oil but anyway first up

189
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,679
let's smoke some

190
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,800
weed so this is

191
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:39,799
24K cross with

192
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,000
uprise very

193
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,480
tasty all right and here we

194
00:10:50,879 --> 00:11:00,958
go cuz what project is not more

195
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,958
fun when you are super high

196
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,199
so I do not have my little helper today

197
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,800
she's it's about to grab the torch for

198
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,799
the be a little less

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,159
aggressive all right

200
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:35,719
so let's do one of these at a

201
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,919
time uh the good news is I really don't

202
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,278
care about this grass I'm actually

203
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:44,599
trying to fill in this

204
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:46,078
divot so I uh have been dumping biomass

205
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,240
in there to build it up and then just

206
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,519
letting any

207
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,680
seed right like this

208
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,000
is Mullen

209
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,719
seed so you see a bunch of mulling

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,039
growing in there and then I'll uh I put

211
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,800
like

212
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,199
I don't know heavy on top of it to

213
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:08,909
kill it

214
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:25,190
down but anyway Let's uh

215
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:25,189
[Music]

340
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,319
two right

341
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,799

[Music]

566
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,260
[Applause]

567
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,920
anyone boom all right

568
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:33,159
Gemma you are all done thank you for

569
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,159
your

570
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:41,000
help so it's the home

571
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:44,000
stretch uh what I'm doing the last thing

572
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,639
is I'm going to put these uh

573
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,440
support pieces up so

574
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:53,759
basically possibly two on each one but

575
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,720
at least one so either two or just one

576
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,160
in the

577
00:40:54,719 --> 00:41:03,078
middle and then I was going to do corner

578
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:05,719
brackets so angled brackets uh I ordered

579
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:09,920
these but they're even though it said

580
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:13,159
30° I think yeah they're 15 they're

581
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,960
basically not the right uh

582
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:19,759
angle but they're also uh ridiculously

583
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,480
thick I was thinking more something

584
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,040
that's

585
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,000
like that

586
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:30,880
thin uh so what I got instead

587
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,719
was just

588
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:38,200
uh these little thin pieces of

589
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:41,118
aluminum uh which does last a long time

590
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:45,960
and I was just going to cut them angle

591
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:49,318
them and then drill so that at

592
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,318
least uh yeah anyway some additional

593
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:57,199
support but it should be

594
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:57,199
good so anyway let's start with

595
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,030
these

596
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,030
[Music]

597
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,879
ones these are 1 and 1/2 in

598
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:09,759
screws figured since the thickness of

599
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,760
the wood is 2

600
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,519
in we did all

601
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:23,920
right so how many of these do I

602
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:25,519
have we got one two three four five six

603
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,119
all right I only have eight of them so

604
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,119
we're just going to do one on each

605
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,880
but that should

606
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:36,440
be this one

607
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:40,800
looks let's get

608
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,800
this yeah we'll get you out of the

609
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,960
way we'll

610
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:51,960
go all

611
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,960
right here we go

612
00:42:53,230 --> 00:43:00,188
[Music]

613
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:21,599
[Music]

614
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,599
so conceptually what we're doing

615
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:33,720
[Music]

616
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,358
did

617
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:39,598
too see we'll just keep going

618
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:43,480
around getting

619
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,480
close so then this

620
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:55,440
stuff I still would like to find

621
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:58,400
that stray

622
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,880
screw basically I'm going to cut

623
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,000
it but it'll go there anyway I was

624
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,000
thinking just kind of like

625
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
that

626
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:18,200
not I should probably go thicker

627
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:18,199
but that can be the first

628
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:27,240
one so anyway if you

629
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:28,439
had since finding 30°

630
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:32,879
angle

631
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:34,679
brackets it's not as easy as IID hoped

632
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,079
so if I just do

633
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:39,078
boom and boom

634
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,079
right all right

635
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:09,240
yeah so in retrospect I think like 8 in

636
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:12,440
would have been this is 10 and 1

637
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:14,479
12 which unfortunately you can kind of

638
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:24,030
see from the

639
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:24,030
[Music]

640
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:35,000
top we're getting super so Clos I

641
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,000
can I can feel it

642
00:45:40,340 --> 00:46:01,329
[Music]

643
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:07,838
good be careful car so remember you have

644
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:12,559
to listen to Nora okay see the

645
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,558
cars when Nora says stop what do you

646
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:17,318
do you have to stop right that's right

647
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,760
when

648
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:21,480
nor that's right so when Norris says

649
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,270
stop it's because it's dangerous and

650
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,639
there's a car okay

too okay

711
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,440
bye-bye so the last thing I'm going to

712
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,440
do is

713
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,679
put uh let's see if we can get some

714
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,599
rocks that I've been collecting from

715
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:52,000
around the

716
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:54,760
yard so there are spots where obviously

717
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,519
isn't flatten level so I'm going to take

718
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:02,920
some of this the soil from the yard I'll

719
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:04,239
uh break it down but uh build it up and

720
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,358
then basically

721
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:10,639
put kind of as much rock well once it's

722
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:15,519
built up but basically put Rocks Under

723
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:20,318
here so that uh the wood's not just

724
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:21,639
sitting straight on moist wet soil all

725
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:24,838
the

726
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:29,199
time so but yeah so I need to take I'm

727
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:32,119
going to put this in water and break it

728
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:35,239
down also get all the rocks out of it

729
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,559
and then the rocks will be used uh kind

730
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:40,199
of under

731
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:43,319
here and then we'll fill it with soil

732
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:45,798
and we'll be done but let's take a look

733
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:45,798
at our

734
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,920
handiwork yeah so what I was

735
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:57,479
saying so I'm going to sand

736
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:00,480
down like for example Le

737
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,960
here just that little Edge right there

738
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:08,119
and then I'll torch it again and then

739
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,119
here kind of where this sticks

740
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:15,559
out but I mean we got this thing is not

741
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:20,118
it's going to be

742
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:21,280
rugged we got some support there and

743
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:24,200
then on the

744
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,920
corners

745
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:29,719
uh I might put one here but I don't

746
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,720
really think I need

747
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,519
it but yeah that

748
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,000
is very

749
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,838
nice yeah so here we're just going to

750
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:51,838
put a whole bunch of these in the water

751
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,599
so I

752
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:58,279
can make it more like mud so I can

753
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:58,280
actually break it apart

754
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:05,599
and then that is going to build up some

755
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:09,400
of

756
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:12,240
these low points and then we'll put the

757
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,680
Rock in but like here yeah so basically

758
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:18,838
I need to level the whole thing that's

759
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,838
the next project level and get

760
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:26,079
rock

761
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:26,079
under uh the wood

762
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:31,920
yeah look at that boom all

763
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:39,639
right see yeah basically I have this uh

764
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:42,150
this low area here that I've been

765
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:43,598
filling in over time with

766
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:47,160
[Music]

767
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,960
biomass so I'm going to build this up

768
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,079
but then keep

769
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,559
going over

770
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:57,719

[Music]

774
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,440
scraps B I can only put so

775
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:09,480
much kitchen throughput through the worm

776
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,490
bins so I'm constantly looking

777
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,119
for places for the

778
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:17,289
[Music]

779
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:29,729

snails underneath and uh other stuff I

791
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:38,639

792
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:40,639
I'm going to fill it's going to I've

793

days so that's all crunchy throw that in

795
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:50,300
and then some of the soil from the

796
00:56:46,318 --> 00:57:29,889
pots and then we will plant some plants

797

804
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,838
4x8 over

805
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:46,440
here maybe two of them going that way

806
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:48,119

are going to go in here Australian

813
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:15,119

817
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:24,960
gone all right

818
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:36,119
so this is definitely a male cuz I

819
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:38,358
revegged it and then this is a cutting

820
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:41,480
from it just in

821
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:44,598

822
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:46,679
more I have a whole bunch of other

823
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:51,000
seeds we're going to do a seed increase

824
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:51,000
of the Australian bastard cannabis

825
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:58,200

weeks later this is the end

833
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:23,679
result we

834
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:23,679
got the hexagon around the

835
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,920
tree we got

836
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:35,078
the

837
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:36,200
rectangle and then right here we're

838
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:40,079
going

839
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:44,679
to do some other random

840
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:46,318
shape and now I'm trying to uh I'm going

841
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:49,318
to cut down some

842
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:53,318
bamboo and basically create

843
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:57,079
staks and uh create some height and

844
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:58,920
structure so some of the viny stuff like

845
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:04,240
the

846
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:05,838
uh the Morning Glory can climb and then

847
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:09,558
I have these

848
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:13,440
little pieces of uh branch that

849
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:18,760
I've kind of created a little ladder so

850
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,760
they can plants can VY plants can grab

851
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:23,639
on

852
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:28,880
anyway for
