00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,560
what's up fcp community this is

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,559
lobsterfam farms here going to go

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,919
through my process of how i harvest for

4
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,759
fresh frozen

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,439
now one thing to take into consideration

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,759
before you start harvesting a large

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,278
amount for fresh frozen

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,879
you want to do at least some small

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,118
amount of testing to know that you're

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,719
going to be happy with the quality or

11
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,719
with the yield of the material you're

12
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,559
working it's really a crap shoot you

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,839
might think it's going to dump and

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,559
you're going to have a winner but it's

15
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,039
better to be safe and do a test first

16
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,359
now my buddy who's a hash wizard he

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,879
tested this one this is the hella jelly

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,799
and it seemed like it wasn't wasn't

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,040
quite to the yield that we'd typically

20
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,640
be looking for but the quality was

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,159
really really good and unique where

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,679
we're going to run it at least once and

23
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,319
see what it does

24
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,799
so he described it as some grape soda

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
kind of grape jelly terps and it sounded

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,558
real fun and uncommon for what's

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,359
available in solvent list today so we

28
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,359
decided to run it

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,480
now there's a couple ways to test i'm

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,920
far from an expert on this but from what

31
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:08,640
i've seen you put x amount of grams into

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,560
a mason jar with ice give it a vigorous

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,560
shake for x amount of time and then kind

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
of just visually inspect

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,320
i think you want to see something along

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,040
a disco ball i'm not quite sure how to

37
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,798
judge the amount i'm more so on this

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,439
side of the process just getting it to

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,360
be frozen but a more advanced and new

40
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,639
way to check is a device called the

41
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,719
resin dial from dude simply adam and

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,239
that really seems like a game changer

43
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,679
i'm not sure on the price of them but i

44
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,359
would definitely look into it if you're

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,200
going to try to commit a large batch to

46
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,560
fresh frozen in this way you could have

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,478
some solid data before you proceed

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,840
things that you will need

49
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:48,560
an ice cold freezer two if possible

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,640
a pair of clean sharp scissors

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
a clean work area

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,399
packages to put your material in

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,079
a marker to clearly label your packages

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,079
and a scale to measure your weight

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,840
almost ready for harvest couple more

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
things to consider are we going to be

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,598
harvesting the whole plant for fresh

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,640
frozen are we going to be taking the

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,560
tops for flower are we going to be able

60
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,639
to move the entire plant to our

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,878
workspace or are we going to have to

62
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,359
take branches or little pieces up to the

63
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:24,000
workspace to work on individually these

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,480
all have advantages and disadvantages

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,039
since i know that this isn't the highest

66
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,079
yielding i took most of the tops for

67
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,000
flower

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,160
i then let the bottoms bulk up for

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,598
another week so they got to crank on

70
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,039
some more weight and really put on some

71
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,560
more resin

72
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,639
usually i would have to bring these up

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
branch by branch which isn't ideal

74
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,679
because i feel like whatever container

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,360
you put them in or however you transport

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,439
them just the weight of the flowers

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,040
themselves and the little micro climate

78
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,359
that they might create could start

79
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,759
degrading the resin right there so

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,000
situationally i was able to bring these

81
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,799
up here

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,280
[Music]

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,280
let's get going

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
i'm going to take a piece

85
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,639
get it to the work area

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,519
now this is where it becomes a little

87
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,518
bit more of an art than a science

88
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,360
i think most of us can agree that you

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
want to touch the flower

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,280
as little as possible so it's good to

91
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,799
use the stem

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
is the only way to kind of maneuver it

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,599
around

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,080
i like to start by getting most of the

95
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,878
big leafs off

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,959
so then you can kind of assess the rest

97
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,518
of the flower from there

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,920
now each genetic

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,640
and each person's preference is going to

100
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,119
dictate that it's a little different

101
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,958
this is just my style

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,799
for this genetic

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,799
you can see on the underneath there's a

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,879
good amount of resin there so you'll

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
want to check underneath as well as

106
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,318
don't just look on the top and think oh

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,199
that leaf looks bare because it might be

108
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,199
coated underneath

109
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,000
so for me for this genetic it's going to

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,840
end up looking something about that

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
bring it over here

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,959
i've seen some techniques where people

113
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,040
will have a stainless steel table and

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,959
then kind of use a magnet

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
to drop the material into there as

116
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,599
they're bucking it down which i think is

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,519
awesome my situation doesn't allow that

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,479
so i prefer to use an aluminum turkey

119
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,560
tray

120
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,560
because aluminum has a slightly negative

121
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,879
static electrical charge

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,839
and it kind of makes the resin

123
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,839
not want to stick there

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,080
you're going to keep bucking it down

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,000
until you get to your desired weight

126
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,359
it's good to keep track so you know like

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,519
kind of what percentage you're getting

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,120
if that matters to you at all i like to

129
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,159
measure them in pounds

130
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,240
so i'm gonna keep going branch by branch

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,960
until i get to a pound

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,960
i'll see you guys in a minute

133
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:24,478
[Music]

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,240
so we've got to our desired weight um

135
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,800
there's many different containers you

136
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,960
can use some people like turkey bags so

137
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,520
it can breathe a little some like a half

138
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,719
gallon bags just out of convenience i

139
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,198
prefer a vaccio bag i like to

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
get it in there as gently as possible

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,319
and then i'll put it in the first

142
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,478
freezer

143
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,719
about an hour or so before it goes into

144
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,120
the main freezer the thought process

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,039
behind that is to not have it be room

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,720
temperature or too warm when it's going

147
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,279
in the second freezer the long-term

148
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,680
storage so that it's not making the

149
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,839
motor in the freezer have to flux up and

150
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,000
down and it's not like giving little

151
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,599
warm pockets to other

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,839
units that are in there like if you put

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
a warm unit on top of a frozen one it

154
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,519
might just kind of change the

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
temperature inside the other turkey bag

156
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,478
and give some moisture that's not ideal

157
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
so

158
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,639
i like to start seal them store them in

159
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,639
one freezer for an hour and then move

160
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,319
them to long term

161
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,800
so we have our amount laid out

162
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,120
we have our turkey or our uh

163
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,639
vac sealed bag clearly labeled

164
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
because it's hard to tell after they're

165
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,000
frozen and it's easier for whoever's

166
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,399
gonna make it whether that be you or

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,399
someone else

168
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,800
get it in there as gently as we can

169
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,519
i like to suck just a little bit of the

170
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,759
air out but not squish it at all and

171
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,758
then seal

172
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,439
so we're going to take out our last one

173
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,478
that we did

174
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,478
about an hour ago

175
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000
put the second new one in

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,399
last step on my part i'm going to take

177
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,680
the one that's been in the first freezer

178
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,598
for an hour and then put it in the

179
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,959
long-term freezer until i get it over to

180
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:27,399
the hashmaker

181
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,399
so my duties are essentially done

182
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,478
all right then thanks for hanging out

183
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,239
through some of the harvest i hope

184
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,758
everyone out there can enjoy fresh

185
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,280
frozen

186
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,720
stay cool

187
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,719
back to you future cannabis project
