1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:08,640

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,198
day 40 day

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,599
49 and this is the two this is the

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,560
one this is the

8
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:29,560
five

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,559
four 68

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,320
and the

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:43,079
nine and everything starting to finish

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,079
up for real these are like the

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,140
smallest is out here where there's not

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,399
as much light but it's

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,359
[Music]

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,679
still still throwing some nice

17
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,679
resing number four

18
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,158
the number four and the number five and

19
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,560
the number one are all the same pretty

20
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,759
much just varying degrees in the

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,159
nose and then the number six and the

22
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:18,359
number eight are similar only the six

23
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,320
smells similar to the one and two and

24
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,239
and

25
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:27,438
four and then the nine is just the

26
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:30,759
standout as far as Aroma and even in

27
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:34,599
resin profile

28
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,879
but yeah this is the entire batch and as

29
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:41,319
you can see mainly shorter ones except

30
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,319
for the two taller and then the mid

31
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,798
sizee yeah that's all we got going here

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,079
nice

33
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,560
maturity for week

34
00:01:51,078 --> 00:02:00,438
7 should be looking at a week9 finish

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,439
maybe a little bit later we'll see
