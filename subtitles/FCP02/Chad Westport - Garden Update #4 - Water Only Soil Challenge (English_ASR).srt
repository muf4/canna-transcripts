hi everybody chad westport here we are

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,079
back for week four of the garden update

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
now i've already had kind of a peek

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,598
inside but i want to let you guys know

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,839
that the light has not moved since last

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,200
week so that's a good way to judge the

10
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:35,840
growth over this last week let's go in

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,840
and take a look

12
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,728
[Music]

13
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,479
again these are being grown under the

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,959
spider farmer s e 5000 light that you

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,479
see right there let's take a look at the

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,799
plants and see what they've done since

17
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,679
the last week oh we should probably look

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:59,839
at them last week

19
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,840
and now here they are this week

20
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,478
that one's touching the light look at

21
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,560
that

22
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,560
big growth on these ladies

23
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,158
okay so again week four and you might

24
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,239
notice that we're down to six plants uh

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,320
everything is showing their sex

26
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,280
uh the two

27
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,719
goji og times local skunks both turned

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
out to be male

29
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,560
so those are gone

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,359
and earlier the two burgers and beers

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,000
turned out to be male so those are gone

32
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:37,280
so what we've got left right now are the

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,959
roadkill skunk time space cheese by mr

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,000
toad we've got the purple pineapple from

35
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,078
the ranch and we've got kool-aid man

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,478
from bee leaf cannabis

37
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,879
uh let's go in and take a closer look at

38
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,599
each of the plants so this girl just

39
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,438
exploded up uh this is in the

40
00:01:53,599 --> 00:02:00,718
appalachian supply soil this is the fat

41
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:04,559
leafed kool-aid man and uh yeah she's

42
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,239
looking green she's looking great

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,479
no complaints here

44
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,239
moving on we've got the thinly version

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,879
of the kool-aid man back here from bee

46
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,920
leaf cannabis and this one is in the

47
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,079
sohom living soil and it's got kind of a

48
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,919
cool fasciation going i'll show you that

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,239
real quick you can see the stem right

50
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,878
there how it's extra thick then it just

51
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,280
kind of comes up and it oh it does its

52
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,359
own little split right there oh get that

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,199
out of the way so it decided to split

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
it's going into two more

55
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,399
and uh this will be exciting to see how

56
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,238
this one grows out so yeah and and i've

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,239
noticed too on the sohum you know again

58
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,000
it's got a lot of good food in it

59
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,680
but i am getting a little bit of tip

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,239
burns uh but overall the growth is you

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,040
know growth is good just a little bit of

62
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,360
tip burn on this one next up is the

63
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,840
roadkill skunk time space cheese this is

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,080
the taller thinly fino that i got from

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,400
mr toad and it is actually starting to

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,800
bud up pretty darn early and this is in

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,158
the sohom living soil let's go in a

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,319
closer look yeah that's starting to put

69
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,399
on some nice buds nice and early

70
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,878
starting out good got a lot of tops on

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,120
it and you know again this too a little

72
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,840
bit of tip burn a little bit of tip burn

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,599
it's in the soham living soil and as you

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,840
can see from the growth plenty of juice

75
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,798
all right moving on from the thin one

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,519
to the short wide leaf roadkill skunk

77
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,280
time space cheese from mr toad that i've

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,120
shown him and asked about he said this

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,719
is an outlier so again i'm pretty

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,599
excited to have an ancestor genetic

81
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,080
popping up in my tent from that roadkill

82
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,759
skunk space cheese combo let's go in for

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,959
a close look and see how big those leafs

84
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,878
are man damn big leaf right there it's a

85
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,519
three-inch sticker guys

86
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,359
so yeah i'm really excited to see what

87
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,158
this one's gonna do for me and so this

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,720
is sitting in the kiss organics biochar

89
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,479
soil and if you guys watch the first

90
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,519
update i don't think there's any doubt

91
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,479
that this is the mvp comeback of the

92
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,120
tent so far so yeah looking good doing

93
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,919
good stoke to see what comes of it

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,799
moving on and right here we've got the

95
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:16,560
purple pineapple from the ranch and this

96
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,959
too is in the kiss organics biochar soil

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,839
uh everything's looking good and green

98
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,560
and lush on this plant starting to throw

99
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,159
out its pistols i can't wait to see how

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
it finishes up

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,439
let's go over to it's sister all right

102
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,000
over to the sister right here and the

103
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,639
sister is sitting in the sohom living

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,040
soil and again nice short profile

105
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,199
starting to throw pistols uh very

106
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,520
similar to the growth of the kiss

107
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,000
organics but this one is in the sohum

108
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,399
living soil a little more profile of

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,879
this one as it goes down i might need to

110
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,679
do a little defoliation down there but

111
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,879
overall she's looking good nice short

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,800
stout stocky plant all right so let's

113
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,879
recap you know i keep saying week four

114
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
but really it's garden update number

115
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,959
four

116
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,198
uh it's in the third week of it being in

117
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,599
these seven gallon containers

118
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,000
and it is the second beginning of the

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,840
second week of flowering so that's kind

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,918
of the time schedule it's good to know

121
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,959
so we can see when and if these run out

122
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,560
of juice

123
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,560
but also to let you guys kind of know

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,120
what stage of flowering they're in and

125
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
you know what kind of results to expect

126
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,959
