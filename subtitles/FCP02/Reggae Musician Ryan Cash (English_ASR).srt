um your vocals have a slightly

469
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,320
a dissonant quality that is yet soothing

470
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,319

intending

731
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,798

732
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,519
him and gabe both of them know what they

733
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,359

735
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:37,759

about that collab yeah

809
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,720
and

810
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,959
how long did it take you to write that

811
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,558
whole album by the way

812
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,720

smoke one no

815
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,439
it didn't take me long

816
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,600
because

817
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,038
the reason why i didn't take my lung is

818
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,359
add

819
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:47,278
one song already written

820
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,278
so i only had nine more to go

821
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,119

823
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,639
and then

824
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,278

825
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,278
production part together getting all the

826
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,319

828
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,759
