2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,080
what's up travis welcome to the lab

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,519
good welcome to mcr labs um

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,919
grant hill the business development

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,879
manager here um we're excited to give

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,399
you a little

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,879
idea of what we're doing in our happy

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,518
little house here up in gardner maine um

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,759
so why don't we get scanned in and pop

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,759
right back awesome behind the scenes

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,760
tour

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,559
howdy welcome to mcr labs this is our

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,399
little home here in gardner maine so

14
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,078
starting this first little room what we

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,600
have is all of our like information

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,039
technology for

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
data analysts

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,800
uh data analysis

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,879
and then over

20
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,238
here a little schedule for internal lab

21
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,718
jazz

22
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,558
stuff to be clean we just got this new

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,879
thermocycler in which we're very excited

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,640
about for hotline sex testing which

25
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,000
should be available within the month

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,799
um so that's what's going on here

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,040
uh as we move on into the lab

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,040
we

29
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,438
over there for our sample prep

30
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,679
and then

31
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,798
as things come into the lab to walk you

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,118
kind of

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,400
one by one through it we come in here

34
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,478
this is

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,719
our sample prep room the weight road

36
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,039
room so samples get stored in these

37
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,519
security containers and then are brought

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,200
over these stations to be weighed out

39
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,158
and prepped out for their subsequent

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,880
tests

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,759
so as those move along they come out to

42
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:51,438
the bench where they are then prepped by

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,040
our awesome lab analysts um

44
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,639
and we have

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
jared

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,959
page

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,920
and then

48
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,438
as we go along here we have

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
the

50
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,478
hplc which is what you're going to be

51
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,878
running all of what we are running all

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,400
of our cannabinoid tests on

53
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,479
um we run a 1990s

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,840
yes

55
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,919
and then

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,840
so that's this

57
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,839
everything runs live over here

58
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,959
all right so along with the heavy metals

59
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,518
testing that we carry out on the icp ms

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,439
we also run plant nutrient analysis this

61
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,959
is a really great tool for a grower to

62
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,719
diagnose problems with their plant

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,479
before they become apparent

64
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,080
a lot of really highly skilled growers

65
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,439
know exactly what they're looking for

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,400
when they're looking at their plant they

67
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,159
can say oh we have deficiencies with xyz

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,080
but if you use plant nutrient analysis

69
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,799
you're able to actually catch these

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000
deficiencies or toxicities before they

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,599
become

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,439
symptomatic before they display on your

73
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,839
plant that's going to really allow you

74
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,919
to prevent any risk of decreased health

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,439
rate for your plant and then on top of

76
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,039
that we all know that strains feed

77
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,878
really differently you might have one

78
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,039
strain that pulls up fertilizer at a

79
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,318
crazy rate compared to another one

80
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,639
if you're running plant nutrient

81
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,719
analysis you can say hey my plant has

82
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,878
these certain elements at the exact

83
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,318
ranges i want them to be at i could save

84
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,239
a little bit of money i can cut back on

85
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,560
a feed on this one versus hey this guy's

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,400
really hungry i need to pump up cal mag

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
i need to pump up etc

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
and then lastly we have a lot of

89
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,919
elements that are considered mobile or

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,680
immobile so certain things like a

91
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,518
phosphorus the plant can actually

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,200
relocate within its tissues so if

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,560
there's a deficiency in a leaf it's

94
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,719
going to pull phosphorus from another

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,479
leaf and bring it over to there but you

96
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,639
have elements like calcium that are

97
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,199
known as immobile and these only move

98
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,119
through the plant with transpiration

99
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,479
so say you're following a vpd chart you

100
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,319
think you're right on there but maybe

101
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,479
it's a little too humid and your plants

102
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,079
are kind of water locked you might see

103
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,840
they're a little bit water bound you got

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
curling leaves etc

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,360
you run plant nutrient analysis and you

106
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,119
realize hey my young tissue doesn't have

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,760
calcium but i've been feeding calcium

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
like crazy that lets you in to kind of

109
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,560
an understanding of what's going on with

110
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,679
your environmentals maybe you need to

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
look at your a-trap a little more

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
carefully

113
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,959
all right so here we have our microbiol

114
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,318
lab this is sort of isolated from the

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,519
rest of the lab and here's where we're

116
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,759
going to be working with samples that

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,399
might have microbial contaminants or

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,560
even potentially pathogenic microbes

119
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,799
we want to start over here we have the

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,240
area where we're running qpcr

121
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,639
and this is for detection of those

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,160
really dangerous pathogenic organisms

123
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,240
these are going to be things like shiga

124
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120
toxin producing

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
enterobacters like really bad e coli and

126
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,319
salmonella

127
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,919
so essentially what happens here is

128
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,839
we'll take a sample

129
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,519
it will be put into an enrichment broth

130
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,198
and then it'll go into an incubator for

131
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,198
a set amount of time

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,120
and what this is doing is enriching any

133
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,400
presence of those potentially pathogenic

134
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,840
microbes to the point where we're

135
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,198
guaranteed to detect them with our

136
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,198
instrument

137
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,720
because these are one cfu per gram we

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,240
really need to do that step to grow it

139
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,160
out because we want to be extremely

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,759
confident that we're going to capture it

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
once the sample has been adequately

142
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
enriched we load it into a block and it

143
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
goes into this lovely automated

144
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
instrument and this instrument is pretty

145
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,639
much responsible for setting up our pci

146
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,080
plates

147
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,918
pcr is a molecular base detection screen

148
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,000
that's looking for target

149
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,680
strands of dna that are associated with

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,038
what causes these organisms to be

151
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,439
dangerous

152
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,759
so for us we're looking at genes that

153
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,439
are responsible for the toxin producing

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,038
i just like to prepare this fresh mobile

155
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,759
phase so

156
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,279
bubble base is sort of like the blood of

157
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
this instrument here and it carries a

158
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,799
sample through from the liquid form it

159
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,959
allows it to be separated out and

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,280
analyzed and so it runs through the

161
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,599
entire system it's red in this detector

162
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,159
system down here and then once it's been

163
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,000
read it's now considered waste so

164
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,240
this is the waste bucket which is the

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,399
solvent after it's been analyzed

166
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,800
awesome

167
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:59,599
hplc

168
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,960
yep um so then this is our gc fid which

169
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,840
we run uh our terpene analysis on as

170
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,719
well as our

171
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,719
residuals residual solvent analysis

172
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,839
for sure yeah so

173
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,840
this is kind of comprehensive gc system

174
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,599
so we have our headspace injector system

175
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,839
over here this is where the residual

176
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,560
solvent test on and so we just have a

177
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,560
quad sample into a glass vial it's

178
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,038
heated up in the oven and then analyzed

179
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,240
through the column with the um flame

180
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,759
ionization detector id

181
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,519
and we use a similar system but it's

182
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,160
called the liquid injection system so we

183
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,879
actually use solvent and that's uh

184
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,280
that's for our terpenes analysis

185
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,038
and we get an extract put into one of

186
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,559
these little vials

187
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,879
and then we have a friend in here which

188
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,079
samples takes one microliter very very

189
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,759
small amount

190
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,839
eats it up and vaporizes it turns into

191
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,000
the gas and that's analyzed through the

192
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,159
same column system

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,038
as individual solvents

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,120
and

195
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,639
basically instead of

196
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,199
a liquid bubble phase like liquid

197
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,960
chromatography we use carrier gaps we

198
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,360
have our gas

199
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,598
system up here we pull gas from

200
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,000
loaded downstairs these large tanks and

201
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:17,439
that's brought up that pressure here

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,519
and we use a something like a gas matrix

203
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,279
that samples analyzer so

204
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,478
that's

205
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,478
how the gc operates

206
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,720
the last machine we have here is the ic

207
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,560
pms

208
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
which is the machine that we run heavy

209
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,759
metals on um and joe do you feel

210
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,758
comfortable talking about that as well

211
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,240
yep we run heavy metals and plant

212
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,439
nutrition on this instrument here

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,879
um

214
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,478
that's for the leaf analysis as well

215
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,478
yeah exactly yep so kind of the the way

216
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,680
this works on nutshell is we use nitric

217
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,519
acid to digest the sample so this is an

218
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
inorganic chemistry test and so we're

219
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,758
basically taking

220
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,439
sample breaking it down to its like

221
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
elemental atomic

222
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,439
we break it down to its atoms digesting

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120
with acid

224
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,959
and then we run it through

225
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,280
plasma torch that's what it's called so

226
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,638
it actually use argon gas

227
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,598
and it

228
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,400
heats up and it ionizes

229
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,240
the atoms and once the atom has a charge

230
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,799
and it's been ionized it's sent through

231
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,519
the quadrupole detector and that's sort

232
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,918
of where non-charged ions

233
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:27,279
aren't considered for analysis and the

234
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,719
charge that is we're looking for the um

235
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,519
so in this case we're looking for

236
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,278
charged metallic ions so say lead or

237
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,559
iron or

238
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,240
cadmium

239
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,000
the analytes of interest will be charged

240
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
and analyzed and

241
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
the way the magnet works is sent

242
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,158
straight through the detector and that

243
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,000
spec is able to quantify based on the

244
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,879
mass of cherry ratio

245
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,720
so

246
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,240
this does gives us total counts of atoms

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,080
it's a pretty

248
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,480
pretty unique very

249
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,160
technically advanced system um is that

250
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
something in common in the cannabis

251
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,039
testing industry so far

252
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,720
so metals testing will is required with

253
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,159
that machine specifically yeah so you

254
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,519
can um

255
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,838
there's a few different instruments you

256
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,959
can use there's

257
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,000
atomic absorption system that's a bit

258
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,239
simpler

259
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,600
the icpms is probably

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,680
the standard of what you want to be

261
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,240
using um i think you can use a triple

262
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,359
quad system as well but the

263
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,519
7700 7800 magellan are become the

264
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,000
standard icpms and that's

265
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,000
that's definitely like a step above the

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,080
atomic absorption method which is sort

267
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,080
of the base level for those tests

268
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,639
yep

269
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,039
all right so along with the heavy metals

270
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,679
testing that we carry out on the icpms

271
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,599
we also run plant nutrient analysis this

272
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,120
is a really great tool for a grower to

273
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,879
diagnose problems with their plant

274
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,639
before they become apparent

275
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,240
a lot of really highly skilled growers

276
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,519
know exactly what they're looking for

277
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,560
when they're looking at their plant they

278
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,320
can say oh we have deficiencies with xyz

279
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,239
but if you use plant nutrient analysis

280
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,959
you're able to actually catch these

281
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,159
deficiencies or toxicities before they

282
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,759
become

283
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,600
symptomatic before they display on your

284
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,000
plant that's going to really allow you

285
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
to prevent any risk of decreased health

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,600
rate for your plants and then on top of

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
that we all know that strain speed

288
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,040
really differently you might have one

289
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
strain that pulls up fertilizer at a

290
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,480
crazy rate compared to another one

291
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,800
if you're running plant nutrient

292
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,800
analysis you can say hey my plant has

293
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,958
these certain elements at the exact

294
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,479
ranges i want them to be at i could save

295
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,399
a little bit of money i can cut back on

296
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
a feed on this one versus hey this guy's

297
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,480
really hungry i need to pump up cal mag

298
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,079
i need to pump up etc

299
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,000
and then lastly we have a lot of

300
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,078
elements that are considered mobile or

301
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
immobile so certain things like a

302
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,599
phosphorus the plant can actually

303
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,360
relocate within its tissues so if

304
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,639
there's a deficiency in a leak it's

305
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
going to pull phosphorus from another

306
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,480
leaf and bring it over to there

307
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,480
but you have elements like calcium that

308
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,519
are known as immobile and these only

309
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
move through the plant with

310
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,278
transpiration

311
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,639
so say you're following a vpd chart you

312
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,480
think you're right on there but maybe

313
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,639
it's a little too humid and your plants

314
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,240
are kind of water locked you might see

315
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,000
they're a little bit water bound you got

316
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,759
curling leaves etc

317
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,519
you run plant nutrient analysis and you

318
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,200
realize hey my young tissue doesn't have

319
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,919
calcium but i've been feeding calcium

320
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,278
like crazy that lets you in to kind of

321
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,719
an understanding of what's going on with

322
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,838
your environmentals maybe you need to

323
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,240
look at your a-track a little more

324
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,240
carefully

325
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,120
all right so here we have our microbiol

326
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,399
lab this is sort of isolated from the

327
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,679
rest of the lab and here's where we're

328
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,919
going to be working with samples that

329
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,559
might have microbial contaminants or

330
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,639
even potentially pathogenic microbes

331
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,199
you want to start over here we have the

332
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,639
area where we're running qpcr and this

333
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,120
is for detection of those really

334
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,799
dangerous pathogenic organisms these are

335
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,399
going to be things like shiga toxin

336
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,278
producing

337
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,879
enterobacters like really bad e coli and

338
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,399
salmonella

339
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,879
so essentially what happens here is

340
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,639
we'll take a sample it will be put into

341
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,320
an enrichment broth and then it'll go

342
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,360
into an incubator for a set amount of

343
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
time

344
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,278
and what this is doing is enriching any

345
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,480
presence of those potentially pathogenic

346
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,000
microbes to the point where we're

347
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,360
guaranteed to detect them with our

348
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,360
instrument

349
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
because these are one cfu per gram we

350
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,320
really need to do that step to grow it

351
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,319
out because we want to be extremely

352
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,839
confident that we're going to capture it

353
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,760
once the sample has been adequately

354
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,279
enriched we load it into a block and it

355
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,319
goes into this lovely automated

356
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:23,519
instrument

357
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
this instrument is pretty much

358
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,720
responsible for setting up our pcr

359
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,278
plates

360
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,240
pcr is a molecular-based detection

361
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,000
screen

362
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,079
that's looking for target

363
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,839
strands of dna that are associated with

364
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,120
what causes these organisms to be

365
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,600
dangerous

366
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,600
so for us we're looking at genes that

367
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,759
are responsible for the toxin producing

368
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,440
elements of these bacteria as well as

369
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,480
the proteins that let them bind to the

370
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,399
gut

371
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,320
so if we have a bacteria that produces

372
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,919
toxins but won't necessarily stick to

373
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,278
your stomach you'll be able to pass that

374
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,240
you won't run into horrible medical

375
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:55,838
issues

376
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,839
if you have any cola that sticks to your

377
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,680
stomach when it doesn't produce toxins

378
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,360
you're also totally healthy there so

379
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,039
that's why our qpcr screen is really

380
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
looking for those pathogenic genes in

381
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,199
particular to make sure that you have

382
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,800
the safest product possible

383
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,120
so aside from our presence absence

384
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,159
screens we also do some quantitative

385
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,759
assays

386
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,078
these are things like your total aerobic

387
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,600
count your total yeast and mold or your

388
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,479
enterobacter

389
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,159
for that we use the bio u tempo system

390
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,240
which is a really user friendly and high

391
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,480
throughput system that takes what is

392
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,320
known as most probable number testing

393
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,000
and it puts it into these really small

394
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,839
cassettes that are super easy to handle

395
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,120
and work with

396
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,720
so essentially what we see in this

397
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,879
cassette is really similar to like a

398
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,639
growth plate where you would see

399
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,759
you take your sample apply it to a grow

400
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,440
media and then you're going to count

401
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,958
what grows out

402
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,480
we start to take away the guesswork

403
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,399
there so if you have a tech that's

404
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,759
manual you counting those

405
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,240
organisms it might be a little less

406
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,120
accurate because we have an automated

407
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
system

408
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,320
we really take all the human error out

409
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,079
of that

410
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,839
this is useful for counting things that

411
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,838
have action limits

412
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,839
so organisms like total yeast and mold

413
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,120
or total aerobic count bacteria have a

414
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,920
higher action limit than the more

415
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,198
dangerous ones like the enterobacter

416
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,278
this is because those things like

417
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,198
enterobacter are associated with things

418
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,198
like fecal borne illnesses

419
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,879
viruses pathogenic organisms that are

420
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,120
going to make you really sick

421
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,399
things like total aerobic or total yeast

422
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,278
and mold these are slightly less

423
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
innocuous so they have a higher limit

424
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,000
that being said you don't want to have

425
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,919
something that's outrageous because that

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,759
can be harmful both to the consumer and

427
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,039
to the individual who's working and we

428
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,278
don't want people to be sitting in a

429
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,719
trim room handling extremely moldy

430
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,198
cannabis over time because that can lead

431
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,639
to chronic health issues

432
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,639
that's essentially our microbiol suite
