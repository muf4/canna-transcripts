the session we are trying to keep this

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,340

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,120
what's going on in the documentary next

102
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,620
is uh Kevin sorakowski

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,959
um he actually represents appreciation

104
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,060
extraction but has more recently gone

105
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,399
into Consulting

106
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,139
um very familiar with that and he has a

107
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,819
plethora of information again love his

108
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,800
angle and his perspective on some

109
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,439
insight uh throughout the documentary

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,720
then we have Corey xyla who is with

111
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,160
Tioga greens another interesting story

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,979
these individuals are coming from all

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,100
different angles of this community uh

114
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:46,620
for specifically Corey owns a dispensary

115
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,419
right outside of the gateway to Yosemite

116
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,340
National Park here in California which

117
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,599
is pretty interesting and some of the

118
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,339
brands you represent and the people you

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,240
meet from around the world and you

120
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:58,500
touched on that as well Jason Washington

121
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,300
um I believe he might have his camera

122
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,560
off but I think he's hiding behind The

123
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,680
The J

124
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,240
um so Jason D Washington is with culture

125
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,160
um Beyond being a social Equity license

126
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,060
holder here in California he has a lot

127
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,020
of things going on the International

128
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,579
Space also has some presence in Montana

129
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:16,319
but a lot of great Insight on what's

130
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,659
going going on not just domestically but

131
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,180
abroad which he touched on as well in

132
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,539
this documentary last we have Jack

133
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,120
Grover who is our founder and CEO Grove

00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:28,978
bags again plethora of information and

135
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,660
background very passionate my just like

136
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:32,819
myself he actually started out as a

137
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,259
grower was so passionate about the plant

138
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,879
and wanting to support it it came up

139
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,620
with the technology we now offer today

140
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,199
in our packaging

141
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,240
um so stoked to have him on as well so

142
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,819
perfect we'll thank you all again for

143
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,900
being here and for several of you I know

144
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,699
you're probably familiar with the story

145
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,758
but I thought I'd kind of start off with

146
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,978
the the history of 420. and it hits a

147
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,860
little close to home for me uh being a

148
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:58,079
NorCal kid actually grew up first in

149
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,240
Marin County for those who don't know

150
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,000
that's actually Where it All Began so

151
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,860
420 started in San Rafael at San Rafael

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,660
High School uh if you're familiar with

153
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,160
the Bay Area essentially if you're in

154
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,900
San Francisco you'd cross over what we

155
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,660
call the gate or the Golden Gate Bridge

156
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,339
that's Marin County come into Marin and

157
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,699
you kind of Pop right into San Rafael

158
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:20,758
just north of Sausalito so great little

159
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,680
town this is back in 1971 a group of

160
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,919
five friends they catch up and hang out

161
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,060
the statue every day after school it

162
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,299
kind of ended up being a bit of an

163
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,339
adventure they do these uh these these

164
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,680
kind of safaris as they call them they

165
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,899
ended up coining them one of The Safaris

166
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,360
they got best known for is finding an

167

old uh grow operations out in Stetson

168
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,919
Beach on the hillside that supposedly an

169
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:46,139
individual is tied to I believe it was

170
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,939
the Coast Guard that had this little

171
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,460
grow up on the hill not far from his

172
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,500
office they never did find the Grove but

173
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,359
the rest is kind of history as far as

174
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,699
how one of the individuals end up

175
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,419
becoming a roadie for the Grateful Dead

176
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,400
in the 70s and then 420 ended up on a

177
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:04,799
flyer I want to say it was back in the

178
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,019
80s and uh and it just kind of

179
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,460
perpetuated from there so it's an

180
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:09,959
interesting past and and I think the

181
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,698
thing to call out is the fact that it's

182
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,079
it's very close to home as far as where

183
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,879
law the culture and craft is Right

184
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,639
Northern California everyone knows of

185
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,740
the Emerald Triangle that is Mendocino

186
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,019
Trinity and Humboldt counties

187
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,000
in my opinion I'm totally biased I think

188
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,098
the most beautiful side of California is

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,379
North of San Francisco from Stetson

190
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:30,300
Beach to Crescent Bay and that obviously

191
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,399
is where the triangle Falls in

192
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,538
um but 420 has really become recognized

193
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,698
not just domestically but

194
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:37,019
internationally and you guys saw the

195
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,699
footage and a few of you were there I

196
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,978
know Jason was there Corey was out there

197
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,139
I know some individuals made it out to

198
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,758
spanavus which is an annual

199
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,439
International event started out as a

200
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,020
protestable now it's a balance of

201
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,839
consumer and B2B that takes place out in

202
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:53,818
Barcelona Spain and it was interesting

203
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,219
to hear people reference and talk about

204
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,960
420 coming up is that something for

205
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,120
those that don't know it wasn't really

206
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,098
on International radar even a handful of

207
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,079
years ago you want to go over to Europe

208
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:06,659
you want to go over to Thailand or down

209
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,300
to South America and hear people that

210
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,580
were tied to this plant reference this

211
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,860
very popular domestic holiday that we

212
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:17,159
have so 420 has definitely come a long

213
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,840
way and so with this documentary and and

214
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,699
again we'll get further ads out later on

215
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,318
you know we felt that it was an ideal

216
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,060
time to actually launch this during 4

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,039
20. and while it talks a little bit more

218
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,680
so about the current state of our

219
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:31,318
community of this industry that is legal

220
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,299
cannabis it's still something that all

221
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,418
of us acknowledge as being that big day

222
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,278
every year so it felt just fitting again

223
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:40,379
when Strauss and I connected on on the

224
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:43,080
release date for it to literally be on

225
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,158
420 because so much goes on and all of

226
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,540
you know that I'm sure some of you are

227
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,338
going to New York for the big event out

228
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,299
there or going to Green Street out here

229
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,040
in LA

230
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,778
uh or maybe even you're going to hippie

231
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,120
Hill up in San Francisco which is one of

232
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,799
the longest running 420 festivals but

233
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,659
there's always something going on

234
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,838
but with that I kind of want to jump in

235
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:03,179
and I want to find out from our our

236
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,640
panelists I guess if you will kind of

237
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:08,099
what 420 means to you and then kind of

238
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,080
segue into that what got you into this

239
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,759
space what got you into this community

240
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,860
this industry what you're passionate

241
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,659
about and I think it's fair to start

242
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,940
with ladies first so maybe if we kick it

243
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,559
off with you Katie if that's okay hello

244
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,260
thank you so much for having me

245
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,778
definitely

246
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,600
um so it's really interesting 420 has

247
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:29,820
always meant a lot to me because it's my

248
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,100
little sister's birthday my parents

249
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,040
anniversary and then my other sister's

250
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,500
anniversary so even from like four years

251
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,699
old 420 was always a date that we really

252
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,860
celebrated

253
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,560
which is kind of fun that now I'm in the

254
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,560
industry and so I celebrate as well

255
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,759
I actually studied Theology and um

256
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,320
almost became a nun so my way into

257
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,939
cannabis is a little bit different than

258
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,640
probably most

259
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,760
um I was training for my second marathon

260
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,740
and um my first marathon I had a

261
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,980
terrible uh

262
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,740
time I mean it's just not something your

263
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,200
body is designed to do and I was having

264
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,259
um you know back pain knee pain all the

265
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,060
pains and um for my second Marathon I

266
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:17,639
was determined to not have as much

267
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,679
trouble as I had during my first so I

268
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,379
started to incorporate cannabis in my

269
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,039
recovery and started to actually uh you

270
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:25,500
know

271
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,519
formulate a plan for Recovery in my

272
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,860
training

273
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,959
and I started to make my own balms just

274
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,879
in my kitchen for myself

275
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,859
um and then you know do infusions of

276
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,659
essential oils and I did a bunch of

277
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,240
research and I watched like every

278
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,939
webinar every tutorial everything you

279
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,759
could possibly imagine and

280
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,680
um I literally was just making it for

281
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,559
myself I realized you could totally use

282
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,899
this to enhance your sexual experience I

283
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,239
tried it and it really worked but I was

284
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,940
using coconut oil as my base and coconut

285
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,100
oil isn't good for a lubricant so I

286
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,620
literally the next day went to three

287
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,180
dispensaries in my area to try to find a

288
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,639
product that would enhance my sexual

289
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,979
experience that wasn't coconut oil based

290
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,659
and it didn't exist

291
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,820
um so I just started making it for

292
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,199
myself in my kitchen and for friends of

293
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,700
friends and then

294
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
um all of a sudden somebody came up to

295
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,060
me and was like are you the weebu girl

296
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,480
and I was like

297
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,578
I am that's amazing this needs to be a

298
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,860
company like if if people are hearing

299
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:27,479
about the product and requesting it

300
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,399
um and then I just started out on this

301
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,800
journey to start a company that enhances

302
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,240
people's sex life through cannabis

303
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,159
and it's interesting that point because

304
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,740
like you said there's people don't

305
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,059
realize that this is uh medicine on so

306
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,700
many different levels I'm an avid

307
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:44,639
Advocate and as is I Know Jack and Corey

308
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,899
from a medicinal standpoint first but so

309
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,159
many different ways that it can be used

310
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,778
in so many different things that it

311
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,179
enhances I think people forget that it's

312
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:53,338
not all about the the psychological you

313
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:55,919
know there's so much more uh physically

314
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,839
that it can contribute to as far as a

315
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,979
better lifestyle so it's awesome to hear

316
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,360
and thank you for the back I love the

317
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,060
420 like you said you'll never forget

318
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,039
this day there's always something going

319
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,679
on for you right so I've been a good

320
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,879
segue then too uh is to Corey so Corey a

321
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,559
little bit of background you've got an

322
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,320
interesting one so definitely love to

323
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,539
hear yours as well yeah so

324
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,399
um 420 for me

325
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:19,019
um means a couple different things I

326
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,940
guess I'll start with the way I got into

327
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,578
cannabis first and that'll kind of play

328
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,100
my story into 420 for me

329
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,859
um I grew up skiing as a professional

330
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,079
athlete and when I was injured at age

331
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,379
around 14 I want to say in middle school

332
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:36,599
I broke my neck and I found out I was

333
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,778
allergic to opiates and as we all know

334
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,120
our country is the biggest uh pumper of

335
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:44,159
opiates and narcotics for pain instead

336
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,940
of resorting to the more holistic way of

337
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,219
things and so luckily my dad is a uh

338
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,200
he's a dentist and he has medical

339
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,420
background but he's definitely more of

340
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,519
the holistic way and definitely grew up

341
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,199
in the Grateful Dead area he's all peace

342
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,240
and love and has a lot of friends that

343
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,820
are have been in the Cannabis industry

344
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,579
forever and one of his friends just

345
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,160
always had suggested that I use low THC

346
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:11,099
High CBD for my pain and that's really

347
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,480
how I got into cannabis and um I also

348
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,639
noticed though that it really helped

349
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,379
with my mental psyche and just like

350
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,200
competing and stuff getting me in the

351
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:22,139
right State of Mind Muscle Recovery was

352
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,180
much faster just like Katie had said you

353
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,459
know I started using rubs back then for

354
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,439
pain relief and things like that just

355
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:31,259
making them at home like she said and

356
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,560
that's really where cannabis started for

357
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,838
me and just kind of really exploded from

358
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,359
there I saw the benefits of it and how

359
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,980
it helped people

360
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,899
and then after I kind of tapered out of

361
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,019
my skiing career I started a medical

362
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:48,000
cannabis doctor offices in remote places

363
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,679
and so I would work with like five

364
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,778
different doctors I'd set up satellite

365
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,939
offices and kind of started the future

366
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:55,500
of telemedicine and people being able to

367
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,839
get their recommendations in remote

368
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,059
towns so I learned a lot from all the

369
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,740
doctors and what different cannabinoids

370
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,439
and terpenes really help with different

371
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,600
ailments and things like that and so

372
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,399
I've kind of taken that side of things

373
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,339
and brought it into my dispensary like

374
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,019
Lance said which is and uh is located at

375
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:17,160
the end entrance to Yosemite National

376
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:20,159
Park right on Highway 395 and 120 and so

377
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,719
our whole program here is more about the

378
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,039
healing and helping of people and of

379
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
course we have products that get you

380
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,578
high as well but we're more of the

381
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,899
compassionate side and it's very

382
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:30,958
interesting like you'll see in the

383
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:33,120
documentary the doctors around here at

384
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,859
our hospitals and just main doctor

385
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,259
offices will actually send people to

386
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,180
come talk to me instead of prescribing

387
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,799
them Pharmaceuticals these days so it's

388
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,599
pretty cool that our community in these

389
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,338
little small towns have really looked

390
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,139
outside the box of the normal of just

391
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,660
prescribing pills and looking to more

392
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,980
holistic treatments for people it's

393
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:51,539
awesome you know we've helped a lot of

394
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,000
people have gone through

395
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:55,860
serious chronic pain to stage four

396
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,019
cancer we've had people that have been

397
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,600
able to recover from stage four cancer

398
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,578
and beat it using RSO in different

399
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,639
various ways

400
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:07,559
um yeah and then for 420 for me it

401
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,959
usually means nowadays a pretty crazy

402
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:13,078
day at our business but a time to give

403
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,759
back to our community so I love it um

404
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,859
I've got a good relationship with all of

405
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,338
our Brands and all of our brands have

406
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,199
been very supportive this year you know

407
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:23,579
they send us lots of products so it's

408
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:26,519
just a good time of year to really

409
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:28,439
support the people that support us and

410
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,060
you know if people don't have money on

411
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,440
that day we don't care you come in with

412
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,379
a dollar you're going to leave with a

413
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,139
fat bag of cannabis products and um yeah

414
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:38,759
it's just about giving back and

415
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:43,100
camaraderie between people and just

416
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,100
helping educate people and showing love

417
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,060
I'm gonna go the other extreme because

418
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:49,679
this is I love just to show the again

419
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:51,539
the diversity of everyone that was

420
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,519
involved in this documentary but natal

421
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:57,000
and I kind of joked around about it but

422
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,100
I mean honestly man like you come from a

423
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,198
totally different place but I know

424
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,420
passion in your association with the

425
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,399
plant played a role as well

426
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,259
yeah I mean I was kind of thinking about

427
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,899
that as a scores going over his

428
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,278
background I was like wow I I'm very on

429
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,740
the other side

430
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,139
um so yeah

431
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,899
I I thought about this question a lot

432
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,519
um like what 420 means to me and I guess

433
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,740
the first time I ever heard it was when

434
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,959
I was in college and

435
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,278
um and some guy's like dude it's 4 20

436
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,958
and I was like I have no idea what

437
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,578
you're talking about you know and so uh

438
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,099
it was it was very much back then

439
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:34,679
because it was like 15 years ago and

440
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,720
even in California 15 years ago uh

441
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,698
cannabis was still very deeply

442
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,778
stigmatized and and I was one of those

443
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,919
people on the other side of the fence

444
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:42,899
where I was like yeah I don't really

445
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,778
know and

446
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,879
um and the 420 number in me back then

447
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:49,439
kind of meant like

448
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,600
the the stigma that's still kind of

449
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,160
surrounds today like oh you know this

450
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,540
like illegal substance that's like

451
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,899
negative and has all these negative

452
00:16:54,539 --> 00:17:00,000
effects and over the course of you know

453
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,399
the past 15 years it's evolved for me

454
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,919
it's changed from

455
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,140
um oh that's what the guys in you know

456
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,579
High School do who like don't do it

457
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,140
don't get good grades right like I don't

458
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:12,480
hang out with those guys

459
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,059
um but then like as it evolved in

460
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,279
college I became much more familiar with

461
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:18,720
the plant and I actually ended up

462
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,039
preferring it more than alcohol when all

463
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,019
my friends were binge drinking and like

464
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,818
throwing up and like dying in the corner

465
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:25,259
uh I was like yeah I just want to like

466
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:27,599
chill you know this is what I think it's

467
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,160
useful for and then I'm a scientist so I

468
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,439
started looking into more of the science

469
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,480
behind it and I was like oh this is it's

470
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,400
actually very interesting and

471
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,140
and for the longest time

472
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,080
um I wanted to do something in the space

473
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,538
but uh when I thought of cannabis it was

474
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,399
like this illegal thing and I wasn't an

475
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:46,919
aerospace engineer like I worked at Nasa

476
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,538
like I can't you know I can't really

477
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,520
um you know go on to that other side of

478
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:52,259
the fence and

479
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,900
um and then when it became legal like

480
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:58,019
420 changed for me right it's no longer

481
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,179
like this thing that like is a taboo or

482
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,918
prohibited for me to engage in and then

483
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,759
a few years went by

484
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,200
um and I started this company and then I

485
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,339
was much more familiar with it I had

486
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,759
friends that were starting companies

487
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:13,678
around it and and then 420 now instead

488
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,919
of being this like negative connotation

489
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:20,038
it was a change in the Paradigm and an

490
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:23,100
opportunity to explore in new avenues

491
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:25,440
and now like when I look at cannabis

492
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:26,939
from a science perspective like I went

493
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,100
to the emerald science conference a few

494
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,259
weeks ago and

495
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:33,719
there's actual real science like being

496
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,640
done with cannabis and like quantitative

497
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,798
measure it's not

498
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,080
um we're no longer in the world of like

499
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,940
some guy who's like yo my indoors so

500
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,619
fire cures cancer it's like no like

501
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,038
they're actually testing synthetic

502
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:49,678
cannabinoids to like shrink tumor cells

503
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,900
so when I think of 420 now I don't think

504
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,120
of it's those guys in the back of the

505
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,620
class you know [ __ ] up it's like no

506
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,199
420 is

507
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,899
the future it's actually a completely

508
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,279
different perspective on how you can you

509
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,559
know build your life and how it'll

510
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,379
change other people's lives above and

511
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,519
beyond California United States globally

512
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,440
so

513
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,119
that's kind of my perspective when I

514
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,820
think of 420 I don't think about it

515
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:16,199
negatively I think about analysis it's a

516
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,899
positive future

517
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,580
and we've been I know we've done a few

518
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,019
of the canopac events together in in

519
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,480
year one individual that I can always

520
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:26,220
find next to the infused beverages along

521
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,480
with myself because I'm like you I kind

522
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,400
of I'm a little critical I know I'm

523
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,140
opinionated of it but I do reference

524
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,000
alcohol as poison but I also gave it up

525
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,520
as well I saw there no Health attributes

526
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,859
or anything that is beneficial to me so

527
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,599
I transition My Lifestyle as well you

528
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:41,399
know so I know we have always have that

529
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,019
kind of similarity but yeah you make a

530
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,160
valid point too there is um and I'll

531
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,339
have to share with you guys there's a

532
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,380
DOT org site and it has all studies on

533
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:50,699
record dating back to 1970. a lot of

534
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,320
them of course being private private

535
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,900
university because of the the position

536
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,119
of schedule one for the last several

537
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,519
decades but it's quite intriguing and to

538
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,678
your point Israel being the capital of

539
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,200
both science and medicine and going over

540
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,940
there and learning at the Cannabis in

541
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,919
Cancer University being myself a cancer

542
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,840
survivor hearing what they're doing to

543
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,320
your point at all the fact that they are

544
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,779
literally finding cultivar specific

545
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:18,839
solutions to combating certain cancerous

546
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,399
cells prostate colon and Brass being the

547
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,418
three cancers that they were targeting

548
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,460
because they're three of the biggest

549
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,320
Killers but seeing that they're actually

550
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,779
to your point being able to eradicate

551
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,399
those cells with cannabis blew my mind

552
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:30,599
and I say if I ever came out of

553
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,400
remission that's that's the first place

554
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,259
I was going to versus the the Western

555
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,640
medicine so I think it's awesome I

556
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,220
didn't hear that they're doing so much

557
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,880
research there like they even did a full

558
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,220
factorial study for insomnia where they

559
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:49,740
tested uh you know 600 different

560
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:52,259
combinations of THC CBD and CBN and it's

561
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,400
like that's real science like for me in

562
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,400
this industry that's what gets me

563
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,440
excited yeah 100 and again that's that's

564
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,059
another good transition to Jack and and

565
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,259
to be candid and most people that know

566
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,879
me in this industry in this community

567
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,379
I'm all about endorsing not just the

568
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,940
brands I believe in in the products and

569
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,679
solution but the people that are behind

570
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,200
it and I think that's a good segue to

571
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,580
you jack in in your background and what

572
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
motivates you to get into it and

573
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,538
obviously how you kind of had that pivot

574
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,880
and ideology towards cannabis many years

575
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:19,140
ago before getting into it so maybe if

576
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,720
you could share a bit of of your

577
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,000
background in that regard yeah um

578
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,500
absolutely Lance um

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,579
I like uh no tell from a pretty

580
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,960
anti-cannabis place and you know float

581
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:33,720
to look to the people using them like I

582
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,279
don't want to be like that that guy or

583
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,380
that that person

584
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,279
um it's a very very negative stereotype

585
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,080
very

586
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:42,720
um you know anti-intellectual

587
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,220
perspective on it um and then it really

588
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,259
wasn't until my brother went out to

589
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,779
whoever suffers from real severe

590
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,460
cerebral palsy went out to California

591
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,200
um and driving medical cannabis the

592
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,419
first time and got tremendous relief

593
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,460
from it that I really got interested in

594
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:59,520
and opened up my eyes to it so I've uh

595
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,319
was was growing in Ohio back when that

596
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,639
was you know probably worse than dealing

597
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,819
heroin

598
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,280
um I uh so I've been growing for uh just

599
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:10,200
before I had a driver's license

600
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,678
um and just been around the plan my my

601
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,419
whole life so for me 420 is really about

602
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,159
the patients the people who who truly

603
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,320
get you know who don't interests and

604
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,700
diet enjoy it or get anxiety relief from

605
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,798
it or a little bit of pain relief from

606
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,779
it like me because you know I've had

607
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,158
back surgery or spinal surgery and

608
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,759
everything else you know I certainly

609
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,980
consider myself patient but I think it's

610
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,079
the people who you know have had chronic

611
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,880
conditions whose life has been life

612
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,879
quality has been substantially improved

613
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,799
by our industry and the the people who

614
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,600
sacrifice a lot I mean you know we're

615
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,339
here you know being able to talk about

616
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,619
this on the internet and revealing our

617
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:48,000
faces and talk about the businesses that

618
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:49,798
we have and the exciting things we're

619
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,900
doing in the industry a lot of people

620
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,298
sacrifice a whole lot for us to be able

621
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,919
to have the the privilege to do that and

622
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:57,720
you know not not all of them you know

623
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,320
have straight great strains named after

624
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,360
them or are memorialized or have a great

625
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,298
legacy into today's industry you know

626
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,038
it's it's certainly not Steve D'Angelo

627
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:09,839
um you know who I'm talking about

628
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,339
um but it's it's it's countless people

629
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,379
who you know weren't just like

630
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,658
incarcerated or you know worked

631
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,280
tirelessly by the Midnight Oil to you

632
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,659
know create and innovate great products

633
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,158
that you know will bring a lot of help

634
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,780
and a lot of value to people like you

635
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,400
know Rick Simpson Oil or something some

636
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:25,918
of these other great things so that's

637
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,740
really what for 20 is to us at growth

638
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,480
bags and uh to me as somebody who you

639
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,400
know got interested in cannabis for for

640
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,558
those reasons obviously it's a huge part

641
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,240
of my everyday life now

642
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,399
um you know both professionally and

643
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,220
personally but uh that that's what we

644
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,159
try to focus on for for the holiday

645
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,380
awesome very good and I also want to

646

perspective and definitely some some

interesting intellect uh to the

650
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,440
conversation in the documentary but uh

the same question for you as well you

652
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,279
know a little bit about what 420 means

653
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,519
for you and how it impacts you and your

654
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,259
in your current life and in profession

um I I had kind of a funny uh entrance

658
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,960
into cannabis uh by happenstance uh

659
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,819
which would I guess we would call the

660
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,558
Legacy market now

661
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:19,019
um I had a friend that uh for whatever

662
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,579
set of reasons uh had some plants that

663
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:23,519
he was worried about keeping in his

664
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:25,980
house for uh another set of weeks right

665
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,139
so he called me and didn't want all that

666
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,640
work to go to waste and asked me if we

667
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,580
could throw them in my basement I said

668
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,620
sure why the hell not so we threw him in

669
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:38,099
my basement and um did a couple day

670
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:39,779
crash course on growing uh back where I

671
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:42,418
think I just watered it and dunked some

672
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,460
or tossed some super thrive on it

673
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,840
um but uh you know just started to

674
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,720
really kind of I would say at that point

675
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,459
I got re-interested in it um but I

676
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,519
dabbled a little bit in high school but

677
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,579
uh at the time whatever cannabis uh I

678
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,200
was getting uh wasn't really helping me

679
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,339
or affecting me in the way I wanted it

680
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,558
to it actually gave me a little bit of

681
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:03,240
anxiety and I didn't really like it

682
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:04,918
um you know looking back on that I think

683
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,140
it's because we've progressed so far and

684
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,419
now there's other options but it kind of

685
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,460
reinvigorated my passion for the plant

686
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:14,220
and kind of got me to try a few more

687
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,319
things uh you know try some new material

688
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,240
out you know gets

689
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,918
different consumption methods things of

690
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,599
that nature Edibles and and I really

691
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,520
found that

692
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,439
um for me it became this thing mentally

693
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,778
that was so important to me because um

694
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,460
you know a lot of people have body

695
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:30,960
ailments that they use it for different

696
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,819
objectives

697
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,860
um I haven't had those yet I'm starting

698
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:37,200
to feel them now at 35 but I've been

699
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:39,839
good so far so for me it was a mental

700
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,880
thing I I have an overactive mind and it

701
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,058
really kind of just allowed me to slow

702
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,640
down a bit so uh fast forward I ended up

703
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:50,099
starting a CBD business

704
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,659
um ran that for a bit and at the time my

705
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:53,099
friend Nick was uh starting a

706
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,559
Manufacturing Company Precision

707
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:57,119
extraction Solutions uh he asked me to

708
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,798
come on board as like the fifth or sixth

709
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,739
employee and uh kind of built the

710
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,720
company from there and fast forward I I

711
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,579
started branching out getting involved

712
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,558
in some retail and some other parts of

713
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:10,918
the industry and and just I mean fell in

714
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,538
love with it and the people and um kind

715
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,100
of decided more recently to go off do

716
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,140
some independent Consulting and kind of

717
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:18,058
build my own businesses

718
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,278
um which kind of brings me into I guess

719
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:21,720
uh you know what does 420 mean for me

720
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,119
personally

721
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,960
um it is my dog's birthday Mason for

722
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,599
real

723
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,538
birthday not like somebody filled it out

724
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:32,699
born on 420 so fittings

725
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:34,319
um but uh it's a day going back to the

726
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,120
mental thing and I know Corey mentioned

727
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,879
that I believe uh it's a day for me to

728
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:41,519
like relax slow down a bit and uh just

729
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,140
really appreciate what's around me

730
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,879
um it's a time to celebrate the plant

731
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,559
and kind of How Far We've came in the

732
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,340
industry and I can tell you from a

733
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,259
business Point uh it's fun because uh

734
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,819
we've been blessed and been able to get

735
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:55,740
three retail locations planted

736
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:58,019
provisioning in Michigan we have them in

737
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,759
Whitmore Lake flint and Bay City and uh

738
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:01,740
for me it's a time on that side of it to

739
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,058
kind of say thanks to our customers and

740
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,278
again Corey had mentioned this as well

741
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:06,778
but like bring people together have some

742
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,058
fun I mean we do like create we do

745
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,679
as well community and cannabis and

746
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,839
basically bringing them together so

747
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,220
awesome man and you and you rocked it

748
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,019
over a Precision extraction by the way

749
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,460
man it's sweet that you're still consult

750
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:25,259
for them but but obviously you killed it

751
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,640
over there so it's great to hear what

752
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:28,679
you're doing as far as your new Ventures

753
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,140
and opportunities thank you it's been a

754
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,019
wild ride yeah you're probably an

755
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,299
understatement right and Evan uh don't

756
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,440
know definitely last but not least but I

757
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:40,139
want to hear a little bit more from your

758
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,240
side as well uh we are now connected via

759
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,200
the documentary but I really love uh

760
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,960
some of the things they put in

761
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,659
perspective uh in this documentary about

762
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,100
the industry as a whole so same question

763
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,840
goes to you

764
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:54,418
I appreciate that

765
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,459
um yeah I guess my relationship with

766
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:58,340
cannabis has been a really interesting

767
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,919
one just growing up the East Coast

768
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:03,538
having the kind of use consumption

769
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,460
growth or anything always been

770
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:06,960
underground and something that you just

771
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,140
don't talk about that's a lot of things

772
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,700
that is a format of an East Coast

773
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,799
culture

774
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,798
um but I moved out to California about

775
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:19,558
12 years ago and prior to that I had an

776
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,740
experience with a friend of mine who

777
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:25,500
um would would kind of joke and poke but

778
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,900
one time he made this comment that I you

779
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,220
know I hadn't had my medicine and I

780
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,659
didn't really think about it it actually

781
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,940
kind of set me off a little bit more

782
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,220
until I moved to California and actually

783
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,900
understood what plant medicine really is

784
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,900
and what community really is all about

785
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,179
and and actually understood what he

786
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,980
meant as a joke was an actual real thing

787
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,538
and and going to some of the points that

788
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,000
were made

789
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:50,400
um you know I have a very active

790
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,519
um non-linear you know way of thinking

791
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,940
and so uh consuming has always helped me

792
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,339
to slow down my process slow down my

793
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,558
speaking understanding how to interact

794
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:03,899
better with people and and so that what

795
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:05,819
would happen as a very

796
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,900
um sort of friendly poke from uh I don't

797
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:08,759
know if it was friendly at the time but

798
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,019
a poke from a friend

799
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:12,240
um turned out to be something that

800
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:14,158
ultimately I learned very deeply about

801
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,519
over the course of time and my

802
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,778
connection to getting involved on the

803
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,940
business side was a little bit

804
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:23,819
fortuitous just as result of

805
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,278
relationships over time and working in

806
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:28,500
various Industries and entertainment

807
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:31,579
um media and with celebrities being some

808
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:34,500
of them and turned out got involved with

809
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:36,298
who some may call you know Beacon for

810
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,599
the industry in some ways in that Snoop

811
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:42,240
Dogg and from there and since about 2012

812
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,219
2013 have been involved in a lot of

813
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,519
different ways and ultimately for me it

814
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,140
comes down to really two aspects and

815
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,720
that's hospitality and ultimately

816
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,520
caregiving and to learn that very early

817
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,860
on in my life both my parents are

818
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,839
caregivers in different ways

819
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:00,119
um understood the value of what those

820
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,798
connections really mean and and getting

821
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:04,379
involved in

822
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:06,359
um the business side of it has somewhat

823
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,240
created a little bit of a challenge

824
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:12,240
because there is somewhat of a conflict

825
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,038
between what people see as an

826
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,919
opportunity to make a lot of money and

827
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:19,558
and all that might be true it's not the

828
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,980
intent that I've ever started out with

829
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:25,259
my intent has always been to provide

830
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:27,000
some value or some quality of care or

831
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:28,558
something that I can give to others and

832
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,099
ultimately the return of that if done

833
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:35,158
well is some potential return and that

834
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:37,500
could be Financial or otherwise so 420

835
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,778
to me has a little bit of a mixed bag if

836
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,058
you will on the one hand it does bring

837
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:44,220
Community together in a way that most

838
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:45,658
other holidays may not and and that's

839
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,819
really unique and interesting and

840
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,559
hearing some of the

841
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:52,379
um folks on the panel that do a lot of

842
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:54,720
giveaways and help people who may not

843
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,760
have the means to you know acquire plant

844
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,380
medicine on their own that's the

845
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,019
beautiful side of it on the other side

846
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,299
you know I see this tendency towards

847
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:05,099
trying to take as much from a consumer

848
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:08,339
as you can and and some of those

849
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:09,658
opportunities uh happen around 4 20.

850
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,480
some of them happen throughout the year

851
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,880
but but that holiday if you will some

852
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,519
people seem to point to as a way to

853
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,159
extract Extra Value from consumers

854
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,259
knowingly or unknowingly and um

855
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,539
it creates a little bit of a challenge

856
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:26,339
for me to to feel very free and

857
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:28,700
comfortable celebrating

858
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:30,839
um that day and more so the plant

859
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,340
interestingly enough for for me in the

860
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:34,379
business that we're in it's not just

861
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:35,699
cannabis it's really around all plant

862
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,620
medicine and

863
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,778
you know having Bicycle Day the day

864
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,058
before and then obviously 4 20 on on the

865
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:43,200
day after I think it's just an

866
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:46,619
interesting

867
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,419
um point to recognize how important

868
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:51,058
um plant medicine community and

869
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,820
caregiving really is uh psychedelics

870
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:55,259
will be able to play a much more

871
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:56,819
significant role in our lives as we

872
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:59,700
start to see

873
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:01,500
um those plans those substances being

874
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,778
more widely accepted as well and there's

875
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,339
a nice parallel between what happened

876
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:06,898
with cannabis and what's happening now

877
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:09,538
in the Psychedelic movement and

878
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:11,519
community and and um you know to me it

879
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:14,099
always comes back down to you know

880
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,058
developing at least this point in my

881
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,398
career

882
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,500
developing brands that can be the

883
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,178
carrier for that purpose and ultimately

884
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,980
that is to

885
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,559
um you know connect people more have

886
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,419
people feel more

887
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:29,700
deeply to heal in whatever way that

888
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:31,380
means and ultimately to thrive and you

889
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,140
know cannabis and plant medicine is a

890
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,120
way for me uh to be able to do that and

891
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,220
and um you know for me to to Really

892
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,558
share that with others so I appreciate

893
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,140
you having me on this on this uh

894
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,240
documentary and also on this webinar

895
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,399
yeah a great Avenue and you make some

896
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,778
excellent points that's you remind me of

897
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,759
saying I always say that you know well

898
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:53,099
alcohol I've always felt the alcohol

899
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:54,419
helps you lose yourself cannabis helps

900
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:56,459
you find yourself but I think to your

901
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,899
point psychedelics fall into that same

902
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,240
linear with these neural paths that

903
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:02,099
otherwise aren't aren't being used so

904
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,000
and you make an excellent point too for

905
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:05,519
people that come out to California

906
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,398
because we forget you know even before

907
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,679
the legalization via prop 215 in 1996 we

908
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,898
had prop P back in 1990 which was only

909
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:14,700
uh in this the city and county that is

910
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:16,979
San Francisco but that's back of the

911
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,298
brownie Marion the Dennis Peru but you

912
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,798
make a very valid point because Dennis

913
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:21,658
was always an advocate for medicinal

914
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,519
never for adult use of recreational he

915
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,080
always he always LED with medicinal at

916
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,179
all ages all levels because of that

917
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:29,519
potential but he really he really held

918
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:31,559
the line he was always 215 over six over

919
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,419
prop 64.

920
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:35,099
um so very interesting point you make

921
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,000
about how you know the people are most

922
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:37,558
passionate have made the biggest

923
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,940
movement it's always been for those

924
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,379
right reasons like you said for the

925
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,298
community and for the healing first not

926
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,519
for the profit and and for the

927
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:45,538
capitalism which um in my opinion I'm

928
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,778
with you should always come second

929
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:50,579
secondary so it's awesome strands I

930
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:52,500
didn't forget about you you know but I I

931
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:54,418
did want to ask you because of being an

932
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,460
individual that just in in recent years

933
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:58,500
I mean well I know personally you've

934
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,240
known of the plant but you've done

935
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,819
several documentaries prior to this one

936
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,140
you've done uh I believe Hydroponics you

937
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:05,819
actually covered aquaponics which is

938
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,720
awesome this is this country's not very

939
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:12,418
apt to aquaponics but you've covered it

940
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,398
both from urban grow commercial grow

941
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:16,618
um and then now kind of covering it kind

942
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,059
of holistically and across the board on

943
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,399
all aspects

944
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:22,500
um how has it been as you kind of segued

945
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,358
more into the space in general so so

946
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,300
maybe not so much just on 420 but as

947
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:29,699
you've covered it from behind the lens

948
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,679
uh from a very objective perspective how

949
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:34,559
has your kind of mindset towards this

950
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,679
space changed over the years

951
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,079
so I grew up on a farm in Iowa so

952
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,300
agriculture has always been kind of in

953
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,059
my in my mind and my background my last

954
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,220
name is Dutch and it means of the plow

955
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:49,699
so it's like literally in My DNA like

956
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:52,618
farming is just part of me

957
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:54,898
but you know I grew up really really

958
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:56,220
conservative it was always the joke oh

959
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:57,960
you're so straight edge

960
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,598
um so it wasn't even until film school

961
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,220
and college here in Arizona which is not

962
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,480
you know a place that's at the Forefront

963
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:04,559
of any of these movements you know

964
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,179
really pushing things forward but it's

965
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,799
not also you know too far behind we're

966
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:10,440
always kind of playing catch up in

967
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,599
Arizona and it was around that time that

968
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,400
you know there was shows like weeds uh

969
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,260
coming out or there were some

970
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,639
documentaries that were really like uh

971
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,800
kind of prominent at that time and it

972
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:22,019
was this awareness around this plant

973
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,820
that for my whole life had been you know

974
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:26,099
pretty misunderstood and it was through

975
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,039
content and media that I started

976
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:31,019
exploring that just how can a plant be

977
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,338
this bad this dangerous from like what I

978
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:34,619
grew up with what everyone's kind of

979
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,179
told the common knowledge right and it

980
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,260
was content that changed that shaped

981
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:38,759
that for me

982
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,380
and then over the years it's something

983
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,599
that I've always just been fascinated

984
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,700
with like watching things grow whether

985
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,220
it's a tree in my backyard or growing

986
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:49,379
tomatoes or vegetables or cannabis it's

987
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:51,000
just another plant to me and I found

988
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,519
that through all the documentaries we've

989
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,440
done all the people that we've talked to

990
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:58,800
It's oddly a part of almost everybody's

991
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,119
life whether they admit it or not a lot

992
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,099
of people are still have that you know

993
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,300
that shame that stigma of why I don't

994
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:05,160
really want to show this I don't want to

995
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,780
talk about this uh it is a part of me

996
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:08,699
and so I think there's just this still

997
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,519
this level of misunderstanding around

998
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:13,858
the plant and being able to tell some of

999
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,259
those stories on the cultivation side so

1000
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:18,598
that was the the first cannabis

1001
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,660
documentary we did it was on a home grow

1002
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,059
for a caregiver operation just from a

1003
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:27,118
house residential house and we premiered

1004
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:29,400
that on 420 a couple years ago and so

1005
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,079
growing growing up and in college at 420

1006
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,880
was always just like a joke

1007
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,000
um you know I was like oh it's 4 20. um

1008
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,619
but now you know more recently learning

1009
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,760
kind of the history of it I'm just just

1010
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,559
always

1011
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't know appreciative of like the

1012
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,639
fact that it's such a humble beginning

1013
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,260
and I think that is what resonates the

1014
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,900
most with me that it's now this kind of

1015
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,099
you know

1016
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,200
worldwide phenomenon

1017
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,780
from something just so simple as just

1018
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,279
you know the the humble roots of it so I

1019
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,099
think I always like to use the analogy

1020
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,480
of planting seeds uh in in any part of

1021
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,619
life you plant seeds and some of them

1022
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,760
will grow and some of them won't you

1023
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,619
never really know what you're going to

1024
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,119
get at the end of it but if you do your

1025
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:07,680
best and you take care of it and you

1026
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,820
tend to your garden you tend to your

1027
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,319
farm

1028
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,660
um you'll have this amazing Harvest at

1029
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,420
the end of it and I think that's true

1030
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:16,679
and what I want to do with content

1031
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,180
planting seeds because you don't know

1032
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:20,098
you don't know the person the one person

1033
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:21,480
might watch it and that person could the

1034
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,760
Ripple effects right the butterfly

1035
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,039
effect it's just uh you can't even

1036
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,680
capture you don't even know right but

1037
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:31,019
you just put out their good content good

1038
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:33,059
work good energy if you put good into

1039
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:34,920
the world I think it kind of perpetuates

1040
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:36,900
more good and I think that's kind of

1041
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,159
what it's it's all kind of shaped up uh

1042
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,599
to me and that's why I like to make

1043
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,159
these documentaries on the business of

1044
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,079
cannabis the cultivation of cannabis but

1045
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,940
also just other stuff about making

1046
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,039
sourdough bread or growing Gourmet

1047
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,838
mushrooms it's all part of this world

1048
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,239
where we're making things we're doing

1049
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,099
good try to make the world a better

1050
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:55,078
place for us locally and then I think

1051
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,200
that ends up spreading far beyond what

1052
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,300
we even are able to uh consider and know

1053
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,559
thank you you mentioned sourdough but

1054
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,119
that's one we've talked about on more

1055
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:05,880
than one occasion how much successive

1056
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,619
has come from that documentary now

1057
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,240
timing might have been a factor I mean

1058
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,099
I've always been a

1059
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:12,479
one in the kitchen to cook and I do love

1060
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:14,820
doing anything in my hand so gardening

1061
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,740
cooking fixing hot rods but man the

1062
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,079
sourdough Trend really took off during

1063
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:20,699
the pandemic and talk about timing and

1064
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,960
now that that company is thriving but

1065
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,159
for the right reasons to your point I

1066
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,539
think we discussed that you know it was

1067
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:28,920
100 organic uh figuratively and so you

1068
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,300
know for them to just have that

1069
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,800
documentary come out the right time and

1070
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,500
now to hear the people from around the

1071
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,820
world come and visit this Bakery in

1072
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,699
Arizona that happened to be in this

1073
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,900
documentary that you created but this is

1074
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:42,299
a different category right I think you

1075
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,380
touched on you know we I'm not going to

1076
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,940
speak for everyone but it looks like

1077
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,160
most of us are gen xers right around

1078
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,480
that range I'm on the younger end

1079
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,920
um but you know we grew up with the

1080
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,800
stigma associated with the Dare program

1081
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,960
Nancy Reagan which you know Darren uh

1082
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,980
they started Daryl I think it's Daryl

1083
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,240
walk start out here in Southern

1084
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,159
California but anyway the Dare program

1085
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:01,139
but even to your point like the Boomers

1086
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:03,179
and the whole Nixon era in 71 because

1087
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:05,219
you brought up a good point

1088
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,419
um Evan in that you know psychedelics

1089
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,279
and cannabis they they were being

1090
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,320
studied by the US government until Nixon

1091
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,119
started his one on drugs in 71. you know

1092
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,920
there's actual studies on the books from

1093
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,320
the government study and these these

1094
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,059
different uh substances and and before

1095
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,680
they obviously weaponize them but there

1096
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:21,719
is still that stigma right and you see

1097
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,118
that so much more prevalent here I still

1098
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:25,618
am surprised by going to a trade show in

1099
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,300
the Czech Republic and I remember

1100
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,220
walking into the facility and there was

1101
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,140
a pop-up daycare and I was like Wow

1102
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:32,759
Child Protective Services would be all

1103
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:34,799
over this if this was back in the States

1104
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,180
here they're being grown-ups about it

1105
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,820
they're being professional and taking

1106
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:40,799
this serious and they're like hey we we

1107
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,359
have a career this is our business this

1108
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,760
is what we do you and we have children

1109
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:46,559
that need to be tended to you know it's

1110
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,260
really interesting how that stigma like

1111
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,179
you said as much as we feel it's being

1112
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,640
better suppressed than before it still

1113
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:55,379
exists you know so thanks for being able

1114
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:56,759
to tell the story and again I I feel

1115
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,619
like you really tell from an objective

1116
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,300
perspective which which is I think that

1117
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:03,119
much more valued and appreciated by the

1118
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:06,599
audience so we've talked enough about it

1119
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,980
I know of Adam if you possibly have uh I

1120
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,140
guess it'd be a trailer if you would

1121
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,119
queued up but let's let's show this

1122
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,838
really quick I'm I'm super stoked about

1123
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,838
this game live

1124
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,140
cannabis has been around for thousands

1125
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:21,239
of years the stoner stereotype still

1126
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:23,159
persists to this day just because we're

1127
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,500
cannabis operators we're not criminals

1128
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:26,940
and we never have been

1129
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,619
about three quarters of the population

1130
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,720
of this country feel that it should be

1131
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:33,420
legal at some level in some states it's

1132
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,399
the number one cash crop businesses

1133
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,079
coming out of thin air to service the

1134
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,000
Cannabis space our goal is to

1135
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:40,440
sophisticate the Cannabis industry we

1136
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,599
are currently building that technology

1137
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,980
that doesn't exist a lot of people don't

1138
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,780
realize that this is a challenging

1139
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,579
industry it's akin to dancing and kite

1140
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,300
in a hurricane

1141
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:51,299
[Music]

1142
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:54,739
thank you

1143
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:59,639
shocks people how sophisticated these

1144
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:02,099
companies are I just love the challenge

1145
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:03,799
of really helping to change people's

1146
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:06,720
minds around this plant

1148
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,239
Ed dancing with a hurricane I love that

1149
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,578
quote Jack because that's one thing we

1150
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,319
all talk about just on on the phone with

1151
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:17,880
uh individuals she's been in the

1152
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,460
industry for several years been a part

1153
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,619
of the community and is not as much in

1154
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,838
touch with it as she has been over the

1155
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,820
last decade and she said yeah a lot of

1156
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:29,338
crazy stuff is going on and it's true I

1157
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,380
mean it's it's tough times for for many

1158
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:33,259
aspects of the the community

1159
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,220
domestically here in the States but

1160
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,420
specifically for our industry it's a

1161
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:38,399
little bit of a reset that we're going

1162
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,440
through again but I think you made a

1163
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,740
pretty interesting uh metaphor there

1164
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,780
Jack in reference to where things are so

1165
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:47,399
just to kind of talk about a few of the

1166
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,800
touch points that you all spoke on

1167
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,838
starting off with that one Jack is it

1168
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,640
where do you feel like things are as far

1169
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,559
as current state I mean it feels like

1170
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:56,759
it's tougher forever for us but things

1171
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,400
are still moving in the right direction

1172
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,839
as far as cannabis goes correct in the

1173
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,260
United States there's some encouraging

1174
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:06,599
signs that we'll have a uh you know nice

1175
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,180
you know nice little rebound we're

1176
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,079
covering stabilization this summer

1177
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:12,179
obviously things have been extremely

1178
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,339
challenging uh particularly California

1179
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,858
Nevada and Michigan Massachusetts you

1180
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:18,239
know Oklahoma the the program got you

1181
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:19,980
know so messy there that they actually

1182
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,500
voted against recreational marijuana

1183
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,179
which I think was a big shock and a

1184
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,920
moment for a lot of us to stop and take

1185
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:27,779
positive market and where the markets

1186
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,460
developed on the other hand I mean the

1187
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,859
international Market's booming you know

1188
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,720
there's um

1189
00:42:30,858 --> 00:42:35,880
the same proportion of the U.S

1190
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:37,500
population uh that has access to

1191
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,320
cannabis that's the same portion of the

1192
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,000
gold population soon and I'm very

1193
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,359
excited about what's happening in South

1194
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Africa and Thailand and in Colombia

1195
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,739
um Australia really especially in Europe

1196
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,420
all over the world you know in terms of

1197
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:54,179
Germany announcing that they're going

1198
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,320
towards more of a homegrown method

1199
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:56,699
um you know it'll be interesting to see

1200
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,440
how that plays out but that that's

1201
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:01,500
excites me that's empowering the

1202
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,700
patients and trying to empower

1203
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,300
um

1204
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:08,338
uh the local uh the the local cannabis

1205
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,318
economy and the local Canada's ecosystem

1206
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:12,358
and culture within there so I think

1207
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,679
we're really uh at the NASA stage of the

1208
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:15,299
gold market but that being said you know

1209
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,699
I say we're dancing kit in a hurricane

1210
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,800
because we have rapidly changing you

1211
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:21,659
know commoditized pricing coming coming

1212
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,980
into play of the market and a lot of

1213
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:24,838
people have been arguing for years you

1214
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,159
know what kind of industry is this what

1215
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:28,259
are we doing are we farming are we this

1216
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,578
or that and you know I've said for a

1217
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:33,420
couple years I'll tell you what kind of

1218
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:36,480
industry are we are 95 97 of this is is

1219
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,338
uh Agri commoditized agribusiness and

1220
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,260
cpg

1221
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:41,759
um and it's really a fight to get out of

1222
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,280
that and stay out of that and I still

1223
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,420
believe you know walking around

1224
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,099
benzinga last week I think you know

1225
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,139
two-thirds of the companies I saw at

1226
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:52,140
least won't be around in in three or

1227
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:53,699
five years and then I say I have some

1228
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:55,139
pretty big ones that are notorious and

1229
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:57,480
I've raised a lot of money and that's

1230
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:58,799
because the situation is still so fluid

1231
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,139
in the industry's so fluid and there's

1232
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,180
so many regulations like Banking and

1233
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:05,039
everything out that are are so moving

1234
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:06,960
under our feet I think you know we're in

1235
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,579
a flu business in a rapidly growing

1236
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,500
rapidly changing rapidly rapidly

1237
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,960
maturing industry in a very over

1238
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,000
regulated market

1239
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,440
um and it's it's an interesting time but

1240
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,119
you know they're in there are things to

1241
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,858
consider like I don't I don't I question

1242
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:21,720
how many California Brands would be

1243
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:23,400
surviving right now for products we're

1244
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:25,980
moving through the back door and it's

1245
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,338
coming back from the business

1246
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,420
you make a very valid point because

1247
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:32,880
how long are we as an instrument gonna

1248
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,318
talk about brand Equity yeah you know

1249
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,599
does does anybody actually give that

1250
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,199
much of a of a [ __ ] about a brand or do

1251
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,460
they just want a great experience

1252
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,500
and and that's like you said some of

1253
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,480
those Ransom backdoor deals I surprised

1254
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,039
to see what I thought was was knockoffs

1255
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,019
of California brands on the other side

1256
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:52,079
of the world in Thailand only to find

1257
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:54,119
out those really were the the brands and

1258
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,200
the product coming from California so to

1259
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,338
your point it's this whole Global

1260
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,439
movement and I agree kind of like

1261
00:44:56,338 --> 00:45:01,799
education in this country we're behind

1262
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,139
that that International stage I mean

1263
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,940
I've seen more cannabis than most people

1264
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:09,539
if it's a if it's a true world-class

1265
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,400
exotic you know and I I've recognized

1266
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:13,199
product from certain rooms in other

1267
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,700
parts of the world that's not to say

1268
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,078
that I haven't been in Thailand and it

1269
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:18,059
seems from the best rooms I've seen in

1270
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,740
the world there or you know a lot of

1271
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:21,059
these other markets I don't think you

1272
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:22,739
know it's true anymore of that if it's

1273
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:25,559
not growing in Northern California it's

1274
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:28,259
you know it's at the very best uh uh

1275
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:29,940
step below step below that

1276
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,400
um I don't think that's true anymore but

1277
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,019
yeah I mean we're in an intense Global

1278
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,579
Market where you know people are

1279
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:37,318
fighting those stylish Brands and

1280
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:39,960
flowers moving all over the world

1281
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,818
whether it be Barcelona or Thailand or

1282
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,780
cannabis clubs and you know on the

1283
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:47,699
Canary Islands of which there are 700

1284
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,780
yeah there's a lot there's a lot going

1285
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:50,219
on the international State and you

1286
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,200
mentioned Germany which Germany has been

1287
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:54,358
leading but we know also obviously uh

1288
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:56,279
the Czech Republic Czech is moving

1289
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:58,380
pretty rapidly as is Switzerland and and

1290
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,880
so like you said you know Europe with

1291
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,099
gosh double the populace of North

1292
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,318
America right 734 million plus people in

1293
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,180
the EU alone that that's a big audience

1294
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:07,800
that's a big consumer base it already is

1295
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:08,940
consuming today and I think that's one

1296
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,740
thing that's covered in the documentary

1297
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,599
like there's already the consumers

1298
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:15,118
there's already the demand it's just

1299
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,920
creating that infrastructure right so it

1300
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,559
definitely shifted quite a bit I think

1301
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,358
kind of tied into that too you know Evan

1302
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,279
um you know one of the the quotes that

1303
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,659
actually was in the the quick trailer

1304
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,700
was

1305
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:28,338
um touching on the stigma so how much do

1306
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:31,559
you think the stigma has played into

1307
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:32,759
where the U.S stands versus some of

1308
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:34,380
these other countries that have made a

1309
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,960
total 180 right I mean from capital

1310
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,338
punishment to completely legal in a

1311
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,858
country like Thailand which we would

1312
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:43,199
have never fathomed five ten years ago

1313
00:46:40,858 --> 00:46:46,139
how much is that playing a role in where

1314
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,118
we are positioned as a global leader or

1315
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:49,679
maybe not when it comes to cannabis in

1316
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:53,519
the legal state

1317
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:54,960
dominant Market dominant IP uh dominant

1318
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,800
techniques

1319
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,960
um

1320
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,680
plot leadership I would still say is

1321
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,659
very heavily the U.S uh but it's it's uh

1322
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,719
it continues to become a global and

1323
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:09,239
international movement I think um you

1324
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,879
know Canada certainly fall through a

1325
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:14,279
substantial you know and what seemed on

1326
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,420
some animal had to start but

1327
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,859
um I think many of the world's great

1328
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,318
cannabis companies probably have not

1329
00:47:16,858 --> 00:47:22,259
been started yet

1330
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:24,900
I would say The Stereotype has been

1331
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,700
somewhat broken down but still not fully

1332
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,039
yet you know you have a lot of people

1333
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,899
who have been able to share their

1334
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,759
stories more freely in the last 10 years

1335
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,380
at least in the US not not speaking

1336
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,859
internationally and that's made it

1337
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,300
easier for more

1338
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:41,880
NASA scientists into this space and

1339
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,560
others who who might feel a perceived

1340
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,119
risk if they come out I mean I I

1341
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,699
experienced that myself in the early

1342
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,740
days where you know I had challenges

1343
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:51,679
because I was actively involved and very

1344
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:54,598
vocally involved in the Cannabis

1345
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:57,299
industry and it's unfortunate but it is

1346
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,700
where we are and I don't know if that

1347
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,500
stigma is what's holding us back as much

1348
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:02,279
as

1349
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,639
um

1350
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,440
hour and grain stubbornness as a society

1351
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:09,239
in the U.S to think that we're right

1352
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,539
about everything in fact when we're

1353
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:15,059
generally not I mean the whole War on

1354
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:16,440
Drugs came from us and sort of reverting

1355
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:18,179
back from that is going to be really

1356
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,440
difficult in many ways at least if we're

1357
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:22,078
thinking about a

1358
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,818
functional Democratic Society you know

1359
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,680
sometimes we can question whether we are

1360
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:28,920
that or not

1361
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:31,440
um it's definitely created some barriers

1362
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,240
but I don't think that's ultimately the

1363
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,679
reason why we still have those issues

1364
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:35,459
today

1365
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:37,858
um

1366
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,179
I'm not a politician I don't ever want

1367
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:41,400
to be a politician but yet I know

1368
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:42,838
everything is political

1369
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,700
um which means that everything is is

1370
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:46,619
sort of driven by a profit motive

1371
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:49,559
especially in this country and that's

1372
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:52,800
really where I think a lot of the

1373
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,900
um you know the the headwinds are still

1374
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,720
um you know we can talk about religion

1375
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:01,619
and other issues and those two have

1376
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,719
various aspects of of a headwind for the

1377
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:04,980
the community and and the plant itself

1378
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:07,078
but

1379
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,619
I think it's more of a profit motivation

1380
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:12,300
or lack thereof to actually solve

1381
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:16,019
societal issues using plant medicine and

1382
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,460
using our ability to heal one another

1383
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:19,980
um is is why we're still in the position

1384
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:23,699
we are domestically internationally

1385
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,858
I'm not as familiar with how other

1386
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:27,419
countries are are fully embracing the

1387
00:49:25,858 --> 00:49:29,578
plant but certainly it's at a federal

1388
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,619
level which makes a lot easier to move a

1389
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:33,480
lot quicker and those political

1390
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:35,700
processes are far different than what

1391
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,619
we've been experiencing in the U.S

1392
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:39,118
good point and you're right and some

1393
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:40,318
especially at commonwealth countries I

1394
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,880
find you know because take like

1395
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:43,858
Australia for example which is

1396
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,260
essentially if England and the U.S had a

1397
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:47,578
had a child that's why that's how I kind

1398
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,079
of see the way that they function right

1399
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:51,660
because they they love barbecues and big

1400
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:54,180
V8 engines but they also do still have

1401
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,098
their tea at two so but I see them very

1402
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:57,539
much to your point they fully embraced

1403
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,519
our War on Drugs to the point of where

1404
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:01,559
they're doing swab testing on road sites

1405
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,539
after events out there which I've been a

1406
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:05,338
part of and it's crazy to think that

1407
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:07,500
they still have that mentality of this

1408
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:09,239
being that schedule one because myself

1409
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,639
being of all things the criminal justice

1410
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:13,919
major in college I'm kind of like you

1411
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:16,379
know how natal was like something was

1412
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,539
amiss I never saw why cannabis fit in

1413
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,280
schedule one along with cocaine and

1414
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:21,960
other substances it just never actually

1415
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,519
gosh cookings too

1416
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,559
um a PCP of methamphetamines you know

1417
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,480
never quite made sense to me on how it

1418
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:28,739
was classified but well being a brand

1419
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,838
holder well I know we're kind of a

1420
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:32,578
little over but Katie how does you know

1421
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:34,440
as far as where you are and what you're

1422
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:36,000
doing what you're offering what is the

1423
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,500
one thing that you continue to lead with

1424
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,420
in order to move forward in the current

1425
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,460
state of cannabis you know is it

1426
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:45,659
conversation is it

1427
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:47,940
yeah so we we decided to to take to

1428
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:50,818
really taboo Industries and combine them

1429
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:52,679
into one so we have not only uh Sexual

1430
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:55,739
Health and Wellness but then cannabis as

1431
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:58,318
well so for us it's been uh there's just

1432
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:59,939
so many hurdles to jump through

1433
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:01,380
um just in terms of you know in the

1434
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,179
documentary it says like just simple

1435
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:06,599
advertising like we can't do Instagram

1436
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:09,000
we can't do uh Google ads we can't you

1437
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:11,640
know it's it's really very very

1438
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,260
challenging and so I think building a

1439
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:15,598
community is kind of the key and that's

1440
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:18,720
something that we're actively

1441
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,880
um building is a is a is a positive

1442
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,699
Sexual hellness Health and Wellness

1443
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,559
Community but it's hard it's really hard

1444
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:27,179
in terms of even just the the

1445
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,700
regulations you know we ordered

1446
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:32,519
packaging and by the time we ordered

1447
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:34,019
packaging they had changed a lot and the

1448
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:35,400
packaging that we ordered we could no

1449
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:36,960
longer use and had to order new

1450
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,338
packaging

1451
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,900
um which is

1452
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:41,818
which is kind of all part of the

1453
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,099
industry I think all of us have had

1454
00:51:41,818 --> 00:51:46,800
something like that happen yeah the

1455
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:48,059
moving Target for sure definitely well I

1456
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,700
know we're getting close on time but

1457
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:52,920
want to Circle back to Easter on so you

1458
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:54,779
know this has been again it was a really

1459
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,460
different angle that was taken with this

1460
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,200
documentary is a little bit more of the

1461
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,338
reality right the real side of things

1462
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,719
like you said you cover different

1463
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:02,940
aspects

1464
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:03,959
um but as opposed to uh you know and I

1465
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,338
think it was mentioned some of the early

1466
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,619
documents one of the first documentaries

1467
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:09,779
I was tied to in the industry was uh it

1468
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:10,980
was rolling papers which was one that we

1469
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,559
did with the Cannabis out in Colorado

1470
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,179
this is back in 2014.

1471
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:16,920
um that was more about the buzz and the

1472
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:18,719
energy and the hoopla and all the money

1473
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,940
and everything this one took a little

1474
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,379
bit more of a surreal look at it

1475
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,119
um what do you think the follow-up is

1476
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,460
you know if there was to be another one

1477
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,440
in a year what would that look like do

1478
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,659
you think compared to to what we covered

1479
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,920
here

1480
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:34,379
certainly to talk more about the

1481
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,579
international and Global stage as it

1482
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,318
relates to how everything's becoming

1483
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:38,760
connected now I mean I intentionally

1484
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:42,058
wanted to focus on

1485
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,160
the US for this one but I think there's

1486
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,780
more stories to be told there as well as

1487
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,279
just some of the interesting stories of

1488
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,380
the people who were

1489
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,559
kind of risking it all doing things when

1490
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:55,200
it was uh much more highly punished than

1491
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,579
it is now I think is another area that's

1492
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:57,719
you know you can never tell enough of

1493
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:59,640
those stories I think because those are

1494
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:01,259
the people who you know deserve a lot of

1495
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:03,960
credit for what they did the risk they

1496
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,400
took and the sacrifices they made so I

1497
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,159
think there's always more stories to

1498
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,599
tell because it occurred to me as Evan

1499
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,759
was talking

1500
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,300
you know the War on Drugs is often

1501
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,940
framed as a failure and we've failed

1502
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:20,099
with the War on Drugs but it's very rare

1503
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,960
if if not ever that I've heard it framed

1504
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,460
as it was wrong

1505
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,900
um almost as if it would have like oh

1506
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,858
well if it had been a success it would

1507
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,559
have been you know it would have been

1508
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:30,779
worth it if we were able to achieve this

1509
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,240
win the war on drugs

1510
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,339
um but I think moving forward uh I think

1511
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:38,098
a lot of that the damage that has been

1512
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:40,739
done needs to be framed as like this was

1513
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:42,359
wrong it was like this was bad

1514
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:43,919
um and we need to kind of come to terms

1515
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:45,598
with that I think as a society and a

1516
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,760
culture for however many you know

1517
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,859
everyone who kind of bought into that

1518
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,780
belief that all all these people are are

1519
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:52,920
evil and criminals and we need to punish

1520
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,720
them

1521
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,800
um and kind of like make amends for all

1522
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:57,719
of that I think there's a lot more

1523
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,519
stories that could be told there

1524
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:00,899
yeah I mean I think it'd be a very valid

1525
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,338
point I didn't know until more recently

1526
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,079
I mean I I knew all the way back to the

1527
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:05,578
anslinger days but I didn't know it was

1528
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,980
Napoleon and it was the French that

1529
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:10,619
actually started the the true war on

1530
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,838
cannabis that blew my mind when I went

1531
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:13,980
that far back into the history books and

1532
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:15,838
learned about that's where it really

1533
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,059
started but to your point

1534
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:19,679
um I I hear it as well the failed War on

1535
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:21,300
Drugs versus the fact that the war on

1536
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:23,338
specifically this drug should have never

1537
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,260
happened because it was weaponized to

1538
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:27,539
Target minorities obviously during the

1539
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:29,460
inslinger era but also during the Nixon

1540
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:32,099
era into a certain extent I believe the

1541
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,539
Dare era as well with the modern day War

1542
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:35,640
on Drugs that we all grew up with but

1543
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:37,380
again really appreciate the storytelling

1544
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,420
I appreciate all of you for being a part

1545
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:42,000
of it again I think it was such a props

1546
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,220
to strongs for such a diverse group of

1547
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,139
individuals with with so many different

1548
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:48,539
backgrounds in so many different

1549
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:50,699
motivations that tie to what makes you

1550
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,619
passionate about what you do because

1551
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:54,118
that's one thing that again I really

1552
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:56,338
applaud an individual it's coming from

1553
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,079
the outside in and being able to top

1554
00:54:56,338 --> 00:55:01,500
people that put passion in Community

1555
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,539
First and an industry of profit second I

1556
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,519
think that's as much as we'd like to

1557
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:07,079
thank everyone in this community is Good

1558

Vibes we know there are players who are

1559
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:10,740
just out for that extreme capitalism

1560
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:12,659
