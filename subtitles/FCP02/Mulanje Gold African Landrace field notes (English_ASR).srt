1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
hey there it is October 30th so it's

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,179
Sunday we're almost done with October

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,638
and all of our African uh sativas are

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,219
going real strong so looking good so

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,378
this is another field notes uh this

6
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,059
particular plant right here we've

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,260
planted two of these but this is a

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:26,339
Malawi uh but specifically uh mulanier

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,320
and I looked it up it's Mulan Hape but I

10
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,539
guess you pronounce it actually Mulan

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,480
yay so trying to get all the

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,539
pronunciations correct uh so anyway this

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:42,179
is a beautiful beautiful gorgeous land

14
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:45,359
race from Malawi and uh yeah all I can

15
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,640
say is absolutely gorgeous

16
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,280
gonna take a sniff

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,780
and a close-up of that bud hopefully

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,120
it's going in focus

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,020
and as you can see it's got sort of that

20
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,599
traditional African spear shape uh I'm

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,280
guessing it's gonna be about two weeks

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,260
so mid-november will probably be

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,780
harvesting these maybe as far as into

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,618
Thanksgiving we'll see how quickly this

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,200
finishes up uh the top Cola I would say

26
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,840
is about 12 feet tall

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,400
uh and then

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,400
um oh and the smell

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,159
wow

30
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,539
very bizarre

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,159
almost uh caramel

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,159
caramel and fruit

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,799
yeah a week ago this was all rotten

34
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,419
fruit but now it's developing like a

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,820
creamy caramel

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,159
nose which is very bizarre let me smell

37
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:47,959
this one to make sure

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,960
now this one's a little more spicy

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,159
maybe each one's different

40
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,500
no this one's got the caramel again so

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,240
anyway definitely a caramel fruit thing

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,399
going on

43
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,618
uh which is really actually unique for

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,700
African sativa so anyway

45
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:07,618
totally loving this plant as well so and

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,500
again we just want to honor all these

47
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:15,060
plants so these came directly from

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,340
Malawi from uh mulanier area and so

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,319
whoever if anyone because of the

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,800
internet if anyone sees this video who's

51
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:25,378
