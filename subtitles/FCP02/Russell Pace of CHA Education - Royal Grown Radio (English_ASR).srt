00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:18,019
of dig into

33
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,579
a little bit of what got you to where

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,780
you are what inspired you to take the

35
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:29,759
path and yeah you know you know get to

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,799
where you are today so so how did you

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,280
end up in Humboldt first yeah

38
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,040
uh well funny story no I mean there's a

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,439
long backstory I suppose I you know

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,600
it you know in a bizarre way it kind of

41
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:46,679
started when I was 12 years old and I

42
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:49,739
went to Tibet when I was 12. and wow I

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,079
saw weed growing in the mountainous

44
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,359
Hills and even at monasteries high up in

45
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,798
the mountains and I kind of I don't know

46
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,840
it was just like this thing where I was

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,759
like that plant what is this plant like

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,520
you know and I didn't even know what it

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,859
was and my dad was like Wilson that's a

50
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,899
marijuana plant and I was like oh I like

51
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,580
it even more I don't know it's just this

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,199
weird Affinity you know I can't explain

53
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,819
it just like this like magnetic

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,000
attraction to this plant

55
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:17,939
and uh honestly at 12 years old you know

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,860
what weed is right yeah well I was

57
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,199
pretty sheltered and I mean I knew what

58
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,080
it was I had never I'd never smoked it

59
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,839
before but I was a little bit of a

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,120
you know I could see growing up in

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,700
Humboldt at 12 you smoked but growing up

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,560
where I did you know it was like not as

63
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,598
common you know dare you hear about it

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,520
but I went through the Dare program I

65
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,139
know yeah back in Michigan yeah it was

66
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,840
like a funny start because me and my

67
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,059
buddy Riley Berry I went with this kid

68
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,159
from La that I grew up with and his

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,860
grandmother his family actually was the

70
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,419
Barry family who um his great uncle

71
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,519
wrote Peter Pan

72
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,500
and so they were like you know loaded

73
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,300
and had money from the silk trade and

74
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,739
the Orient and stuff and so that's how

75
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,260
this whole trip kind of got set up it

76
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,819
was like this weird little thing with

77
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,318
them wanting to do this we were like

78
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,179
with a film crew they were making a

79
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,098
documentary about like the Warriors of

80
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,439
calm and these like high mountainous

81
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:14,098
planes in Tibet and we just like tagged

82
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,919
along in this like crazy Saga anyways

83
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:18,179
and but we were there and and so we were

84
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,979
I'd never forget we're outside this

85
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,780
Monastery high up in the hills and we're

86
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,939
like dude let's like steal some let's

87
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,459
try to smoke some weed and we didn't

88
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,979
know what we were doing and it was July

89
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,658
so the plants were just vegging so we

90
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,280
just like ripped off some fan leaves

91
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:34,199
when no one was looking we like took

92
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,759
them and this sweet old Chinese lady

93
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,318
named Bernice that we were with was

94
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,939
smoking cigarettes and we got her to

95
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,399
bomb us a cigarette we like emptied out

96
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,019
the tobacco dried out the leaves a few

97
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,200
days later and then like packed the leaf

98
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,780
in we're like smoking this fan Leaf out

99
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,639
of a cigarette and they were like would

100
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,019
you feel anything like no I don't feel

101
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,059
I'm like I don't think we're doing it

102
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,340
right something's not right you know so

103
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,439
but you know it's kind of a funny like

104
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,259
backstory yeah it's a good start first

105
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,000
time I smoked weed yeah

106
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:05,098
yeah into bed CBD and that was just

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,019
growing growing wild somewhere I was

108
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:09,119
just good yeah well that spot was

109
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,158
cultivated like it was that was the

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,780
first I think I have a photo of it I

111
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:13,620
have an old photo book of all these

112
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,479
photos

113
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,180
when you walk up to the monastery it was

114
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,159
like a you know six by six plot like it

115
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,319
was like a actual you could tell that

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,419
was a cultivation patch the other

117
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,779
patches growing out were just like fair

118
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,219
you know wild wild growing like it was

119
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,319
growing up and even now to the streets

120
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,419
some of the streets you know the cracks

121
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,159
like just wherever but

122
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:36,899
um yeah it was interesting that was like

123
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,080
that was off then that was it that was

124
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,719
off to Off to the Races and just like

125
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,758
kind of dabbled in weed and I bounced

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,680
around a lot I moved back and forth

127
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,900
between California and Virginia okay

128
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,579
quite a bit and so

129
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:53,219
you know like high school you try to

130
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:55,379
grow in the red Solo cups you know oh

131
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,440
yeah like you know that all that jazz

132
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,418
and you know in college was it was in

133
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,879
college back in Virginia and then just

134
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:04,439
um you know we grew out in the in out in

135
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,879
the hills of West Virginia up in the

136
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,639
mountain like trying to like find little

137
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,100
patches really it's very more dangerous

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,100
out on the East Coast with laws oh yeah

139
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,139
so we just try to be more careful

140
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,620
gorilla style yeah for sure

141
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,978
um and then so I'm kind of like

142
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,879
backstory okay re reorient here uh and

143
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:27,538
then

144
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,339
um I I got my degree in geology I had a

145
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:31,860
Bachelor of Science in geology and so I

146
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:35,399
was working down in Orange County uh

147
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,199
after after college and

148
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:40,739
it was just I was just getting burnt out

149
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,379
by the SoCal Vibes you know like all the

150
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,720
gas stations are leaking gasoline and I

151
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,279
was like remediating those and I was

152
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,860
just you know growing weed on the side

153
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,659
you know indoors a little bit

154
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,220
and just like tired of driving through

155
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,360
traffic and I was like I got I gotta get

156
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,680
out of here

157
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,240
and I was like and I was going through a

158
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,220
lot of existential healing you know I

159
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,160
had like bad allergies and you know

160
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,600
other immunological like imbalances and

161
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,419
I was like I I just wanted to get the

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,000
[ __ ] out of there I was pretty much done

163
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:11,099
with the LA Vibe you know grelly's great

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,899
and all but I just and and for some

165
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,360
reason it was just you know my mom she's

166
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,099
from Mount Shasta so I'm familiar with

167
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,300
Humboldt you know even though I'd never

168
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,780
really been it was sort of like this

169
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,379
magical mysterious like land

170
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:29,038
yeah of weed it and it is yeah it is it

171
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:31,079
totally is and I came up here in 2006 to

172
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,759
work on my master my excuse was I'm

173
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,959
gonna just go get my Master's Degree in

174
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,259
geology

175
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,359
and then I joke around I dropped that I

176
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,139
I never completed my masters and I just

177
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,000
got a masters in botany or whatever you

178
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,280
know

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,699
biology or you know plant chemistry or

180
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:53,099
yeah cultivation and yeah yeah all of

181
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:56,100
the above miners in maybe a minor in

182
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,259
mycology and entomology but you know

183
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,080
kind of like just studying just I spent

184
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:03,199
I just switched gears because geology is

185
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,599
cool but it doesn't really do much good

186
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,240
for you know solving immediate problems

187
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,560
I mean some of this stuff does like I

188
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,600
said he's a great role I studied

189
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,819
hydrogeology and geochemistry and some

190
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,879
soil science it has a great yeah com

191
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:20,639
side component like it it but you know

192
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,740
anyways so a lot of times yeah yeah tie

193
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,720
in it tied in it tied in nicely and then

194
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,939
yeah I just came up here and I was like

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,740
on this existential healing Quest I was

196
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,978
like I gotta I gotta repair whatever

197
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:35,340
this this illness is and I met this guy

198
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:39,538
in Arcata John yamas God bless that man

199
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:42,779
he was this crazy acupuncturist on top

200
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:44,219
of it G Street and he was like just do

201
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,659
this and this I'm like I don't know man

202
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,720
that sounds like kind of weird he's like

203
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,039
just do it and I switched my diet up and

204
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,020
then like over a course of a few years

205
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:55,259
like I had massive changes in health

206
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:57,180
which is Improvement you know so like

207
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,800
that's sort of what like home it was

208
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,560
just like you know thing with Humboldt

209
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,680
is weed and healing that's like what

210
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,939
drove me to go into Humboldt and I found

211
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,939
both of them

212
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:11,339

would buy buy stuff and then ask

226
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,819
questions but they were such a huge

227
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,920
Catalyst for so many people in the

228
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,540
Herbal Healing like cannabis brought a

229
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,579
ton of people here and I've seen it

230
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:52,799
we've all seen it

231
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,180
the healing medicine at cannabis brings

232
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,338
people here and then they're like wait

233
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,859
this plant heals what about other plants

234
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,720
what about tea what about diet like yeah

235
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,940
it's a catalyst for a greater

236
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,519
Consciousness and movement for health

237
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,560
and healing and I agree those women at

238
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,740
Humboldt herbals were certainly really

239
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,379
important in kind of sparking

240
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,240
the learning of a lot of people in our

241
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,919
Circle that's awesome I'm glad I you

242
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,080
know that's really cool I'm actually

243
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,240
super jazzed to hear that yeah yeah

244
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,800
because it's true it's like cannabis is

245
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,720
it's funny because people always talk

246
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,479
about cannabis is um

247
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,120
it it occupies so many roles with

248
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,399
increasing Consciousness so to speak you

249
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,220
know like some people would say it's it

250
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,659
helped the the regulations and and

251
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,879
testing on cannabis help people

252
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:41,639
understand how many pesticides were used

253
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,759
on food products it kind of increased

254
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,100
awareness in that field you know and

255
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,019
especially then with herb herbal

256
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,060
medicine you know it opens people's

257
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,940
doors so oh well if this is Herb that he

258
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:56,278
helps me what other herbs also help and

259
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,019
it's a huge thing yeah I I could go on

260
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,600
and on like this is like really gets me

261
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,959
Jazz it helps drive people into the let

262
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,720
your food beer medicine Consciousness as

263
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,159
well in a big way I feel like it

264
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,259
certainly did that for me I started

265
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,299
smoking weed and not long after started

266
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,240
choosing healthier foods and starting to

267
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:17,219
be like wow why is why do I feel this

268
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,339
way and cut Dairy out of my life and was

269
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,519
like I feel so much better and just it

270
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,279
it opens the doors to exploring health I

271
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,659
feel like yeah yeah it's it's pretty

272
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:33,480
magical I wish yeah I don't I mean yes

273
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,399
so amazing and the depth so

274
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,700
part of what I love about your content

275
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:42,200
is the focus on the details of

276
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:45,000
regenerative growing gardening

277
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,640
understanding what's happening

278
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,879
above and below the soil line and kind

279
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,500
of connecting the dots yeah and that's

280
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,419
something that's really intrigued me

281
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,879
about some of you know

282
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,799
you're on Farm experiences where you're

283
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,539
pulling back the tops of the soil and

284
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,639
you're showing your inoculation of

285
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,980
mushrooms and how it's you know a

286
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,439
symbiotic relationship in the soil and

287
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,778
sure tell us a little bit about how that

288
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,060
like Consciousness changed after you

289
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:14,220
moved here kind of tied into this yeah

290
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,919
yeah so that's another great tie-in too

291
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,680
because it's like I was like had you

292
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:22,559
know three quarters fully inserted in

293
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,479
the anthropogenic western world really

294
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,179
you know this like one quarter trying to

295
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,639
figure out what this other thing is

296
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:31,199
and and then coming and then as on this

297
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,439
quest of like you know learning about

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,540
herbal medicine and health realizing how

299
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,000
mushrooms were a big important part of

300
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,480
tying it in you know and it's like the

301
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,320
whole Synergy between you know taking

302
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,420
psilocybin and

303
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,860
expanding that level of Consciousness

304
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,559
and then understanding from a

305
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,139
mycological standpoint how adaptogenic

306
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:55,399
mushrooms are good for your body and

307
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:58,500
then how mushrooms also um you know

308
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,259
grow in the in the soil and have a

309
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,360
decomposition process and generate life

310
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,600
that way as well that the whole tie-in

311
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,480
really and humble to me is like the

312
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,920
mycological like it was like a giant

313
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,500
heightful Network every all these

314
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:14,759
mycologists are all like super hyped

315
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,799
they're all you know passing around

316
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,720
we're getting connected through South

317
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,399
sybin and then there's like the Redwoods

318
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,160
and there's these like typhy layers in

319
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,278
the forests everywhere everyone I know

320
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:28,679
hunts mushrooms almost like I'm still

321
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:32,100
the weak weak link I'm like take me out

322
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,259
and I've hunted oyster mushrooms and I

323
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,000
need to go out and do chanterelles and I

324
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,740
haven't done it much yet well this is a

325
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,778
perfect list you should come out with me

326
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,839
yeah I'm right on the in the coastal

327
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:44,458
Forest before the Redwoods yeah up north

328
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,600
of McKinleyville and it's really cool

329
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,578
because

330
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,759
this entire area the Redwoods everything

331
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:53,819
it's just like a giant mycelium slick

332
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,980
almost right but the coastal Forest the

333
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,260
spruce Hemlock

334
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,000
um Alder Willow forests of that like

335
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,879
kind of coastal Wetland produce

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,980
mushrooms way more than a lot of the

337
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,379
Redwood forests at least the Edibles So

338
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,000
Dope yeah I'm all about it sidebar let's

339
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:10,919
go yeah let's go hedgehogs and some

340
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,139
chanterelles yeah let's go because other

341
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:16,919
I've just been cultivating them in my

342
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:19,019
own you know getting my cilia flat mats

343
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:22,620
or flats you know from like Levon from

344
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:25,139
fungi Farm yeah levon's awesome and he

345
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,539
you know just cultivating kingstropharia

346
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,519
and some shiitake logs and that's been

347
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:30,958
really cool but yeah I definitely like

348
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,820
to get out in the woods but all right

349
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,939
we're kind of tangenting um we do that

350
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,100
here going yeah yeah it's awesome

351
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,120
the whole principle of humble represents

352
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,019
this like

353
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,000
interesting ecosystem where it is it's

354
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:47,278
it's sort of pristine I don't know it's

355
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,799
got this element of like

356
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,620
I don't know it's magical it's sort of

357
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,899
magical it's like it's disconnected from

358
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,539
the rest of the world in some degree and

359
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,100
in a way it is yeah the Redwood

360
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,838
curtain's real yeah the Redwood curtain

361
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,839
is a real thing and it's like kind of

362
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,720
this I'd often joke that a [ __ ] tree

363
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,519
is blocked capitalism from coming up

364
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,519
here and fully developing it like

365
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,560
literally 100 like a tree has stopped

366
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,620
that development and I don't know it's

367
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,419
kind of interesting to me just from a

368
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,578
metaphorical standpoint I guess it's

369
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,500
metaphorical but it's so real like the

370
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:24,479
Caltrans project to try and widen the

371
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,399
101 coming up here has been stopped by

372
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,320
the redwood trees for those of you at

373
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
home that don't know the kind of

374
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,760
background of that statement it's

375
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,399
actually true that the redwoods have

376
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,379
stopped the wholesale

377
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,419
you know you know capitalistic

378
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:41,578
development correct because this area

379
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:44,278
there's two trees to be specific I think

380
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,620
there's two they're like really the base

381
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,179
of the argument yeah right there two

382
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,179
trees are just stopping that from

383
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:53,278
happening it's amazing yeah so it's a I

384
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,859
don't know it's like Humboldt's really

385
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,419
special people don't realize out there

386
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,759
in the world you should come up and

387
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:02,219
visit Humboldt we have like an amazing

388
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,439
Redwood forest and a beautiful Pacific

389
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,320
Ocean and not far off for the Trinity

390
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,779
Alps and it's just a really unique

391
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,699
microsystem yeah like you know Patrick's

392
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,220
Point you know just so beautiful it's

393
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:16,799
incredible it's amazing it's really when

394
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,959
I got here almost 30 years ago there was

395
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,838
a feeling that hit me like a bag of

396
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,299
bricks of comfortability and a sense of

397
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,000
home like a you know like I'd been here

398
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,379
before and I and I knew that there was

399
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,078
no way I was going to be able to leave

400
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:34,019
ever and then I went to Ireland where

401
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:37,019
100 of my ancestors are from on the west

402
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:39,720
coast of Ireland and and it was just

403
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,399
mind-blowing how similar it was in the

404
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,800
west coast of Ireland and I was like

405
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,019
well [ __ ] no wonder why I [ __ ] love

406
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,359
Humboldt so much and I felt like I was

407
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,120
home right isn't that a funny thing yeah

408
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,278
that's such a funny thing like my mom's

409
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,078
family's from Italy Northern Italy and

410
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,759
then they migrated up to Mount Shasta

411
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:58,739
and then I'm like looking at photos from

412
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,958
where they're from in Northern Italy I'm

413
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,419
like holy [ __ ] this is like they just

414
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,518
like went like it's like a micro fractal

415
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,740
of where they were they just found it

416
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,720
somewhere else in the world it's kind of

417
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,120
it's cool it's really interesting and

418
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,699
where I came from in Michigan my family

419
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,820
is mostly from Germany going back and

420
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:20,458
it's a huge German Network and very

421
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,920
similar at least especially 100 plus

422
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:24,899
years ago very very similar to the black

423
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,879
forest in those original deciduous

424
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:30,120
forests in the northern part of Germany

425
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,539
laying on the similar latitude just like

426
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,980
a similar latitude to here

427
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:37,139
it's cool it's like really interesting

428
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,959
to me how that works like that

429
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:42,899
but so kind of tangenting back to the

430
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,578
topic yes you know the development of

431
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,639
like the regenerative agriculture

432
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:52,500
mindset was really stimulated by

433
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:55,139
mycology that was the root of it and you

434
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,159
know over the years you'd see all of

435
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,100
these

436
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:01,500
people performing these types of

437
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,240
um you know DIY projects

438
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,459
and you know I would try some and just

439
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,439
fail and they would like shank hard and

440
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,298
be like what how does this you know how

441
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,319
does this work or how does this and I

442
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,679
was always I don't know I was always

443
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,539
driven by wanting to try to

444
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,519
figure out the science of it you know

445
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,899
just how it works once the science is

446
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,480
figured out you don't need to think much

447
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,100
about it but once but the key is like

448
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,860
figuring out how the science works like

449
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:28,438
like dosage you know like I have a

450
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,779
willow bark tree well it's the bark is

451
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,840
salicylic acid how much bark do I need

452
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,759
to boil to get the right salads like I

453
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,199
don't know like I [ __ ] like I don't

454
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,660
know what there's no answer to that

455
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,080
there's this really is it how how that

456
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,298
works you'd I'd have to send a sample in

457
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,279
and like tat and run tests and that

458
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:49,980
costs money you know but I've always

459
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,500
been driven by that principle to figure

460
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,360
that out or like you know with that's

461
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,220
that's just the bark like then you go

462
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,439
with the willow shoots that are more for

463
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,538
the cloning solution you know it's like

464
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,000
what's what percentage of indo-butyric

465
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:05,038
acid is in the shoots like how do you

466
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,558
figure out how much you need to clone

467
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:10,379
you know to make like a cloning gel and

468
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:13,079
at what point in its life is it does it

469
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,000
possess the most aggressive quality in

470
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,678
the spring I know I know that's in the

471
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,660
spring spring months with the fresh

472
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,140
shoots right when we have the highest

473
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,779
yeah of the rooting hormone IBA yeah

474
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,460
okay but you know it's it's essentially

475
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,678
like I mean if you want to like drive

476
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,900
home an overarching principle like

477
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,600
the plant medicine healed me I'm

478
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,019
indebted to plant medicine and I want to

479
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,839
figure out how to

480
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:44,460
to to figure out I want to figure out

481
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:47,519
how to measure it at a like a level for

482
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,579
home Growers so everyone has like a base

483
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,980
sort of analysis of how that works you

484
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:54,720
know like with like con so you know

485
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,538
with the dynamic accumulators like

486
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,759
comfrey and yarrow and nettle and Mullen

487
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:02,339
whatever blah blah blah like that's

488
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,079
probably the first main research science

489
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:07,379
that I conducted where I was like well

490
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,240
let's figure out what nutrient values of

491
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,760
these are you know if you're going to

492
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,240
grow them and then add them to your

493
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,640
soil for fertilizer can you do that

494
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,038
successfully with knowing and so I

495
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,900
that's a it's a it's hard because some

496
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,819
of this is tricky the the tricky part is

497
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,280
that there's not it's all turkey it's

498
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:28,500
there's there's there's ranges of values

499
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,660
that's the tricky part well that's very

500
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,900
similar to cannabis like you can grow

501
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,360
the same cultivar region or region you

502
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,320
know from from one Valley to to the next

503
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,538
and you're going to see those

504
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,639
differences it's not gonna yeah be the

505
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,259
exact same yeah that works for all herbs

506
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,000
and that's kind of the Alchemy of the

507
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,220
process is that there's like the people

508
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,500
that do it are just like artists and

509
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,460
sort of Alchemists I feel like it makes

510
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:56,220
it difficult to put a full 100 stamp of

511
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,558
science on yeah plant medicine for that

512
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,480
reason yeah you know because there are

513
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,099
just variances yeah for sure it's like a

514
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,240
controllable I could tell you if you

515
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:08,579
want to have like time in your tea for

516
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,279
respiratory issues to use a tablespoon

517
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:12,720
of it but if you grow it in depleted

518
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,480
soil and it doesn't have the same

519
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,339
concentration of essential oils maybe

520
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,380
you need two tablespoons to get the

521
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:21,359
right dose you just that's like this

522
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,160
like unknown or the same with like the

523
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,319
dynamic the biggest pushback I've had

524
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,880
with the dynamic accumulators like well

525
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,159
you can't really use that as a value

526
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,840
because the soil they're going to

527
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,380
accumulate nutrients differently in

528
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:36,599
different soils truth and based on a lot

529
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,520
of factors what's in the soil yeah what

530
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,079
fungus is in the soil what's what

531
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,779
bacteria is in the soil what's

532
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,759
liberating those items and making them

533
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:48,480
plant available those interactions

534
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:52,440
between you know microorganisms

535
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,179
inert chemistry and the plant all make

536
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,100
such a difference yeah and that's what

537
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:58,140
it's really hard to drive home so I'm

538
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:01,019
trying at least with the dynamic

539
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:03,120
accumulators to provide I think I've

540
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,759
gotten to a decent framework of

541
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,279
understanding so I have this I use Sam

542
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,339
at soilscape and I did some tests a

543
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:14,099
number of years ago I have these mpk

544
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:17,099
values and I have like the main values

545
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:19,859
of their spikes of you know it's like

546
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:23,699
calcium magnesium

547
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:27,058
um there's even silica potassium

548
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,960
and uh and and then what I did was is

549
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:31,200
that

550
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,298
um Dr Duke has this this guy Dr Duke's

551
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,000
created an ethnobotanical database have

552
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:37,558
you guys ever heard of this

553
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,380
it's a U.S department of agricultural

554
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:44,158
website this guy Dr Duke did a long time

555
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:46,260
ago and it's a huge giant database of

556
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,900
phytochemistry of like plant chemicals

557
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,879
he created this like huge database of

558
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,000
like I don't even know how many hundreds

559
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,679
or thousands of different plant species

560
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,659
and it has a lot of the different

561
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,059
chemicals like the terpenes or the

562
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,760
Esters or whatever other plant compounds

563
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:05,220
there are yes and then it also has

564
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,319
nutrient values to the best of his

565
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,298
ability it doesn't have them all there's

566
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,879
missing gaps but there's quite a bit of

567
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:14,579
data that he's collected so I've been

568
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,980
taking the data that I've aggregated and

569
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,658
comparing them with his data so like

570
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,940
I'll look on the web on his on the

571
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:23,760
website and see like okay his comfrey

572
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,340
says yada yada and then I'll be like my

573
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,500
Humphrey says this this this

574
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:30,119
and what's like sort of the correlation

575
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,759
what's this you know statistical

576
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,019
correlation and there I can post it I

577
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,980
can show you guys like it's actually

578
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:40,918
pretty good like I'm actually impressed

579
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:44,220
how much overlap there is with nutrient

580
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:47,460
spikes you know what I mean so for mine

581
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,319
the potassium will be like 70 000 which

582
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,000
will be really high because well it was

583
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,960
just grown in soils with a lot of

584
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,779
nutrients

585
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,700
and but his will still be thirty

586
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:59,519
thousand you know and the baseline's you

587
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,919
know like 10 PPM you know like it's like

588
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,859
right so there's like

589
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,659
relative spikes between all of the

590
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:07,859
nutrients that are higher in all the

591
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,919
main

592
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:13,019
groups of accumulators so I it's it's

593
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,820
cool for me because it's like a clear

594
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:17,519
correlation it's like okay well maybe

595
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:20,220
it's not sucking up like a ton ton

596
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,980
you're not you're not going to get an

597
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,839
exact value but you of like say

598
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,240
potassium but you know that comfrey is

599
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,859
going to have a high overall high level

600
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,558
of potassium

601
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:33,479
if you grow it and add it apply it I

602
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,779
guess so it's you know some I'm trying

603
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,419
to establish some baseline you know yeah

604
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:41,099
of that you know if I can that would be

605
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:44,100
cool and I want to write a book about it

606
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:46,019
that's fascinating to me and you know

607
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:47,459
I'm really interested to start taking a

608
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:49,139
look at some of this data and see the

609
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,480
relationships and these accumulators

610
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,460
between yeah related nutrients like

611
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,179
magnesium calcium and potassium they all

612
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,759
have such yeah a unique and integral

613
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,259
link together right because they bond at

614
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,298
the same sites within the plant roots

615
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:04,859
and kind of can cancel each other or

616
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:07,440
prevent each other from taking up

617
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:09,839
nutrients and you know reaching Peak

618
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,759
potential so yeah yeah that just and

619
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,319
then you know it's like because also I'm

620
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,940
just saying I mean I don't know but it's

621
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,980
like we got tons of land people there's

622
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,480
Fields all over the place like how

623
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,220
difficult would it be to just like plant

624
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,620
a field of comfrey and just go out and

625
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,900
harvest it for fertilizer you know what

626
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:26,939
I mean yeah like it's like free just

627
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,100
take it and try it and powder it and

628
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,900
just like add it to your soil mix I

629
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:32,879
don't know it's like I'm just saying

630
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,740
it's not necessarily

631
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,640
I don't know to me it just seems like a

632
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,740
free

633
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,440
free source of fertilizer potentially

634
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,200
well and potentially such a deep root

635
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,960
system that pulls roots or pulls

636
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,519
nutrients from down it elevates them to

637
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,100
the top and that's someone once

638
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,500
explained to me Casey yeah you can check

639
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:56,339
out an earlier episode Royal grown radio

640
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,779
with Casey from Phoenix Rising Farms up

641
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:00,599
in southern Oregon

642
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:03,418
he's got these comfrey plants that his

643
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:05,759
family have been in his family for like

644
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,259
70 or 100 years or something yeah and

645
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:11,298
from the Carolinas I want to say yeah

646
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:13,859
heirloom oh wild you know

647
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:15,538
strain and he's been propagating and his

648
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,240
family's been passing it down and his

649
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:19,079
explanation and I've heard it other ways

650
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,200
is

651
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:24,298
it's its job is to pull those deep

652
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,400
rooted nutrients that shallow rooted

653
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:28,259
plants can't access and it pulls them up

654
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,600
to the top and you chop it and drop it

655
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:32,099
and it creates it's nutrient cycling

656
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,740
through the layer of nutrient cycling

657
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:36,119
yeah I could see that that's yeah that's

658
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,558
the only thing I could see like over

659
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,418
time if you're like continuously

660
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,639
harvesting a field you might start

661
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:43,679
depleting all of the nutritive values

662
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,440
maybe over time you'd lose some of the

663
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,200
you know concentrations of of plant

664
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,720
fertilizer but I like I plant my country

665
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,058
next to my compost pile I have these I

666
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,860
have a boxing 14 but I got from flying

667
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:57,538
Blue Dog shout out to Rita and the

668
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:59,099
Flying Blue Dog ladies in Willow Creek

669
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:00,839
they're awesome they they have a big

670
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,599
herbal Farm too I've gotten a ton of

671
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,220
herbs from them yeah yeah I buy a lot of

672
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,339
stars in them every year yeah they're

673
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,100
they're awesome and and she gave me some

674
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:13,199
uh starts of this boxing 14 which is a

675
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:16,740
clumping comfrey yeah so it doesn't

676
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,480
spread like crazy I've had mine growing

677
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,819
next to my compost pile it's about the

678
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,220
size of this table people it's been like

679
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:25,740
that for about four or five years

680
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,240
and so it just like mines the new all

681
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,038
the nutrients that might get leached out

682
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,500
under the compost pile it just like

683
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,778
mine's that and I just chop it and put

684
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,278
it back in the compost pile for nutrient

685
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:38,640
cycling seems to work pretty well that's

686
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:42,720
cool yeah wow yeah I mean all of these

687
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,538
concepts are millennia's old but the

688
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,460
understanding is new the depth of the

689
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:49,740
understanding the ability to test the

690
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,600
nutrients to isolate these nutrients and

691
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:55,380
to start to do the sort of research that

692
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:58,259
you're talking about that's a fresh

693
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:01,140
thing we haven't had the science at our

694
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,940
fingertips to be like I've got a tissue

695
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,559
sample I want to know exactly what's in

696
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,058
this plant I'm actually at the same time

697
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,158
going to take a soil sample and know

698
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:10,019
what's exactly in the soil so I know

699
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,820
what the plant's taking up yeah yeah

700
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:14,519
what it's utilizing what it's leaving

701
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:17,460
behind and why and then you go to say

702
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,079
Earth Fort and do a biological assay and

703
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,940
you're like okay well look I've got all

704
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,000
this nitrogen my plant can't take it up

705
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,340
I'm missing these nitrogen cycling

706
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,220
pieces from my biology or you know just

707
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:32,399
one example of ways that modern science

708
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,740
is giving us the why behind yes things

709
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,140
that people have observed yes

710
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,659
observational science for Millennia and

711
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,538
now would be the time to plug if there's

712
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,278
any really rich philanthropist out there

713
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:46,440
let's start a research science

714
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:48,119
laboratory here in Humboldt where we can

715
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,919
study all this stuff so if you really

716
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,979
want to get into it

717
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,020
I'll be the lead scientist to run it and

718
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,960
we'll just start testing all we'll

719
00:27:55,019 --> 00:28:00,179
really that's that's really would be the

720
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,278
dream to just have like a research

721
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,259
science laboratory where you test all

722
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,019
this stuff out you know

723
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:08,819
like um Cutting Edge yeah it would be

724
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,679
dope you know it's like with the

725
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:14,038
Chrysanthemum flower you know that's

726
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,840
what perithrum comes from yeah and it's

727
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:19,679
like well can you just like grow this

728
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,720
flower and use it safely you know like

729
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,000
could you I don't know can you let's

730
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,220
find out right you would think that

731
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,259
aren't harmful to yeah Aquatic Life yeah

732
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,120
yeah yeah yeah yeah and it's like could

733
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:31,679
you I don't know could you well there's

734
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,019
only one way to find out and that's to

735
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,480
like run some research science on on

736
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,619
these topics you know it's it's tough I

737
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,900
mean obviously there is some science

738
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:41,819
involved in that you know for whatever

739
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,860
reason and obviously there could be a

740
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:45,538
monetary value behind it and there's a

741
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,879
business and so yeah it comes you know

742
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:49,679
Narrows that down yeah like but most of

743
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,260
our medicines out there from penicillin

744
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,000
to anticoagulation meds I mean it's all

745
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:55,379
plant-based yeah all of them are that's

746
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,179
what I tell people I'm like like you

747
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:01,460
guys don't realize like how much

748
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:04,860
science cops plant medicine field like

749
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,798
uh what's that Theraflu is from star

750
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:09,678
anise

751
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:13,679
aspirins from willow bark

752
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,500
tecnu the poison oak treatment is from a

753
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,778
plant called grindelia I believe or gum

754
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,339
gum weed that's the nickname I didn't

755
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:21,599
know that one yeah yeah that one's cool

756
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:23,398
we have that one growing it's really

757
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,019
cool we have this huge plant if you guys

758
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:26,398
are ever out in the summertime it's

759
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:29,158
really dope it's this huge yellow

760
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:32,278
beautiful bright yellow flowers and it

761
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,039
has a sticky super sticky white gummy

762
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,659
substance that's you you I guess make a

763
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,640
tincture with it and then it treats

764
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,200
poison oak but anyways it's

765
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,059
anticoagulation meds like Warfarin and

766
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,558
stuff like that that you know yeah my

767
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:45,240
dad had to take that one sure I mean

768
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:47,879
it's really common these days and that's

769
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,099
all from Clover yeah oh no kidding yeah

770
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,200
oh I did not know that that was that was

771
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:55,199
discovered by cows bleeding to death

772
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,880
internally oh funny because they ate too

773
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,640
much Clover interesting mind is blown

774
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,679
add one to the list cool yeah so you

775
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,559
know it's like plants

776
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,798
have all the answers we just need to

777
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:13,158
figure out what those answers are and we

778
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,259
don't need to rely so much on this like

779
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:18,539
pharmaceutical Matrix for telling us

780
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,919
what we need as far as they're really

781
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:22,079
helpful I'm not going to like totally

782
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,840
knock it because they like when they're

783
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:27,359
when they when like they're really good

784
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:30,240
for surgery they're really good for

785
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:33,058
technical highly technical surgeries

786
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,940
when it comes to internal medicine they

787
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:37,859
fail horribly it like with diet and

788
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,440
nutrition and health like sure they

789
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:43,379
don't they they get an F minus

790
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,538
for that understanding well I feel like

791
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,059
that's a lot to do with the isolation

792
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:50,398
you're you're recognizing oh this plant

793
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:53,158
does this but then you isolate a single

794
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,778
component or compound within that sure

795
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,120
plant and use it

796
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:59,220
as a medicine and you're no longer using

797
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,699
a whole plant medicine that's balanced

798
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,500
through Millennia of evolution totally

799
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,200
and that's just like the problem we're

800
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,898
having with cannabis in like uh was that

801
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,600
a pityolax or you know just like the THC

802
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:15,719
pills that they sure synthesize the

803
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:17,819
Marinol yeah the Marinol yeah yeah you

804
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,620
know oh yeah Felix I think is okay yeah

805
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:22,019
they tried 30 years ago that's what they

806
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:23,639
were married that was going to be the

807
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:25,379
answer yeah any kind of question for

808
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,520
medical marijuana yeah they thought that

809
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,840
that was just going to nip it in the bud

810
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,278
right there and obviously they were

811
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,199
wrong yeah because there was an entire

812
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,019
culture based around it like no other

813
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,659
plant I mean it wasn't an entire 30

814
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:39,778
years of black market sales of comfrey

815
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:41,580
and clover you know what I mean like so

816
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:44,159
that they're they and that's where it's

817
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:46,619
it's difficult because the Cannabis

818
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,299
culture it was market-based as well and

819
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:50,459
that's where plant medicines have always

820
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:52,379
fallen into that for the same reasons

821
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,179
where you have big Pharma you have

822
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,100
pharmaceutical companies and obviously

823
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:58,980
you know the scientists just can Zone in

824
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:01,379
on what plant is benefiting you know a

825
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,640
certain ailment or an illness and then

826
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,380
of course you know that's where they're

827
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,759
trying to tackle it yeah how do we

828
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,278
tackle this from a monetary and that's

829
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,140
the problem it's like Farmers the

830
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,119
science is really good for identifying

831
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,140
the compounds like without them we

832
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,538
probably wouldn't know all these

833
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,460
compounds in cannabis in the very good

834
00:32:15,538 --> 00:32:20,038
identifying that's where they come in

835
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,500
very valuable the money to identify the

836
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:24,359
compounds and to understand how they

837
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,398
interact with us but then when it comes

838
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,538
to the monetization it gets ruined it

839
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:28,918
yeah it gets around it's the same thing

840
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:31,740
that's happened with psychedelics right

841
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:35,159
now we all know that there's a power in

842
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:37,079
psychedelics and and mushrooms and and

843
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,480
and we're creeping down that road now

844
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,579
where so much is still way on not

845
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,099
understood and I don't think that my

846
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:45,119
ecology and mushrooms is going to be I

847
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,819
don't think it's as easy to understand

848
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,918
and break it down as as plants obviously

849
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:50,480
we know that there's a whole

850
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,159
communication

851
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,019
uh language that's happening under the

852
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,059
ground that you know might take us all a

853
00:32:55,019 --> 00:33:00,538
long time to really truly understand

854
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:02,639
that you know but as you as we start to

855
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:03,599
see this industry now unfolding around

856
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,659
that

857
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:09,298
you know it's got me a little uh

858
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:11,159
trepidatious about you know like how we

859
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:13,200
do this with such little knowledge when

860
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:15,059
it comes to that and as far as getting

861
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,440
into the wrong hands and and the wrong

862
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:17,819
you know

863
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,840
um intentions

864
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:23,579
you know yes yes it's all valid concerns

865
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,980
well and

866
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:27,960
the the interesting part of that to me

867
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,519
is

868
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,319
finding the balance between a plant

869
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,298
being illegal or a fungus or whatever

870
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,519
being completely illegal so there's no

871
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:39,058
research happening there's no

872
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,220
you know motion forward in the general

873
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:42,960
populace understanding how it benefits

874
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,480
Humanity

875
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,480
and then it goes to regulation

876
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,640
and instead of improving that

877
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,120
information it becomes stifled in a

878
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,778
different way because it's focused

879
00:33:54,119 --> 00:34:00,000
in a unique way to to control yes it's

880
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:04,079
hoarded the knowledge becomes hoarded to

881
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,538
control the outcomes yeah exactly yes so

882
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,759
it's like basically the freedom of the

883
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:10,800
plant was made criminal or the fungus

884
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,720
what have you and then it becomes

885
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,700
regulated and stifled on this greater

886
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,098
level and like how do we get back to a

887
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:19,319
Freedom of Information and research to

888
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:22,760
actually get the truth behind these

889
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:26,000
compounds at a larger level

890
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:29,099
citizen science some type of like

891
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,320
Collective Union of you know concerned

892
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:34,859
citizens that pool money to perform

893
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:37,980
independent research perhaps citizen

894
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:40,139
science what a great segue for me to ask

895
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,679
you a little more about the cha

896
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,480
education platform oh sure the entirety

897
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,960
of the kind of concept of that business

898
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,358
so tell us for those of you that do that

899
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,820
don't know what chai is it's cannabis

900
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:57,480
Horticultural Association yep

901
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,039
cha colloquially known as cha just for

902
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,280
fun but yeah the Cannabis Horticultural

903
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:05,699
Association was founded in 2016.

904
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,619
and it was founded to essentially create

905
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:10,739
a platform to promote organic and

906
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:13,140
ecological management for cannabis okay

907
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:16,139
to and I built it it was going to be

908
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:18,358
well it still is is a website it has a

909
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:20,400
membership you sign up to be a member

910
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,199
and then you get access to this database

911
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,660
and it's essentially like an online book

912
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,419
that's I'm able to you know populate

913
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,799
with new data as it emerges I've been

914
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,780
working on that

915
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,579
I'll admit the last few years have been

916
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,700
rough and I haven't updated it as much

917
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:38,579
as I should but it still contains uh

918
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:41,279
quite a bit of knowledge and it's still

919
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:43,500
being updated pretty regularly

920
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,380
when I can and um

921
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,019
you know I I really see this as a long

922
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,599
long standing project I modeled it after

923
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:53,880
The Royal Horticultural Society because

924
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,338
this was an association or a society

925
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,200
that was been around for 100 years you

926
00:35:56,338 --> 00:36:01,799
know and it's for promoting plant

927
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:04,739
science and I hadn't seen anything like

928
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,660
this in cannabis and I wanted to create

929
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:08,399
something that was unique and and

930
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:09,779
something that meant meant something to

931
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,139
me in terms of

932
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,019
so what type of world I want to see

933
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:18,420
exist in the future for my kids which is

934
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:20,338
you know organic or ecological or

935
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,559
regenerative you can just like label it

936
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:24,838
one of those words I've started leaning

937
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,460
towards ecological because other words

938
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:29,820
are you know a little bit loaded

939
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:32,880
sometimes people you know always like oh

940
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,800
well organic is like just a USD label or

941
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,480
regenerative there's no definition it's

942
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,760
subjective yeah it's a subjective thing

943
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,179
and it's hard to quite pin that down but

944
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,780
anyways all that aside I created it to

945
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:48,179
do just that which is educate and

946
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,560
promote these these Concepts and

947
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:52,980
hopefully

948
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,539
as this Association grows I'll be able

949
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,159
to have more and more research money

950
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:57,659
where I can actually conduct more and

951
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,879
more research science like that's really

952
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:02,159
what I want to do I do want to set this

953
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,200
up to be like the consumer reports for

954
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,679
cannabis we're like we can like test

955
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:11,879
products be like okay like let's test Dr

956
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:13,078
Earth's powder versus green you know uh

957
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,119
what's the other company I can't

958
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:16,980
remember green group yeah thank you like

959
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,960
let's just like test like friendly

960
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,880
competition like let's like test these

961
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,260
products out and like test them out

962
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,119
against each other and see how they

963
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,220
perform and then like do side by sides

964
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,680
and have like you know research science

965
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:30,358
are like let's see what happens if you

966
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,578
know a plant gets infested with spider

967
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:35,460
mites like can we how do we treat it

968
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:36,780
with let's see about uh this persimilus

969
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,440
you might

970
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,420
um Can it withstand Bavaria basiana as

971
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,519
well if we have this aphid problem you

972
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:48,059
know like try to test some of like the

973
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:51,119
more complex science behind bio merging

974
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:53,099
bio controls in horticult culture and

975
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,519
that's what I'd like to see long term

976
00:37:53,099 --> 00:38:00,180
with this you know this business I love

977
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:02,699
it it's an enduring tribute to the you

978
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:05,519
know grander scheme of the plant and

979
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:06,239
cultivation I think I really love that

980
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,280
and

981
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,479
personally that really speaks to me I do

982
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,820
a lot of the research and development

983
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:17,400
for Royal gold so it's always about

984
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:20,160
accelerating the knowledge and changing

985
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,780
the game I there's no need or desire to

986
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,519
try and do what other people are doing

987
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,820
let's find a new way to do it

988
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:28,440
differently not necessarily better not

989
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,240
necessarily worse but let's do it

990
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,980
different let's find different ways to

991
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,459
create new expressions of the plants

992
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:38,579
yeah and to feed the biology and the

993
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,338
entirety yes of you know

994
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:44,519
the yeah how do we optimize plant growth

995
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:47,820
with the combination of biology and

996
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:50,460
chemistry how do we do that very

997
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,559
succinctly put I like that yeah yeah

998
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,119
yeah and that's come a long way when you

999
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,299
look at the the Cannabis industry

1000
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,760
already in the last 15 or 20 years

1001
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,339
the way we've figured out how to grow

1002
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,119
cannabis definitely is has definitely

1003
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:08,279
opened up some eyes in big AG you know

1004
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,720
they've learned a lot from us yeah and

1005
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,200
see that's another thing like another

1006
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:14,899
window in the Cannabis is open not

1007
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:18,779
identifying pesticides herbal medicine

1008
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:22,079
just practice biological practices ways

1009
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:26,220
to streamline nutrient management for

1010
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,560
sure it's another awareness period you

1011
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:29,819
know a big AG man they've just yeah it

1012
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,799
was a world that they really weren't

1013
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,140
familiar with yeah until a couple years

1014
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,960
ago oh man a couple decades ago yeah

1015
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:39,900
they're freaking killing soil and

1016
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,780
producing cardboard plants and there's

1017
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,880
so much more to it than that yeah it's

1018
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,579
so true that's another system of control

1019
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,280
if if you kill everything off

1020
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:53,280
and destroy the cycling then you become

1021
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,339
dependent on the supplier to put new

1022
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,339
available form of this nutrient back in

1023
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:01,920
the soil so it's essentially control and

1024
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:05,099
you know that that biological feedback

1025
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,320
loop keeps forcing larger and larger

1026
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,619
consumption of nitrate nitrates

1027
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:13,140
nitrogens potassium

1028
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:16,200
you just triggered a very deep level of

1029
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:18,659
awareness Beyond because I had thought

1030
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:21,539
about that in terms of the human aspect

1031
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:23,879
but I did not consider that for the

1032
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:26,820
Earth aspect and it's creating this

1033
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,220
interesting merging of awareness now I

1034
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,220
get it well and tie it back to fossil

1035
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,500
fuels where are all of the nitrogen

1036
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:36,179
sources coming from for commercial

1037
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,960
agriculture

1038
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:41,419
it's all this oh that's the depth the

1039
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,460
depth timer

1040
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:47,519
I forgot to shut it off I've done that

1041
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:51,179
before I'm like I'm on airplane mode oh

1042
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:53,759
this is my take the laundry out yeah and

1043
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:55,500
shut it off from the fall well lucky you

1044
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,960
you're not pulling tarps right now no

1045
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,179
thank God that was the alarm to be like

1046
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,858
congratulations yeah yeah I kept it on

1047
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:04,039
just like you may yeah it was like a

1048
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:07,259
victory alarm yep exactly

1049
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:10,259
yeah have a drink and relax and just

1050
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,660
yeah but yeah I hear you man so it's all

1051
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,180
that nitrogen's coming out of the fossil

1052
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:19,199
fuel industry yeah the blue nitrogen

1053
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:22,679
coming from natural gas refinement and

1054
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,480
so it's so ubiquitous

1055
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,338
um you know go to this

1056
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,800
um you know fertilizer conference every

1057
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:30,420
year app go it's you know the

1058
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,300
association of fertilizer producers

1059
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,920
basically and you know go in we're

1060
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,900
sitting down at these meetings you know

1061
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,639
because it helps us understand how to

1062
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,099
label products and create new products

1063
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:44,219
within the system that's allowed in ways

1064
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:47,579
to label and create new things

1065
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:50,338
and just standing there sitting and you

1066
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:51,359
see the lobbying happening in these

1067
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:54,000
meetings

1068
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,400
for blue nitrogen and for fossil fuel

1069
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,559
products and you see

1070
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,280
the kind of behind the scenes workings

1071
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:04,858
manipulating the regulation bodies to

1072
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,900
lean towards these types of products and

1073
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:09,059
it's it's just fascinating to me coming

1074
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,858
from a world of yeah you know fighting

1075
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,358
against these systems and then going and

1076
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:14,159
sitting in these meetings and being like

1077
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:16,739
Oh my God it's real it's happening you

1078
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,618
get to see it the real it's like an idea

1079
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:21,838
until you're actually there watching it

1080
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:24,480
happen yeah it's a conspiracy theory

1081
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,039
until you see it happen yeah yeah if

1082
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,900
you've always often joke I heard some

1083
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,239
rapper recently is like joking around

1084
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,858
it's like people always like talk about

1085
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,739
conspiracy theories and it's like

1086
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:36,739
there's unions all the time working you

1087
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:40,078
know lobbyists working to like con

1088
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:42,118
conspire to create rules and regulations

1089
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,300
like it's not that outside the scope of

1090
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,099
reality to consider like how much

1091
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,800
conspiring actually occurs like

1092
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:51,720
absolutely it's like it's a joke if you

1093
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,060
think about it like it's of course it's

1094
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:56,279
of course it's going on right and that's

1095
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:58,019
where I think you know associations

1096
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,839
foundations

1097
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:02,940
collaborations

1098
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:04,500
like the Cannabis Horticultural

1099
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:08,519
Association

1100
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:12,239
placed such an important role like

1101
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,619
some of these enduring bodies things are

1102
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,379
kind of feeding the comments I just

1103
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:18,480
gotta I just gotta I gotta bear down and

1104
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,940
like I've been in my little bubble like

1105
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,219
metaphorically like building the root

1106
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,920
system and now I think we're ready to

1107
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:27,838
like grow and go you know on the

1108
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,940
national level and they need to figure

1109
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,500
out a way to probably create like

1110
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,179
chapters

1111
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,739
you know in each state probably

1112
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:37,919
something like that has been rattling

1113
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:40,139
around in a subconscious and figure out

1114
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,659
who's going to run the chapters and then

1115
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:44,699
that way we can pull resources and

1116
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,078
collectively build if I could do that we

1117
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:47,519
could collectively build the information

1118
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,260
on the website it will grow

1119
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,300
significantly faster

1120
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,619
so I'm trying to I need to figure out I

1121
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,119
think it's an important thing you know I

1122
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:56,400
mean coming out of Humboldt obviously

1123
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,200
you know we've always been kind of a

1124
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,139
leaders in

1125
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:03,118
in cannabis everything yeah I mean

1126
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:05,699
honestly we just got we saw you down the

1127
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,440
emerald cup you know Emerald cup was

1128
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:09,059
it was a testament to that I felt like

1129
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,858
there were Growers from all over the

1130
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:12,299
country and so many of these new states

1131
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:13,619
that have gone legal and changed their

1132
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:17,220
laws recently

1133
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:20,519
and I and I kind of enjoy it and and was

1134
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:22,980
uh I adored the idea that some so many

1135
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:26,099
of them felt the need to come humble

1136
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,539
yeah and and to tap in to be like you

1137
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,700
know hey if we're gonna do this here in

1138
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:31,019
New York or oh yeah Missouri or

1139
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:33,679
something like that where else to go

1140
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:35,780
than to tap in

1141
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,818
Trumbull County Northern California

1142
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,079
Emerald cup and talk to Growers and talk

1143
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:42,059
to some of the companies that have been

1144
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,000
around since the beginning and and the

1145
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:46,858
network and and also to feel the culture

1146
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,480
you know I think that there's a big part

1147
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:51,539
there not everybody in every new state

1148
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,179
is uh an MSO looking for for the next

1149
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:57,059
best uh you know publicly traded

1150
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:58,980
cannabis company a lot of them are

1151
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:00,480
getting into it in their state and

1152
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,639
really wanting it to be a part of the

1153
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,440
old cannabis culture

1154
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,000
um that we've had here for 40 or 50

1155
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,220
years you know and I think there's no

1156
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,780
place in the emerald Cup in a lot of

1157
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:11,219
ways to go in a tap into that and

1158
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,339
experience that and see what it's like

1159
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:16,679
and I mean the industry is you know it's

1160
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:19,318
not at its best right now Market wise

1161
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,838
especially and people are struggling but

1162
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:23,940
you wouldn't have necessarily known that

1163
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:25,799
or felt that at the emerald cup no it's

1164
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,559
pretty vibing this year rainbows and

1165
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,359
unicorns last year was a bit like shaky

1166
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,099
but this year I talked to people it

1167
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:35,880
seemed like way more stable sales were

1168
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:37,920
up at least from some reports yeah so I

1169
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,740
think you know overall it seems like a

1170
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,119
good rebound so far and I agree with you

1171
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:45,118
I think

1172
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,599
Humboldt is the it's the epicenter of

1173
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,640
this whole explosion it's like the micro

1174
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:53,579
the the the the the root the fungal

1175
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,199
Network that like sporulates out I mean

1176
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:57,839
the whole Pacific I shouldn't just say

1177
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:00,000
homo because I got friends it's really

1178
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,779
the Pacific Northwest from British

1179
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,358
Columbia to Humboldt it's like the micro

1180
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:08,359
belt even down yeah

1181
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,480
I don't want to single eye because then

1182
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,699
you get people you know it's like it's

1183
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,818
like more of a metaphor like because I I

1184
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:19,500
obviously favorite favoritism to the

1185
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:21,239
place where I live but but you're

1186
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,880
absolutely right this whole sort of band

1187
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:25,679
along the Pacific Northwest is this like

1188
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,480
epis and then humble almost as like this

1189
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,239
because we're near the Redwoods it's

1190
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,099
like maybe the center of it well we were

1191
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:33,659
obviously pushing out the majority of

1192
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:35,220
the weight that was going out to the

1193
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:36,779
rest of the world indeed for the most

1194
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:38,159
part I mean Mendo and Trinity were in

1195
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,500
there and obviously you can do you can

1196
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,318
throw Monterey and Sonoma and everywhere

1197
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,480
Southern Oregon you know yeah but Weight

1198
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:47,460
Wise I don't think anybody that's not

1199
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,079
even a bait I don't think right I mean

1200
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,059
I'm almost definitely kicking out the

1201
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,160
majority of the weight yeah so and

1202
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:55,078
people would recognize it and I mean I

1203
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:56,699
remember going back to Virginia

1204
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,900
10 years ago and be like oh where are

1205
00:46:56,699 --> 00:47:00,419
you from I'm like humble and they're

1206
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,818
like oh you know just immediately it's

1207
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,960
like oh you're weed you know you don't

1208
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:06,599
have to say anything you just said

1209
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,179
humble and it was like oh weed yep it's

1210
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,740
just like known yeah people stop you on

1211
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:12,059
the streets if you have Humboldt on your

1212
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:14,399
hat or your shirt and they're like oh

1213
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:15,838
humble huh yeah hey we have made and

1214
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,160
humbled on the back of our shirts I

1215
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,980
can't tell you how many times I was at a

1216
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:22,019
restaurant somewhere out way far from

1217
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,400
this place and somebody would come up to

1218
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:25,619
the restaurant and see the back of my

1219
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,720
shirt and have to ask me about it you

1220
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:29,880
know yeah exactly and so it's really

1221
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,159
interesting and you know one thing that

1222
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,838
kind of drives me crazy and I'm not

1223
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,000
trying to take direct shots but the

1224
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:39,059
Humboldt tourism Board needs to get

1225
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,719
their heads together and recognize that

1226
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:45,539
this community is going to benefit from

1227
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:48,858
Cannabis tourism and there's this

1228
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:51,779
problem and they just need to recognize

1229
00:47:48,858 --> 00:47:54,420
that they need to incorporate the

1230
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:56,940
Cannabis community and not ostracize

1231
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,500
them for for some perception of some old

1232
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,358
way of life because there's plenty of

1233
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,699
old people here that also support

1234
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:04,318
cannabis yeah and I don't know I've just

1235
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:07,259
heard you know I've heard it they're not

1236
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:09,300
very friendly to cannabis and it drives

1237
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,579
me crazy yeah it hasn't really started

1238
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,818
very you know I mean you think at this

1239
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:17,400
what are we five five years past yeah 64

1240
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:19,679
just about three four years

1241
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,599
you know we've been talking about that

1242
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,759
for 10 years I mean there was talk about

1243
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,140
you know cannabis farm tours and the bus

1244
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,680
that goes up the hill and takes you to

1245
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:30,420
three Farms on one Hill and and yeah and

1246
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:33,059
it hasn't really happened they could

1247
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:35,519
just make an ad like show the redwoods

1248
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:37,559
in the in Patrick's Point and like smoke

1249
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,539
weed come to Humboldt and just get

1250
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,659
really High Grade weed from the farms

1251
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:44,699
and have a good vacation and it's like

1252
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:47,098
you can tap it into some culinary stuff

1253
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:49,980
yeah with the Avenue of the Giants yeah

1254
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,920
and the seafood with the ocean and just

1255
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,539
like oh man it would be so easy to do I

1256
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,760
really feel like

1257
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:58,980
so many farms

1258
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,500
and Mom and Pop

1259
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:04,440
people that would have survived this

1260
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:07,380
falling out of the Cannabis industry

1261
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,240
didn't because people haven't acted fast

1262
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,940
enough on some of these Concepts the

1263
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:14,399
people that had you know a small

1264
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,260
Greenhouse but extensive Gardens and

1265
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,019
produce most of their own food who

1266
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,880
aren't growing cannabis anymore because

1267
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:23,219
they just can't yeah they lost their

1268
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,760
licenses didn't get the license

1269
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:28,379
etc etc we've yeah as a community in a

1270
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,000
large way turned our back on the

1271
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,640
Heritage that these people brought us

1272
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,460
yes and it has affected their ability to

1273
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,500
hold on and contribute yeah I agree I

1274
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,960
have a lot to say about that actually

1275
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,780
um maybe in as few words but you know

1276
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,119
from my there are certain members of the

1277
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,760
community you know in positions of power

1278
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,338
or influence that you know always even

1279
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,319
just member community members always you

1280
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:54,659
know they ripped the humble Community

1281
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:57,059
because of these grow dozers and Hill

1282
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,559
grows and like big money and they're

1283
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:00,900
just like spending money and then

1284
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,139
leaving and going to Costa Rica which

1285
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:06,599
did exist it was your thing but what

1286
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:09,659
they didn't realize is that there's

1287
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:13,200
actually a proportionately much higher

1288
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:15,420
number of Growers that are just families

1289
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,639
and they're community members that are

1290
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,920
serving the fire departments and the

1291
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:23,279
local soccer leagues and the local

1292
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,800
community centers and the businesses and

1293
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,440
and the schools and they're donating

1294
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,720
their volunteer time to all of these

1295
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:34,500
organizations that are fueling our

1296
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:37,139
social network and and they don't and

1297
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,940
and so and the problem also then existed

1298
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:41,759
in the permitting regulations where a

1299
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:43,679
lot of them lived in on pieces of land

1300
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,540
that weren't able to get these permits

1301
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,940
they should have set up some type of

1302
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:50,159
variance permitting that allowed like

1303
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,659
neighbors to agree or you know something

1304
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:53,480
there should have been a better

1305
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:55,920
permeating system for small-scale

1306
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,079
cultivators and Humboldt and and then

1307
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,740
you know having some type of collective

1308
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,720
you know group of them come together

1309
00:51:00,739 --> 00:51:06,000
might have been a better situation but

1310
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:08,279
it didn't happen and it's tough it comes

1311
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,780
from years of everybody not necessarily

1312
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,900
you know

1313
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,339
working as a unit you know what I mean I

1314
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,599
mean for for the longest time even if

1315
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:18,299
you're friends with your neighbors on

1316
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,338
the hill you know you still for the most

1317
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,559
part you'd keep your distance you didn't

1318
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:23,578
necessarily want to tie in or be too

1319
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,599
close to the neighbor because you never

1320
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:26,099
know what's going to happen with that

1321
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,359
neighbor yeah or who the workers that

1322
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:29,519
they were going to have over that year

1323
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:32,460
or maybe they're going to get busted and

1324
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:36,780
Lead over to you I mean there was still

1325
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:38,699
a very you know private yeah I'm doing

1326
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,579
my thing over here you know and that's

1327
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:44,759
tough because we needed so much more of

1328
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:46,500
a Cooperative relationship yeah with

1329
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,760
everybody right out of the gates and I

1330
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,280
think because it was every man for

1331
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,440
themselves for the most part that we

1332
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,660
didn't have yeah that maybe the voice

1333
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,460
The Voice putting that towards the

1334
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:57,719
community no one wanted to talk because

1335
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,240
they didn't want to we're all scared to

1336
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:02,578
death then you get abated oh you're who

1337
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,399
right here's your abatement I know like

1338
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:08,519
yeah well again it's a systemic and

1339
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,200
systematic oppression by separating and

1340
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:12,719
dividing the people that created the

1341
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:16,039
culture to try and keep them from

1342
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:19,019
growing enough yeah to actually Ascend

1343
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:21,599
and when it got past the point of no

1344
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:24,480
return then it was regulated in a way

1345
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:29,000
that kept them out of the new system

1346
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:33,240
yeah and it it really basically

1347
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,059
set up the failure of all of these farms

1348
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:39,299
and it's limiting the knowledge it's

1349
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:41,880
limiting the community and it's allowing

1350
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:45,599
big money and big agriculture to take

1351
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:49,740
over what community yeah created and

1352
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:51,900
it's really sad and baffling but I think

1353
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:54,239
we do have a voice and we do have a way

1354
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:56,099
to continue to grow this community amen

1355
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,318
and to bring it back and change

1356
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:00,300
culturally from the inside out these

1357
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,519
systems that tried to oppress it in the

1358
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,260
first place I like that I think that's a

1359
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:07,259
positive outlook and I fully support

1360
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:09,000
that it's sure not going to be easy no

1361
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,160
but we have to work together and that's

1362
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,099
the key I think now

1363
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:17,460
we're a tight enough unit

1364
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:19,440
that were like so when I went to this

1365
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:23,099
showing of tending the garden that movie

1366
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:26,099
so sad I missed that that was put on by

1367
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:28,500
you know Claire and Jesse and those guys

1368
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:30,359
everyone in that theater it was like it

1369
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,280
was it was really interesting because a

1370
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:34,739
lot of those people I knew and some of

1371
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,140
them I had never met before but it was

1372
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:40,799
it was a giant family it didn't matter

1373
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:44,578
it was basically if you are here now

1374
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,440
you were a family and we're here to help

1375
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:48,660
like it doesn't matter who you are or

1376
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,579
what our differences have been like if

1377
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:53,460
you made it this far like we're here to

1378
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:56,818
like Network together and and provide

1379
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:59,818
resources and put pool resources and

1380
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:01,858
share information and figure out a way

1381
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:04,318
we can make this work that's literally

1382
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:06,539
where I feel like from the small scale

1383
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:09,239
farm that's where we're at in Humboldt

1384
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:11,699
is like everyone's here to just band

1385
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:13,858
together now at this point against the

1386
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:15,719
big corporates man that's so amazing I

1387
00:54:13,858 --> 00:54:17,400
was talking to Jesse about the event and

1388
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:19,618
the way you just described it really

1389
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,200
kind of summed up what he was saying

1390
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:24,000
nice in a whole different way and you

1391
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:26,279
know it was really special it was really

1392
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,420
awesome I was like I felt like I don't

1393
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,700
know it was a really cool connection

1394
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,440
like I felt like we've made it this far

1395
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:33,179
yeah we can make it the rest of the way

1396
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,800
yeah exactly and I wish there was a way

1397
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:36,539
to like you know

1398
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,818
lock in some of the funds that have been

1399
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,318
allocated to helping Humboldt County in

1400
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:41,880
the Emerald Triangle because there are a

1401
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,920
lot of funds out there

1402
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,619
and some of it's been used in Sacramento

1403
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,240
you know to keep in state hasn't really

1404
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:50,039
we haven't gotten anywhere there's still

1405
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,539
I think probably half the counties in

1406
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:53,818
California that still really don't allow

1407
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:55,558
any right cannabis or dispensaries or

1408
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:58,858
anything like that the outdoor Market

1409
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,960
you know in the major cities in in San

1410
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:03,739
Francisco and L.A you know it's it's

1411
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,679
always been favorable towards Endor yeah

1412
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:09,899
you the way out is to go over out of

1413
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,460
state to go to be allowed to sell your

1414
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,220
product throughout the entire rest of

1415
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:16,139
the country is it possible to secure

1416
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:17,879
some of those funds and actually have a

1417
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:19,379
Lobby you were saying every industry's

1418
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,420
got a Lobby and they're all making these

1419
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,640
deals and right I mean that's exactly

1420
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,099
what the Emerald Triangle needs but it

1421
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:27,719
has to go to Washington yeah I mean I

1422
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:30,000
feel like that's the only way forward is

1423
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:32,159
to be able to because yeah this flower

1424
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,480
is completely in high demand for the

1425
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,039
rest of the country it's just something

1426
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,900
yeah for sure California and you just

1427
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,818
got to figure out right you get the

1428
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,780
group together then you have to figure

1429
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:42,599
out

1430
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:44,280
because collectively it would be nice

1431
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:47,280
but probably still low on the money

1432
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:50,280
monetary end of influence so to speak

1433
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,380
then you'd have to figure out some type

1434
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,619
of incentive what incentive are you

1435
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,660
going to give to the congressman I mean

1436
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:59,220
this is how it works exactly I mean like

1437
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:02,279
what are you gonna do oh well we have

1438
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:03,598
this app that you know if downloaded

1439
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,880
then we'll allow interstate commerce

1440
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,338
we'll give you a percentage of the app

1441
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,740
right it's very words like you know like

1442
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:12,719
that's just a stupid way Congress works

1443
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:14,159
and it's unfortunate but that's like

1444
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,500
play the game if you want to play the

1445
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,598
game like figure that out you got to pay

1446
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,920
to play it's crazy but I mean that's

1447
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:21,599
something that you know if that had

1448
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,760
happened even just a couple years ago as

1449
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,200
all these new States go legal you know

1450
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,520
it's an amazing thing so many of them

1451
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:28,558
don't have any kind of history in

1452
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:30,179
cultivating themselves you could still

1453
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,880
probably allow a home grow as part of

1454
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:35,940
your legislation that passes but for the

1455
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,099
actual overall populist Market of each

1456
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:40,380
of these states you know right up into

1457
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:42,780
places like New York you you know what I

1458
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,579
mean like you could probably just go out

1459
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,800
open up dispensers everywhere and not

1460
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:49,019
really even have a cultivation part of

1461
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,519
the bill knowing that you could be

1462
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:52,500
supplied from a place like California

1463
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:54,719
whether it's indoor Greenhouse like that

New York and all the other states too we

1466
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:00,599
got you right you know but as if we're

1467

still legal and you can't go over over

1468
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:05,280
state lines every state that goes legal

1469
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,260
