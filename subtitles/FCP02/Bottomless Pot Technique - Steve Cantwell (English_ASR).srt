1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,920
hey everybody this is steve cantwell

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,160
i want to share a bottomless pot

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,960
technique with you guys um this is our

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
27th cycle um this planted earlier today

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,480
i had my growers take me one bed just to

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,439
demonstrate this for everybody hope you

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
guys enjoy

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,920
all right so this is one of our beds

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,160
after a cycle

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,719
and what you're seeing here is two

11
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,519
cycles worth of pots on top of the soil

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,920
and i'll explain the reason behind that

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,840
so this pot here with less dichondra has

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,600
less cover crop in it um this is from

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,239
the cycle the last cycle that was just

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,120
harvested um you can see here the same

17
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,279
thing

18
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,759
let me skip one and go here

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,280
and what we do is we create a grid

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,759
of 18

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,399
and or 12 plants per cycle so this one

22
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,198
is a 12 grid plant so if you look 1 2 3

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,719
4

24
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,759
5 6

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:10,560
7 8 9 10 11 12. that's all one grid and

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,359
then this is at my 18 plant grid one two

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,200
three

28
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:19,118
four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,840
13 14 15 16 17 18. and what i do is i

30
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,280
use this grid to rotate my crops so

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,200
basically

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
my indica dominant strains for the most

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,799
part will take 18 plants

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,799
a bed to fill the canopy in the amount

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
of time i have to fill the canopy

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,680
whereas the 12

37
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,478
grid plants are like more sativa if you

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
will

39
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,920
in structure and they only take 12

40
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,478
plants

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,960
to fill the canopy in the space i have

42
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,920
on the time i have allocated for veg

43
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,199
so

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,000
by by putting the 18 versus 12 on every

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,159
other cycle i'm forcing myself to rotate

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,920
my strain to rotate my crop if you will

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,560
so i'm not growing the same cannabis

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,040
variety in the same bed over and over

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,879
again and potentially stripping the soil

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,719
of what it is that that plant you know

51
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,359
actually likes

52
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,038
so what we're going to do today is

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,840
we're going to remove

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,399
uh the the pot from two cycles ago and

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,560
replace it with a fresh plant again this

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,800
is the pot that was just harvested we're

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,640
gonna give it one cycle to break down

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,439
and then this is the pot from one cycle

59
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,279
ago

60
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,959
that's ready now the reason we do this

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,520
is because if i were to try to remove

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,199
this pot with fresh roots it's it's

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,719
already it's still anchored to the bed

64
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,039
this will create a big mess a big

65
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,519
disturbance and to be a lot more work

66
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,359
whereas this pot that had a cycle to

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,800
break down its roots are broken down it

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,400
lifts right up

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,239
with minimal mess minimal disturbance

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,480
couple things to take into consideration

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,239
if you're going to try this out with by

72
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,159
cutting the bottoms of your old pots out

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,959
definitely do it before you plant into

74
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,680
those pots don't grow in pots with

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,519
bottoms and then cut it out um

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
because you're going to shock the plant

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,080
by doing that

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,959
and you're going to

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,760
only get the benefit of not having to

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,598
dig holes versus the less transplant

81
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,318
shock um so if you want to get the full

82
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,878
benefits of it both less reduce labor

83
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:18,318
and reduce transplant shock then cut the

84
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,919
bottoms of your pots out before um

85
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,439
planting into them before planting your

86
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:26,079
clones or your seed into them um also uh

87
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,598
if you go with uh grass roots like these

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
are grass roots pots if you go with

89
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,959
grass root pots

90
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,640
over um a plastic pot the plastic pots

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,239
will hold moisture a little bit longer

92
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,158
on top of the soil so you can just water

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,680
them every other day where the grass

94
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,399
roots pots you're going to want to water

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
them um almost every day the first like

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
five to seven days until their roots

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,759
start to transform

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,318
okay guys so check it out

99
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,639
all i'm gonna do is pull up on this pot

100
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,719
i could already feel it just lightly

101
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,839
ripping off the soil

102
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,039
then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take

103
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,438
my hand put my hand underneath it

104
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,878
and lift up

105
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,959
all the old grooves everything's there

106
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,959
intact then i just take this i'm going

107
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,400
to throw it in a wheelbarrow and that

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,598
way i can harden off and put it into a

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,599
tote and then reuse it

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
now i'm going to take

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,879
the

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,600
the fresh pot one thing you want to do

113
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,918
um is not water these pots the day of

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
planting i think my growers pranked me

115
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,918
knowing i was gonna do this video and

116
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
they heavily watered these pots

117
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,159
um

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
before leaving them for me

119
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,279
it just makes it heavier a little bit

120
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,839
more challenging but this is basically

121
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,839
what you're gonna get

122
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,638
wiggle it into place

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,919
if you have time kind of push the molds

124
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,240
up against it

125
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,639
but that's basically as simple as it is

126
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,960
um you remove one and you replace it

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,199
with another it's about as easy as it

128
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,198
gets uh again i'm not digging a hole and

129
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,879
having to move a bunch of soil i'm just

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,160
lifting one pot and putting back another

131
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,478
one

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,080
so this is the pot that we just removed

133
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,000
uh one thing i wanted to kind of talk

134
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,599
about was the potential um we haven't

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
done this yet but the potential to

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,479
remove it and place it directly on a

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,959
saucer and plant directly into it again

138
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,959
without having to dump and mix

139
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,879
i'm not sure if this is the best idea

140
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,239
for you know 20 cycles

141
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,680
but something if everything's running

142
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,519
smoothly you might be able to get away

143
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,199
with for you know two three maybe four

144
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,079
cycles before having to actually dump

145
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,680
this out and re-amend your best mix

146
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,959
if it calls for it um so it's just

147
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,319
something to think about again i'm not

148
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,839
sure if this is the direction that this

149
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,839
tech is gonna go

150
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,000
so now i'm going to show you guys how to

151
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,839
fill these bottomless pots in case you

152
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,399
ain't figured out yet um so you're going

153
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,160
to take a saucer and take an empty pot

154
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,360
place on top of the saucer i'm doing

155
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,879
this with one hand obviously i'm

156
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,959
recording um they're just going to fill

157
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,958
the pot

158
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,680
you'll want to then shake your pot make

159
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,000
sure if it settles

160
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,239
leave a little bit of room for a walk to

161
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,480
catch water and top dress

162
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,879
and then basically

163
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,560
plug your clone so one question i get

164
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,320
asked a lot is how to take care of the

165
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,319
bottomless pots prior to placing them on

166
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,600
the beds um so as you can see here we're

167
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,760
just sitting on a rack on a saucer under

168
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,480
some led lights um they're here for

169
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,559
about

170
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,800
two to three weeks just to get some size

171
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,119
get some root growth um we water them

172
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,719
about every other day um

173
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,839
you know they we call it rain we just

174
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,920
rain on them

175
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,880
from time to time but for the most part

176
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,399
um

177
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:11,120
treat it like you would any other pot

178
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,958
i just want to close out this video um

179
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,919
by reiterating some things that i talked

180
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,399
about

181
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,319
first off keep in mind again that this

182
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,480
technique was designed for commercial

183
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,639
scale to reduce labor

184
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,360
along the way we discovered some

185
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,839
benefits as far as less plant shock that

186
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,360
anyone can benefit from at any scale

187
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,680
so just keep in mind that that's the

188
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,839
main focus of this so if you're having a

189
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,239
one lighter at home and you like digging

190
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,560
holes more power to you

191
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,879
keep in mind our soil is well maintained

192
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,159
well aerated um

193
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,639
we're going to grow healthy plants

194
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,000
regardless this is mainly for us in our

195
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,519
situation

196
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
to reduce the amount of labor going in

197
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,320
and out of each one

198
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,799
another thing if you go with the

199
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,360
grassroots fabric bottomless pots um

200
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,120
versus a hard pot with a cut out bottom

201
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,639
keep in mind with the grass root pots

202
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,278
you're gonna have to water a little more

203
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,399
frequently i'd say uh at first every day

204
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,159
every other day

205
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,480
um and then once the roots sow

206
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,639
themselves into the beds uh as long as

207
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,039
the beds are moist and wet you're good

208
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,639
but again the first five seven maybe

209
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,399
seven to ten days uh you're going to

210
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,879
want to make sure every day every other

211
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,720
day um we've kissed the top of the pots

212
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,958
with some water

213
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,959
just until they sew into the vents

214
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,278
one more thing i i can't say for sure

215
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,958
yet but it seems that topping the plants

216
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,559
right after placing them

217
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,799
seems to help the roots transfer a

218
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,479
little bit faster into the beds uh and

219
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,359
we get faster growth rates by doing that

220
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,278
as well um it's something i'm still

221
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,519
in the testing phases of but something

222
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,799
we've been noticing

223
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,078
hope you guys like what i shared with

224
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,240
you today

225
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,559
if you guys use it like it don't like it

226
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,000
