1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,339
I love this is peace of mind farming

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,559
doing a video of The Garden

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:12,120
of the

4
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:14,939
herb garden

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,600
we're gonna start off with

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:22,500
Moon Mountain Kush

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,279
this is in a 45

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,059
um

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,660
gallon pots with all these are in living

10
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,660
soil

11
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,519
this is the moon Mountain

12
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:48,058
we do a lot of

13
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,058
LSD

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,800
um training

15
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,159
it's grogging

16
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:06,899
this is the Purple Pez

17
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,899
it is in a 35 gallon

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,700
and these

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,938
all get LSD training

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,359
and a regiment of

21
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:24,059
top dress scenes usually worm castings

22
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:29,099
bokashi

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,680
lately we did recently a this is a holy

24
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,780
Rosa type tube by the way

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,840
it is in a

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,320
45 gallon

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,280
there's a little companion plant

28
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,539
we recently did a treat

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,320
um

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:54,479
a soil drench with pumpkin

31
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,219
one day and then the next day we did

32
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,780
um

33
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:00,379
micronized

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:03,960
gypsum with a whole bunch of different

35
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:06,780
bio AG stuff

36
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:10,079
this is a 100 gallon

37
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,120
and these are our autoflowers the rest

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,219
are photo periods

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:21,539
this here is pure Royal lion

40
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:25,620
same with this one right here

41
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:29,759
and this one is a Dutch queen those will

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,680
be harvested probably next week

43
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:36,959
well the rest of them

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,219
this here is the Durban runs

45
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,800
on

46
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:43,800
that is in a 35 gallon

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:55,860
and then this here is The Afghani

48
00:02:50,639 --> 00:03:00,079
currently hosted by a 45 gallon

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,080
and it's looking nice and bushy

50
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:10,518
she is very very thick

51
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,518
and she

52
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,640
it's very very

53
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,640
thick underneath

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,400
this here

55
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:26,780
is the love laughter

56
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:33,300
we didn't realize she was a photo period

57
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:35,039
so we put her in a earth box bought from

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,379
build a soil

59
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,919
great product by the way great company

60
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:41,639
and

61
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,878
um

62
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,738
we realized she was a photo period

63
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,679
about December

64
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,319
so she's been in here for quite some

65
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,500
time and it's about

66
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,500
I think seven gallons of soil

67
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,459
and it's got a hydro

68
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,139
um hydroponic system uh Down Below in

69
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,680
the reservoir

70
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:10,939
and she is doing fantastic in it and

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,939
doing amazing

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,660
this here is

73
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,280
um another Moon Mountain Kush

74
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,880
in a 35 gallon

75
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,359
and

76
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:31,259
put in the soil same time as the other

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,160
Moon mountain in the 45 gallon

78
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:38,240
this one's just taken her sweet time

79
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:42,000
and this over here

80
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,418
was one of our mothers

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,800
but it's currently being retired to

82
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,500
flower now

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,220
and one of her clones

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,680
was now becoming a um

85
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,360
the new mother and this is French

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,918
macaroon

87
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,160
let me tell you

88
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,659
this plant smells like chocolate

89
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,080
pastries

90
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:11,120
when it's in flour to me

91
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,120
and for the most part

92
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,680
they're doing really good we've got some

93
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,258
hot weather coming up so

94
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,680
that's we're currently trying to keep

95
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:25,038
them on a tight water system

96
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,699
we've got

97
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:31,019
underneath that straw is our inline drip

98
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,840
system

99
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,799
all of these plants are hooked up to a

100
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,799
timer drip system

101
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,500
and they're looking amazing

102
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,478
and yes
