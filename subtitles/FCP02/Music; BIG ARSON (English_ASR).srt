169
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,279

00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,159
he left

175
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,199
and uh yeah just ever since i kept going

176
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,439
and then back to the voicemail actually

177
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,360
um when my dad i made a rock song it's

178
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,959

179
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,080
me remember that yeah let me explain i

180
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,038
was like let me experiment with rock

181
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,598
song and [ __ ] recorded it put it out and

182
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,439
then uh my dad my dad had heard it

183
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,240
and then he left me a voice uh voice

184
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,680
message a voicemail and on that message

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,759
he's like you know that shit's tight you

186
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,000
know i'm saying you got talent he's like

187
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
just just keep going at the end yeah and

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,639
then that was basically like

189
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,720
confirmation

190
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,639
confirmation for the album because i i

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
had a i had an album planned prior

192
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,400
before that

193
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,919
um which i didn't i didn't i had a few a

194
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,719
few songs worked on it and stuff but

195
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,359
then

196
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,599
i just i just basically stuck to that

197
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,439
and then as soon as as soon as i got

198
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,680
that voicemail it was based that

199
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,519
confirmation same same message you know

200
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
i was like keep going yep so then that's

201
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,799
when you know very cool yeah from there

202
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,519
determination don't stop yeah definitely

203
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,120
so what is the recipe to keep going i

204
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,560
mean i know you mentioned a recipe in

205
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,598
there right

206
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
um

207
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,319
let's see

208
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,759
i mean

209
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,560
i mean you know in life there's like ups

210
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,520
and downs and [ __ ] you know but

211
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,680
you just

212
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,560
gotta keep gotta keep going basically

213
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
because

214
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,478
you know it's like people could you know

215
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
sometimes people try to discourage you

216
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,439
and [ __ ] you know and then you got

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,720
people there's a lot of negativity you

218
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,319
get encouraged and then you get

219
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,639
discouraged and then it's like [ __ ] you

220
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,560
know like you know i'm not not not to be

221
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,360
cocky but i'm pretty good at it so it's

222
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,120
like you know i know myself that i'm

223
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,120
able to to keep going so it's like why

224
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,280
not yep basically so that's how i see

225
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,079
yeah keep the vision bro yeah so yeah i

226
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,119
just stick to it as much as i can no

227
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,318
reasoning

228
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,759
the song

229
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,560
yeah um is that autobiographical

230
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,919
again look at the streets again um

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,280
autobiographical like you mean as far as

232
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,519
it sounds like a

233
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,918
wild like

234
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,799
an episode of going out without too much

235
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,559
forethought that one was kind of like it

236
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,639
was kind of it was i wouldn't say

237
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,038
because it connected with the pet the

238
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,958
pandemic but it was basically like just

239
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,479
like i might basically basically you say

240
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,158
that was like going out again you know

241
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
yeah yeah it's like i might go out again

242
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,759
and then when i go out you know

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,278
you know i'm saying get lit this and

244
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,958
that you know etc you know you know what

245
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,838
i'm saying but yeah basically you could

246
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,679
say that too it was just you know yep

247
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,080
like that if i go out i'm gonna go out

248
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,159
again and then the streets you know it

249
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,200
could connect too to my music too

250
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,278
you know if

251
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,879
once i go out you know i'm saying i'm uh

252
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,799
yeah i'll go out get get these

253
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,639
experiences you know just living my life

254
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,479
and then just putting it on my music

255
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,000
basically so yeah

256
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,759
i guess you could say it's odd like how

257
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you said autobiography

258
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,399
so how do you avoid the burnout factor

259
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,559
in in being a rapper and performing

260
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,958
these days

261
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,518
that's a good question um

262
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,159
burn out what do you mean by that i mean

263
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,600
well you know the road the road tends to

264
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,719
put a little pressure on you but it's

265
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,600
also encouraging right yeah um i i

266
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,000
started performing last year i'd say

267
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,759
it's been 20 yeah 2021 is when i

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,159
actually like just started performing

269
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,919
because i i had planned like for right

270
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,000
before uh covet hit the pandemic and

271
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,079
everything i was like damn i gotta start

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,799
touring but i think it gave me kind of

273
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,360
like uh i'd say a good enough amount of

274
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,278
time to actually like have songs like

275
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,120
where i have enough songs to perform

276
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,278
live right because i'd say back then it

277
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
was just so that i had yeah pandemic

278
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,759
kept you from burning out yeah so so

279
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
basically like right i just got uh i

280
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,000
found a connection with um

281
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,320
a guy a my friend friend of mine named

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,679
curfew and then he throws these shows

283
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
called no excuses shout out to no

284
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,239

285
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,600

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
him through my friend george which you

289
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,920
met george as well oh yeah yeah and then

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
um we just pulled up one day

291
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,519
basically yeah like it was just to see

292
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,680
what's up and like same day i performed

293
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,200
like on some last minute [ __ ] but

294
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,639
yeah so i've been performing like i

295
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,600
think you can remember that like about a

296
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,000
year

297
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,800
and then um yeah i mean

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,200
i just we just we did a few shows like

299
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,039
we went to texas arizona and that's the

300
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
farthest i've been to so it was pretty

301
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,519
cool it's pretty fun you know like

302
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,959
getting out there and [ __ ] yeah yeah

303
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,360
instead of just staying in like one spot

304
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,359
the whole time but um i mean it was a

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,600
little tiresome you know because we [ __ ]

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,639
we drove to texas like first we drove to

307

308
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,799
and then um when we drove to texas that

309
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,240
[ __ ] was like about

310
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,039
like 16 hours something too long

311
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,600
yeah

312
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,599
so it was the drive was tiring but once

313
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,278
you're there it's like it's a it's like

314

but for sure like from hip hop yeah um

367
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,360

raleigh uh braglio uh we worked on the

last one was jackson for my uncle and

383
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,480
that that track i had it for

384
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,079
i'd say about like a year a year about i

385
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
had it just sitting there sitting with

386
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:44,879
yeah just sitting there and then we

387
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,720
tweaked it a little bit at the at the

388
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,799
end like right before putting it out but

389
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,199
that one that's that's the one where we

390
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,198
had uh we worked on we worked on it yeah

391
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,399
you know well i like the choice of beats

392
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:55,599
yeah i appreciate it very cool there's a

393
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,480
few different producers one few

394
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,240
different

395
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,480
groovy piano

396
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,039
starts off in the low range of the piano

397
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,159
also the one 405 where you're singing is

398
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,439
very oh yeah i have 405 um on can't go

399
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,278
slow it seems like there's a few

400
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,320
meanings okay

401
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,759
um

402
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,360
well honestly

403
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,278
if i'm being honest like

404
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,440
when if when i first hear a beat that's

405
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,799
like what matters to me the most so that

406
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,560
b it's just like something about that

407
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,120
beat it's like

408
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,719
when it starts

409
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,159
so it's kind of when i first heard it it

410
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,560
was like

411
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,559
then how it starts off and it's like and

412
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,159
then it and then drops it just reminds

413
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,239
me of it kind of reminded me of like a

414
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,159
like a car taking off and getting ready

415
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,560
to take off you know yeah yeah so and

416
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,639
then and then i'd say uh the meaning as

417
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,599
well is it goes with the concept of the

418
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,360
album

419
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,040
most of the songs on there it just kind

420
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,039
of connected some some of them i meant

421
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,319
to meant to connect yeah and others that

422
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,799
kind of just you know connect with the

423
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,160
message of keep going but you know when

424
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,240
when you're when you're going on your

425
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,159
path you know you can't go slow and you

426
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,480
can't can't slow down yeah you know what

427
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,039
i'm saying so you just gotta just gotta

428
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,720
take take off fast yeah keep the pace

429
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,838
yeah you gotta you can't go slow you

430
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
know what i'm saying and your life is

431
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
kind of like a race

432
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,039
especially with this [ __ ] you feel me

433
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,320
so

434
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,559
um

435
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,480
my favorite song on the album is 405

436
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,439
because because of the chorus where

437
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,879
you're actually singing yeah um what

438
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,720
about more singing you ever thought

439
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,799
about who inspired you to do the singing

440
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,800
and are you going to do more

441
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,078
uh say inspir well obviously like i said

442
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,758
i'd say drake

443
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,838
drake is a big inspiration i'd say for a

444
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,519
lot of like a lot of artists of today

445
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,199
you know because he started not not that

446
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,120
he started that

447
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,599
right before him it was kanye and then

448
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,720
right after uh kanye started with the he

449
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,720
dropped the album called 808s and

450
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,079
heartbreaks and then he switched it up

451
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,879
because i remember when that album came

452
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,159
out

453
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,919
like uh my uncles my uncle my dad they

454
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,078
especially my dad he loves kanye you

455
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,639
know he's always like kanye's [ __ ]

456
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,479
and then uh with that album he switched

457
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,440
it up with like more scene scene rap

458
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,800
yeah yeah and that was like 2007 2008

459
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,560
and then you know they kind of weren't

460
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,919
like like [ __ ] with the album too

461
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,000
much you know because it's like

462
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,439
different from just just hip-hop hip-hop

463
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,519
yeah and then he and then he switched it

464
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,120
up with like uh singing a little bit you

465
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,519
know then right after him

466
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,440
you know drake kind of kept that going

467
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,198
with the singing and now nowadays if you

468
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,880

620
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,759

tiger oh so cool yeah yeah

630
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,240
yeah you check that out but uh yeah with

631
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,480
that one as soon as i started writing

632
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,400
and i just heard her he like i said to

633
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,640
the beat the beat is what

634
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,798
it's where i kind of start off with the

635
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,880
pro the writing process and everything

636
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,400
and i just heard the beat and like you

637
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,159
know just kind of like i can't really

638
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,880
explain it with you without me like

639
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,280
singing it and [ __ ] but i understand

640
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,120
i just got maybe sometimes too it's like

641
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,798
maybe i mumble something and then i kind

642
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,359
of but it then it all connects with the

643
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,519
the words eventually but uh without the

644
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,599
blanks yeah with that one too

645
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,400
i don't know if i had the

646
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,678
the the idea for the i the album yet

647
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,120
like i was for sure gonna call it

648
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,038
keyboard it fits in the theme yeah but

649
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,599
it all just kind of yeah it all kind of

650
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,359
kind of keeps going and then um yeah i

651
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,399
just started right and started writing

652
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,079
it and then

653
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,480
i saved it and then we recorded it what

654
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,000
like about four or five months ago but

655
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880

you know i'm close like every time i i

659

come up with something like it could be

660
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,000
even uh it could feel like a little

661
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,279
discouraging or like give me anxiety

662
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,359
like because every time it feels like

663
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,359
i'm closer and it's like oh i'm supposed

664
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,959
to be happier and then it's like you

665

671
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,679
that one i guess behind that one yeah

672
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,400
that's just funny it's a little

673
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,960
frustrating but it feels good and then

674
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,280

756
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,960
let you shine cause you showed me i was

757
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:39,519
gifted and one of a kind also lifted

758
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,159
transcendent now it swings as we've been

759
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,480
given you was a blessing god had gifted

760
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,720
the life you live was like [ __ ] from a

761
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,798
movie scripting but i can't get to the

762
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,759
script that the [ __ ] you seen as a kid

763
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:54,400
was just way too twisted it threw a lot

764
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,558
a kid in and out of prison but still

765
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,720
through all that you made a change but

766
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,519
to the devil he was trying to keep you

767
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,120
chained but you kept pushing anyway made

768
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,960
it through the struggle made it through

769
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,278
the rain through the pain

770
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,000
even through the sadness always smile on

771
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,480
your face and when i think about you

772
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,558
take a smile off my face cause then i'm

773
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,038
sad cause i will never see you face to

774
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,599
face but then i hear a voice from god

775
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,558
saying you in a better place so then i

776
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,639
smile and at you in a safer place you

777
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,058
