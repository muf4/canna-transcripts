[Music]

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,800
yo everyone I'm Pax of the future and

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,480
we're here in OG is my Oxygen's Glass

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,960
Studio what's up gang and I just feel

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,560
super lucky cuz you are indulging me in

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,118
an idea that I've wanted to explore for

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,239
a while which is like smoking the entire

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,320
drop and I think that a lot of people

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,959
hit me from a viiew perspective and

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,640
asked about the drops in total in Brands

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,000
more than they talk about any individual

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,679
jars I think people are sort of

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,439
yeah more of a complete picture and this

14
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:36,200
is a way for us to show it and what

15
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,640
better way to start off than candido

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,280
craft absolutely so we have rolled up

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,239
two joints here of the candido craft

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,320
rainbow belts and blueberry z um

19
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,320
included in this video will be some

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,520
footage and time lapse of the flower as

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,119
well as the rollup uh so you can see

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,920
what the process was like breaking the

23
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,358
flow down and uh yeah we're excited to

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,198
smoke these with y'all I think we're

25
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,120
super smoked so candido rainbow belts is

26
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,000
something they've had for a while have

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,438
gained some popularity with but also the

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,519
Z it's a rainbow belts either 2.0 or

29
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,559
three 3.0 so it's the rainbow belts back

30
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,359
onto the moonbow but it definitely has

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,600
really strong zurs we crushed a half oun

32
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,719
of this already uh the blueberry Z was a

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,478
little bit more limited so it's going to

34
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,039
be both of our first time smoking it

35
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:25,280
[ __ ] yeah today but like historically

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,118
candido has for me been one of the top

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,359
five Growers uh since I first tried

38
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,879
their stuff a little bit over a year and

39
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,840
a half ago uh uh and it was like the

40
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,640
Moonglow at that point or maybe it was

41
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,040
called Moon D there was the Skittles uh

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,478
there was also rainbow belts and it was

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,399
all phenomenal I think that there was a

44
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,239
really strong zurp through line

45
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:46,960
incredibly clean organic burn and and

46
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,959
more potency than I get from an average

47
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,118
or commercially grown Skittles they also

48
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,039
made waves with some like funkier

49
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:56,118
strains I think that they had a

50
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,520
shoreline skunk that people really loved

51
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,118
there was an OG that people really cared

52
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,438
about and I think limited amounts that

53
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,000
came out right now uh with this current

54
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:06,000
drop but they're really focusing on

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,520
these flavors which is why I'm stoked to

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,719
get into both of them um and yeah you

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,800
rolled them up why don't we start with

58
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,000
the blueberry Z because we haven't tried

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,400
that one yet blueberry Z and rainbow

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,280
belt this batch both are super super

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,840
resinous the trim is um the trim I would

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,280
say is more of an old school trim

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,800
there's Leaf left over but it's coated

64
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,318
in sugary triom it's very very sticky um

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,080
you know I can't quite show you guys how

66
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,479
sticky it is but believe me this has

67
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,120
definitely been one of the tougher ones

68
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,759
to roll up you were saying with some of

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,640
the stickiest weed you've ever yeah this

70
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,959
is some of the stickiest weed I've ever

71
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,399
rolled crazy which did you think was

72
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,878
stickier as you were rolling them I

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,599
think the blueberry Z was stickier cool

74
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,959
yeah definitely interesting and say

75
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:59,079
blueberry Z is from turog uh it was I

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,640
think an emerald Cup 2022 clone release

77
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,360
uh it says that it's blueberry cross to

78
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:06,598
Z3 off the dryp it almost tastes like

79
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,599
raspberries and cream like a raspberry

80
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,158
and cream yogurt or ice cream situation

81
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,359
it's really Berry forward acidic and

82
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,639
sweet but also super almost milky is

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,440
that what you're getting yeah it's like

84
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,479
Froot Loops almost uh there's the kind

85
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,439
of sweetness there's the milkiness um

86
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,679
there's definitely definitely a lot of

87
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,120
Froot Loops flavor when I smelled it

88
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,080
first thing opening the jar my initial

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,640
reaction and the first thing I said was

90
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,760
that it smelled like fro Loops which is

91
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,119
hilarious well I mean we're it's August

92
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,518
we're in a glass

93
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,039
studio when we opened the jar the room

94
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,360
[ __ ] we yeah and it really smelled

95
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,479
pretty incredible with the blueberries

96
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,159
even more than the rainbow bels I'd say

97
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,079
which is why I agree yeah I hope it just

98
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,280
doesn't overpower our P but I'm also

99
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,200
really excited the homie cushies did

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,479
this these jars um and he's

101
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,878
been really making me jealous as he

102
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,479
smoked through this I've been sitting on

103
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:02,158
the jars for a couple week want to

104
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,518
you to find a way to make good content

105
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,639
with them but it feels like people have

106
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,719
really enjoyed enjoyed this drop I've

107
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,438
had big

108
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,909
fomo shout out to the homie kushies

109
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:18,000
talented graphic designer for sure the

110
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:22,040
[Music]

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,478
homie off how's it going it's nice it's

112
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,360
lighting up nice the I haven't quite

113
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,959
gotten the flavor yet completely

114
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,439
but when you light a joint sometimes

115
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:37,359
that can be uh part of the

116
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,918
experience so sometimes when you first

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,240
light a joint it can be hard to get the

118
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,159
initial flavor until you've let the

119
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,879
Cherry cool down from the ignition and I

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
feel like yeah it makes sense you're as

121
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,639
the smoke is passing through the joint

122
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,159
the hotter the temperature the more

123
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,478
vaporization will'll be of the volatile

124
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,320
turpins and the less you'll really get

125
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,758
to experience that and so we're huge

126
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,079
Advocates of letting the Cherry cool

127
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,160
down I know a lot of like the proper dos

128
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,879
guys talk about that all the time

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,120
um and I think there really is something

130
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,159
to it this is cool the flavor is pretty

131
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,120
true to the smell after letting it chill

132
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,520
and taking a few more drags I'm

133
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,600
definitely getting a lot of that Froot

134
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:17,159
Loops flavor I described um it has that

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,080
milky creaminess um it just you know I I

136
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,960
was never much of a super sugar cereal

137
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,959
Advocate but the flavor is absolutely

138
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,839
reminiscent of Froot Loops straight up

139
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,120
that's

140
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:32,519
awesome yeah it's uh it's transferring

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,639
pretty well on the first poles of the

142
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:38,079
joint after letting it cool off from the

143
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,079
ignition I'm definitely getting

144
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:45,439
that what do you

145
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,600
think I mean that's really good there's

146
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,120
a really defined Berry

147
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,720
flavor it almost tastes like an underp

148
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,439
strawberry yeah there isn't as much of

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
the

150
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,038
creaminess that I noted in the aroma and

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
the dry pole it's

152
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:02,199
more almost just like like an amplified

153
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,280
and more modern version of old school

154
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,879
perss like if you told me that this was

155
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,239
a really grape forward grape c f know

156
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,319
I'd believe

157
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,000
it I feel which is all to say that it's

158
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,400
it's really delicious smoke I've also

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,038
heard that this one is really so I'm

160
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,120
looking forward to that awesome yeah

161
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,478
this one uh I mean it tastes pretty true

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,240
to the smell so far it's nice when goes

163
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:27,758
line up so you roll a really tight joint

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,960
filterless and I think that that also

165
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,080
helps with cherry temperature like as

166
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,079
I'm drawing I'm really

167
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,038
getting I don't know it just tastes

168
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,839
purple to me is the best way I can

169
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:42,918
explain and it's super delicious um I

170
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,159
wonder if more of that sort of Z3 Hindu

171
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:46,120
tones would come through if it was

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,639
combusting a little bit hotter

173
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,439
interesting I think that's definitely a

174
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,478
good experiment we can try with our next

175
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:56,120
one um yeah I'm excited to try it after

176
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:58,439
the uh the first Roto I know I'm hogging

177
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,959
it but there it's like the zotes are

178
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,319
more reminiscent a blue Zushi yeah than

179
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,878
they are straight Skittles I don't know

180
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,080
how to explain that it has that latent

181
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:10,240
funk in the background which the purple

182
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:12,478
tones accentuate really nicely this is

183
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,680
really really delicious smoke the the

184
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:19,439
texture is a little bit not to reuse a

185
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,560
word but volatile it isn't harsh but

186
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,959
it's similar to the experience of

187
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,879
smoking really really turpy hash where

188
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:29,318
it leaves an effect on the throat yeah

189
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,120
yeah you can definitely feel the turs

190
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,960
when when they're there

191
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,840
um yeah I think

192
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:41,799
um I think the way the way this is

193
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:43,119
rolled definitely complement it um we're

194
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,158
about to find out how the flavor is

195
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,399
doing after a few more

196
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,158
polls I think you'll enjoy it I'm really

197
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,079
enjoying

198
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:54,360
it yeah it is nice and

199
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,279
actually getting back to this after you

200
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,800
smoked it I'm getting more of the purple

201
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:03,119
and more of the funk um my first VI hits

202
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,680
were way more uh kind of Fruit Loops

203
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,800
forward and now it's starting to relax

204
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,918
into the funky notes the older purpley

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,840
notes uh things I like it reminds me of

206
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,758
the mixed berry Fruit by the Foot I

207
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,878
think that's why it's not purple in like

208
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,280
a grape way it's purple and like a red

209
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,319
blue swirl way totally if that makes any

210
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,598
sense exct totally it's delicious though

211
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,080
it's really very good and I think on par

212
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,560
with the quality that I'd expect from

213
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,918
candido yeah rolling this up you do have

214
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,360
to be careful there's a lot of stray

215
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:40,000
leaf and material that you'll want to

216
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,000
pull out um you know I believe if you

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,559
want your experience to be more flavor

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
forward you have to remove stems you

219
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,759
have to remove leaf and anything that is

220
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,839
not you know something that you think

221
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:54,759
you'd want to smoke to get flavor um for

222
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,120
this in particular you have to be extra

223
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:01,480
vigilant with that it didn't seem like

224
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:04,000
there was any like water Leaf material

225
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,839
on the flower um it seemed like a lot of

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,958
Sugar Leaf and it you know probably was

227
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,519
left there

228
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,359
intentionally uh it did a good job of

229
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,000
preserving the tricomes for sure as I

230
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,600
said when I was rolling it up it was

231
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,399
incredibly sticky the flavor was you

232
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,079
know pretty true to The Taste we're

233
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,600
getting as well so the preservation

234
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:25,759
through that method definitely

235
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,720
works but you know

236
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:33,240
you as as like a grower or a producer

237
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,240
anyone who's you know going from A to B

238
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,879
A being you with the flower B being the

239
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,000
person smoking it it's important to

240
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,399
consider whether or not your customer

241
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,839
knows to remove that or if they even

242
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,278
want to um certainly that will affect

243
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,279
the

244
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,519
experience and I think it's interesting

245
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,919
because this is so incredibly turpy and

246
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,639
enjoyable to smoke and I know that the

247
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:58,078
Harvest was probably upwards of 45 days

248
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,240
ago and

249
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,639
it's why ly flavorful which is sometimes

250
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,000
something that does degrade over time

251
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,519
and very quickly with with certain

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,320
commercial products final thoughts on

253
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,959
the blueberry Z is that this is

254
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,480
really what I'd expect from candido I

255
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,119
think that once you do break down the

256
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,680
Plant matter in a way that that swirl

257
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,480
and you've removed all the material that

258
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,519
will simply burn too hot and make it not

259
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,440
a pleasant

260
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,679
joint you get some of the finest weed on

261
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,200
Earth I think that it's burning really

262
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,399
nicely certainly not in an artificial B

263
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,600
white way but it certainly is clean and

264
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,278
there's no none of that background sort

265
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,639
of carbony cor of you know other flavors

266
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:42,320
that you get when you sort of have a

267
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:45,680
darker more uh rustic Ash the flavor is

268
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,879
really dead on for the aroma it's super

269
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,239
loud it's a berry turp and it's a good

270
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:52,360
interesting modern turp and then on top

271
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,720
of it all it's like potent I feel

272
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,600
sillier yeah toally before we started

273
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,240
totally totally um you know we were sort

274
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,560
of more familiar with the

275
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,320
with the rainbow belts and I think we

276
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,319
can almost just say off the bat we don't

277
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,160
enjoy the rainbow belts as much we we'll

278
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,399
get to do it and offer our thoughts but

279
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,278
to give an honest reflection of or just

280
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,559
like an honest reaction to this this is

281
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,958
the far away the superior of the do this

282
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:20,319
mhm yeah definitely I think I like this

283
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:22,319
blueberry Z more than I like the rainbow

284
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,480
belts that being said the rainbow belts

285
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,040
is good and we'll spark it up and let

286
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,039
you know what we

287
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,680
think actually do you want to dry pull

288
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:35,958
it yeah I'll do that and let youjo this

289
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,439
a little off the dry pull just uh off

290
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,518
that first dry pull right there I was

291
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,519
getting more old school funky flavors

292
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,519
than I was straight Z or straight belts

293
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,078
as I know it yeah I don't think this has

294
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,720
been my experience in the past but I'm

295
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,399
getting straight lemon heads off the dry

296
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,320
pole which is fun to be able to really

297
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,200
notice that but it's this sharp citric

298
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,560
acid with a little bit of a yellow

299
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,800
coloring to it

300
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,119
let's trade

301
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,359
back yeah spark that I think you know

302
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
we'll

303
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:16,120
enjoy yeah hitting that

304
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:19,480
again the old school flavor is more moth

305
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,759
B more moth B not in a bad way more like

306
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,278
in the perfume of the

307
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,480
mothball and that lemon is there it does

308
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:31,159
have that tarte citric

309
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,839
note they're definitely is a funk to the

310
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:36,120
way that they select in particular their

311
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:39,040
work from archive the Dosey even though

312
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,519
it's so far back um but on both sides

313
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,399
with the rainbow belts and the moonbo is

314
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,839
a really Dynamic almost nutty cush and I

315
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:51,519
think they candido in particular selects

316
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,000
fenos of belts that are show more of

317
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,720
that cushy nutty range as opposed to

318
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,240
that straight Z that was straight

319
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,360
hazelnut on the first puff which is

320
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,360
interesting because right after con uh

321
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,159
combustion as you light the joint you

322
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,519
don't typically get a ton of

323
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:10,480
flavor yeah it is leaning kind of like

324
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,039
a I don't know what you would call it

325
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,360
like it's like a rich nut or like a

326
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:19,039
fatty nut like a hazelnut or a kind of

327
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,039
chestnut

328
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,919
almost and now the kind the lemony

329
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:31,719
Citrus is starting to come through but I

330
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:33,719
definitely think there's a uh Chestnut

331
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,360
undertones it's interesting we spent

332
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,759
some time with a breeder who wants

333
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,278
really advocated for the rainbow belts

334
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,759
because he felt it had more of a defined

335
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:47,559
lemon lime Citrus tone than Skittles

336
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,838
itself I think that I really like that

337
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,518
grapefruit

338
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,000
cardamom just candy element of the

339
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,120
original Skittles cut but it's

340
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,839
interesting that lemon is something

341
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,600
that's more available in belts it's cool

342
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,240
that

343
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,519
folks are finding that totally yeah off

344
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,519
the first pull of that belt it's

345
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,560
definitely lemon definitely chestnuts or

346
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,199
something

347
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,879
funky oh I you know there's kind of yeah

348
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,519
it's

349
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,000
like for sure it's creamy at first but

350
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,159
then it develops into the kind of nutty

351
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,720
chest nutty type of thing yeah it's like

352
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,838
macadamia nut or something fatty excuse

353
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,959
the the words I'm going to describe this

354
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:35,079
with but it's like a fatty

355
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:36,719
nut that's so interesting and moth B too

356
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:38,638
I think I didn't get mothball in the dry

357
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,680
pole but I very much get in the Smoke

358
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,639
it's interesting right and I don't know

359
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,519
that it's a note that I picked up on

360
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,039
with previous ons I think the citus had

361
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,839
really stood out to me um but I also

362
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,480
think people maybe hadn't been breaking

363
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,240
it down as meticulously as you just did

364
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,278
I'm enjoying this more than my previous

365
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,600
experiences with it though it is and I

366
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:01,958
think being honest is a big part of what

367
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,079
we try to do here this one does irritate

368
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:07,000
my throat uh and sometimes really turkey

369
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:10,198
strands will do that certainly really

370
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,759
turkey hash will yeah it's why I

371
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,278
sometimes steer clear at Fresh fress

372
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,278
particularly when it's a citrus Lon in

373
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:20,198
uh dominant St mhm yeah I can give you

374
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,679
the Wasabi effect light your nose

375
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:24,399
up but there's less of this right now

376
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,039
and maybe it was just also the extended

377
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,519
jar care yeah than than previously I

378
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,000
think that I would have really leaned

379
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,759
into that comment based on my first jar

380
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
yeah but this is Pleasant smoke yeah

381
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,278
totally yeah I'm excited to try that one

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,399
again I think

383
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:44,480
um it's interesting that there's latent

384
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,480
uh you know like pack said from the

385
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,120
Dosey or something like that there's a

386
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,278
lot of latent Funk to be found in this

387
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,600
genetic yeah I want to hand this back to

388
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:58,120
you but on the exhale that time there

389
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,560
was a real sort of jet fuel cushiness

390
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,759
and it was not present on the inhale but

391
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,239
it was that

392
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,240
expansive almost like

393
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,120
sasparilla I mean really and I should

394
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,078
just say the thing that I'm thinking it

395
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,639
has that almost like a cola gummy on the

396
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:18,479
exhale and I associate that with some of

397
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,120
the darkest and strongest cochet when

398
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,120
sort of paired with a bit of fuel

399
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,078
mhm yeah definitely getting the Cola

400
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,720
gummy

401
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:34,318
it's interesting because that almost

402
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,360
fits as a overarching descriptor for all

403
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:38,360
the things we described at first

404
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:47,359
because the nuttiness SL SAS Barilla

405
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,959
slash um more deep kind of robust notes

406
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,480
plus the Light Citrus that you actually

407
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:54,159
weirdly enough get if you fight into a

408
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,959
colig gumy the first taste you get is

409
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:59,278
the Citrus citric acid and then

410
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,838
immediately it devolves into that Cola

411
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,720
sasparilla flavor and there's not much

412
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,798
Citrus left I feel like uh I feel like

413
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,199
the experience is very similar with

414
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,038
this and so I'm excited to be focusing

415
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,720
on the rainbow belts but I will say

416
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:16,160
around halfway through the joint this

417
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,360
has lost a little bit of flavor yeah um

418
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,839
I'm still really enjoying it but a lot

419
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:26,798
of the brighter qualities and the

420
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:28,639
sharper richer sort of buried toes have

421
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,119
have muted and it now is smoking kind of

422
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,679
more like almost what I associate is

423
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:37,599
like an old school blueberry that kind

424
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,919
of it's not tiny but

425
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,798
it's it's quote that same breeder kind

426
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,880
of fruit of the forest

427
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,639
mhm yeah I'm really leaning into the

428
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,120
Cola gummy on this

429
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,480
one I think and like pack said it's a

430
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,678
very distinctly different experience

431
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,519
than the other joints we've smoked

432
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,440
through this jar um maybe we've smoked

433
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:03,079
one or two per week of these for the

434
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,880
last two weeks it's been a rotation yeah

435
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:07,960
totally and the experience was

436
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,600
definitely different you know it's funny

437
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,079
the only thing I can think right now is

438
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,599
that this is their their jar of rainbow

439
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,639
belts in particular and it is Rainbow

440
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,480
belts 3.0 which is backr from

441
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,280
moono um being

442
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,919
said he's less Z than their moonbo

443
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,558
selection and shows the range of

444
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,799
variation of poly hybrids and people

445
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,918
sort of assume based on these crosses

446
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,279
they're going to know what the dirt

447
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,600
profile is but there's so many potential

448
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:37,960
recessive combinations that I do think

449
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,319
candido has a moonbow that leans more

450
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,000
Skittles than their belts and their

451
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:45,200
belts is kind of almost something

452
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,960
entirely different yeah seems like

453
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,679
it wow this is still nice but the flavor

454
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,919
has changed nothing you know makes me

455
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,559
want to nothing that makes me want to

456
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:59,720
put it down or anything it's

457
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:01,319
um just interesting always to

458
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,319
kind of think about how your flavor is

459
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,798
going to change throughout your

460
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,839
joint so this is

461
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:10,639
definitely funky yeah look super funky

462
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,399
it's a little bit peppery but in a

463
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,880
pleasant way not in override Skittles

464
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,640
way there's a lot of that cardamon

465
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,679
there's not as much Citrus as I had

466
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,280
experienced when it was fresher so I

467
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,720
think that really is worth noting that

468
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,599
you know those lion and TPS are are

469
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,558
maybe the most volatile um totally

470
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,038
whatever else sort ofri to those Citrus

471
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:34,480
tones and that it kind of with a bit of

472
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,319
a jar here has tapered off I also think

473
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,759
it's gotten smoother I'm I'm enjoying

474
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,038
smoking it mhm more than I had

475
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,480
previously which isn't to say that we

476
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:43,158
didn't enjoy it a bunch I it was in

477
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,919
rotation all the time but it was always

478
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,559
like a o my throat's going to got a

479
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,320
little bit scratchy and some of that's

480
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:52,119
fallen off too it's

481
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,678
definitely marketly stronger than the

482
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:56,519
blueberries and I think that every time

483
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,600
that we smoked this previously it

484
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:01,279
absolutely throttled me and now that

485
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,599
it's been in rotation for about 2

486
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,720
seconds the blueberry Z was very

487
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,558
pleasant it was certainly potent it got

488
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,558
the job done but this one is Stupify

489
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:14,839
yeah absolutely and while I don't like

490
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:18,038
the flavor or the combustion really as

491
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:20,439
much the effects are out of this world

492
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:22,960
yeah it's ridiculously strong I mean the

493
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,640
blueberry Z was euphoric when we first

494
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,558
hit it and then we lit this joint up and

495
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,840
immediately I got ridiculously stoned

496
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:33,918
it's way heavier I think it has little

497
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:35,399
bits of like you know confusion and bits

498
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,640
of I don't know just everything feeles a

499
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,159
little bit slower totally it's

500
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,400
stonier it's it's less

501
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:47,159
euphoric totally um and Different

502
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,159
Strokes I think that by and large my

503
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:50,280
opinion of can hasn't really changed

504
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,400
it's the kind of thing that when it's

505
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,359
available I'm always going to smoke I'm

506
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,759
eager to try their other Cults of ours

507
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:59,158
and I don't know if rainbow belts this

508
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,759
particular feno

509
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,039
is the kind of thing that I'd gravitate

510
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,400
towards again and again MH but I do

511
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:05,440
think every time the blueberry is

512
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,640
available it's the kind of thing I'm

513
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,159
going to grab because it's definitely

514
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,159
potent enough the flavor is exceptional

515
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,720
it's grown with the utmost Care by

516
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,720
people or my senses that they are real

517
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,079
bastions

518
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
and you know part of the Legacy that

519
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,960
brought us to this moment and the sort

520
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
of thing that we need to preserve if we

521
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,000
don't want to be smoking corporate

522
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,400
commercial mids for the rest of our life

523
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,679
do that

524
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,278
