5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,760
hey everybody Chad Westport here and we

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,320
are on day 28 of the Auto Park Row diary

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,939
everything is looking good made a couple

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,340
of changes this week a little

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,340
defoliation I also turned off the

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,620
autopod system so I could top feed some

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,899
dry amendments I'll cover that in a

12
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,000
second but let's go in and take a closer

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,558
look at some of the plants all right so

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
here we are we're looking at Kool-Aid

15
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,058
man and as you can see I added a little

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,579
bit of trellis here just to support the

17
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:54,000
growing buds uh this is a big bushy

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,759
plant all in that seven gallon pot so

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,738
you know what uh it needed a little bit

20
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:02,218
support everything else in the tent was

21
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:05,579
good so you know I love this little uh

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,560
deer fence it's rubber coated steel and

23
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,560
I just hang everything with twist ties

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,900
off the light off there and then

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,060
actually over here I got a yo-yo but

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,880
again these are just you know simple

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,740
little growted grow hacks I don't need a

28
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,438
full scrog net but this gets the job

29
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,759
done but anyways let's take a look at it

30
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,819
it is

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,459
growing pretty nice you know again day

32
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,618
28. uh let's see if we can get a

33
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,419
close-up of some trichome coverage on it

34
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,959
let me get that

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,939
yeah it's getting pretty good so stoked

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,118
that's the Kool-Aid man again this one

37
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,699
is from bee Leaf cannabis in the back

38
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,319
here we've got the Twin Peaks which as

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,540
you can tell I definitely heavily

40
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,298
defoliated distance last week you

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,560
actually see the bud sites now uh and

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,060
there's a whole bunch of them and

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,740
they're starting to form up pretty nice

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,259
starting to form up like little golf

45
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:02,399
balls down there I'm digging that this

46
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,438
Twin Peaks bitching uh yeah so that's

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,420
how that one's going right now

48
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,519
and then we got our Westport grape

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,020
juices this is the one in the back and

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,900
as you can see you know it's starting to

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,300
build it's colas uh it's starting to put

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,980
on some trichome coverage and you know

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,200
as the name implies it's getting a

54
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:22,139
little bit of purple as well so here's

55
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,959
the one in the front we got two of those

56
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:28,559
in here so the West Court Westport grape

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,319

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,680

59
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:38,219
looking like right now again day 28 a

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,099
flower for all of these ladies and they

61
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:43,739
are in the Soho living soil which is a

62
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:46,018
water only soil but one of the changes I

63
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,239
made this week is I actually turned off

64
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,980
the auto parts because I'm going to top

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,719
dress in with my kiss organic nutrients

66
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:57,479
so this one I actually already watered

67
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,878
it in uh that's just a seven gallon but

68
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,719
these are the auto pots here I've added

69
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:06,179
