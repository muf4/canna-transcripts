1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:07,080
hey another uh field notes from our

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,240
African sativas everything's getting

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,599
charging and lots of flowers going on

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,019
but this one is one of my favorites it's

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:20,179
just so elegant and African and long

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:23,939
leaves uh so this is a Congo Congolese

7
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:27,960
uh Point Noir which I'm guessing means

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,460
Black Point uh so this is one of the

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,579
Congolese we're growing we're also

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,558
growing a Congolese red stem but this

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,219
one and the seeds were really tough to

12
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:41,459
germinate so I only have one female

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,539
going uh right now we had two other

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:49,820
males that we said bye to but anyway

15
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:52,500
very cool structure these long elegant

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,738
leaves and when it the Wind Blows the

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,159
whole plant just really dances and it's

18
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:01,500
just a gorgeous so such a unique

19
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,959
beautiful plant

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,659
and it it actually kind of

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,460
Whispers as it's blowing in the leaves

22
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,240
it makes this cool little Whispering

23
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:15,478
noise so anyway uh but this probably has

24
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:18,239
uh it's October 23rd today I would say

25
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,859
this has three to four weeks to go so

26
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,798
we're looking

27
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,659
um probably Thanksgiving oh there's a

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,380
I've got a lot of ladybugs right now

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,900
helping us beat back the aphid so uh I

30
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,780
don't every once while I'll see an aphid

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,500
but the ladybugs are really keeping them

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,099
in check and super stoked that we have

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,659
native uh predatory insects taking

34
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:47,399
protecting our plants very cool anyway

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:50,000
this is congo.nar or Black Point

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,000
yay
