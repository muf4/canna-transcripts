00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:11,019
[Music]

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:21,300
all right

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:21,299
[Music]

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,500
things are looking good here under the

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,320
spider farmer SE 5000 light 480 Watts

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,100
fits the footprint of my 4x4 perfectly

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,899
so I like that light not too much not

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,239
too little it's kind of the sweet spot

9
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,179
where a lot of the home cultivation is

10
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:45,299
so as you can see the nakatomi plazas

11
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:48,359
are growing great the sohub living soil

12
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:51,179
is doing its job I did one top dressing

13
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,460
couple weeks ago of the kiss Organics

14
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:56,698
nutrient pack other than that I've been

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,859
giving these just straight up water and

16
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,198
they're in three gallon pots which is

17
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,539
smaller than the size they recommend but

18
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,719
you know what I like to push it because

19
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,060
I want to find where that line is

20
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,739
I've had great success with the soil so

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,680
I'm not really that surprised but things

22
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,839
are looking great and again on Day 36

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,220
I'm a day late on the week update with

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,079
Day 36 on a pretty much a 60 well 55 to

25
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,379
65 day strain

26
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,759
yeah money so doing good but let's go in

27
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,739
and take a closer look at these things

28
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,079
all right kind of the general aerial

29
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,539
shot as we slide in here now I didn't do

30
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,099
any uh like topping or anything on these

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,740
so as you can see they're going to be

32
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:42,059
growing you know nice tall Cola there

33
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:44,099
nice Taco uh tall Cola Cola Cola Cola

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,780
um but you know another thing that I do

35
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,839
appreciate about these is they are

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,599
putting off you know like the the side

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,659
buds little colas

38
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,118
you know the little colas boom boom in

39
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,880
the back and I got the other one here

40
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,578
they're actually good size you know

41
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,379
they're not little buds even though I

42
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,298
didn't do anything to control the apical

43
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:10,079
dominance on these I just let them grow

44
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,780
as they wanted to but this is kind of

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,440
how they're looking right now again this

46
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,239
is Day 36 we go up here you can see you

47
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,598
know starting to put on some color there

48
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,000
I think that looks pretty nice and yeah

49
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,500
I didn't defoliate after I said I was

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,900
going to defoliate a whole bunch of

51
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,560
times but you know what that's okay it's

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,260
day 44 on the nakatomi Plaza grow we are

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,000
getting close to the end a couple of

54
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,598
them are showing signs they're going to

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,639
be done really soon uh there's one and a

56
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,518
half there we'll just call it two that

57
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,738
look like they may go a week longer but

58
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,599
let's go in and take a look at them all

59
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,000
right so we had three of the same height

60
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,219
and three with the same bud structure

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,759
they're also similar but again just

62
00:02:53,219 --> 00:03:00,419
trying to group them into categories

63
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:03,598
this one I did not defoliate but the one

64
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:06,479
to on the right side of the tent was

65
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:10,139
actually same height same shape same

66
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:12,719
everything except I defoliated it so

67
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,279
we'll kind of see if you know all of a

68
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,219
sudden the defoliated one has much

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,439
larger smaller Buds versus the one with

70
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,060
the least still on it so that's just

71
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,060
kind of a fun little experiment that I'm

72
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,699
doing on this grow out the one thing I

73
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,060
will say is this one still has a lot

74
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:33,318
more white pistols stigma is actually a

75
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,300
lot more white stigmas on it compared to

76
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:38,818
this one that I defoliated now is that

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,980
related or was it just maybe because I

78
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,199
bumped some of them and you know that

79
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,899
caused them to mature early we'll find

80
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,179
out but those are these two nakatomi

81
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,239
plazas and then we have this one in the

82
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,640
center which was one of the two taller

83
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,158
ones but it actually shares the same bud

84
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,559
structure as the other two shorter ones

85
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,739
I just showed you but this one I also

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,900
defoliated just uh wanted to create a

87
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,819
little more airflow around it again you

88
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,519
know it's like I shaved the legs on it

89
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:11,878
but the side branches are pretty compact

90
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,180
the bud set is pretty tight on there so

91
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:17,159
that was the other

92
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,439
nakatomi Plaza in here so here's that

93
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,199
nakatomi Plaza in back that you know

94
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,060
what I mean it really reminds me of the

95
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,819
Westport grape juice that's what this

96
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,000
thing looks like to me uh you know it's

97
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,879
just the color it's got decent you know

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,860
buds on the sides just all over the

99
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,659
place oh I can't see because the

100
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,639
camera's so freaking or the light's so

101
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,199
bright on the back of the camera I'm

102
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,060
just gonna move it around and then

103
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,460
there's this one in the back which is

104
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,339
just [ __ ] doinking up man this thing

105
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:51,239
is just putting on

106
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:54,079
powerful freaking colas on every Branch

107
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,000
tip you can see there's a little bit of

108
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,959
nutrient issues with the lease but you

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,899
know what it seems to be doing just fine

110
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:07,138
uh big old donkey Cola here

111
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:09,239
I mean do I need to like zoom out to get

112
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,900
it all shoot

113
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,300
yeah so that's the nakatomi plaza in the

114
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,779
back growing some nice

115
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:22,079
fatty buds wherever you look

116
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:25,679
and that one the smell is pretty damn

117
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:29,399
pungent it is day 51 of flower on the

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,340
nakatomi Plaza so nakatomi Plaza water

119
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,439
only and a 480 watt light this is what

120
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,819
we're looking at on day 51. before we

121
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,500
really start looking at this plant I

122
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,719
just want to go down and show you that

123
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,620
you know there is a little bit of yellow

124
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,500
on the lower lease the senesis that when

125
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,959
you're you know nine ten days away from

126
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,120
Harvest you would kind of expect so even

127
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,519
in this sohum soil and the three gallon

128
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,918
containers you will get some senescence

129
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,079
which is good that's what we want and

130
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,258
you can see that back there on the other

131
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,300
plant as well some of the lower losing

132
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,060
its colors sending it upwards but yeah

133
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,600
so some natural senescence even in this

134
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,560
organic soil which is good but again the

135
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,960
tops are doing just fine all right so

136
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,280
we're checking out the plant in the left

137
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,159
front

138
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,318
putting on some you know decent buds all

139
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,860
over this one is probably going to go

140
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,919
the longest this one might go 63 days or

141
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,900
so uh it's got the most white pistols

142
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,959
this one and I actually left on a lot of

143
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:36,120
the foliage on this one uh contrary to

144
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,159
the one in the upper right corner

145
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,379
because again these two have the same

146
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,160
morphology same bud structure all of

147
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:46,860
that stuff and uh I wanted to see how

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,220
hard I go on the thinning

149
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,840
will it affect those buds so this is the

150
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,360
one in the front left corner here's that

151
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,339
plant in the upper right corner the one

152
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,860
where you can see I defoliated a lot of

153
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,779
the big lease off of it oh that's a

154
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,759
fresh Kool-Aid man in the back don't

155
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:05,219
mind that but we're looking at the one

156
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,160
with the buds on it and yeah as you can

157
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,919
see I did the defoliation so it's really

158
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,220
just kind of arm sticking off but as you

159
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:17,219
can see all of the arms uh they've got

160
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,860
really good dense Bud coverage on them

161
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,340
so not a lot of ways to space not a lot

162
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,160
of wasted Lumber this is the one in the

163
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:28,379
upper front right corner and we've got

164
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,919
the one in the very center of the tent

165
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:34,918
uh this one too I defoliated it so it's

166
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:37,799
just kind of got the arm sticking off

167
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,659
full of buds you know nice dense Buzz

168
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,120
structure I'm pretty stoked again the

169
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,759
nakatomi plaza is kind of put out for

170
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,340
you it's going to be a producer

171
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,680
um yeah this is the one in the center so

172
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:52,138
stoked with that here we take a look at

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,060
the one in the back left corner this is

174
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,879
the one that had a whole bunch of purple

175
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,819
with it uh you know again chunking up

176
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,939
nice and good a lot of beautiful purple

177
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,280
colors on this plant again this was the

178
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:08,279
one that reminds me of the westport's

179
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:11,279
grape juice the most uh just by the way

180
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,019
the bud is the way it grew and the way

181
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,098
it looks so

182
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,959
yeah this is the one in the back corner

183
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:20,878
all right the back right corner is what

184
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,579
we're looking at right now and this one

185
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,860
has put on some pretty nice buds you

186
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:28,378
know pretty solid the Leafs look like

187
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,180
there's a little bit of nutrient Burns

188
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:33,360
or damage and again this is just water

189
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,320
only uh the soham living soil with that

190
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,418
one top amendment of uh kiss Organics

191
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,879
nutrients but these things are really

192
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,519
stacking and honestly uh this thing is

193
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,320
probably going to put on the most weight

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,019
I'm stoked about it it smells good it's

195
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,480
got good tricum coverage but yeah it's

196
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:55,139
just pretty dense it's putting on

197
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,420
the thick Cola so that's the one in the

198
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:59,639
back right corner so that's what we're

199
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:02,219
looking at day 51 the flower the

200
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,019
nakatomi plaza uh I'll probably well

201
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,580

202
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,860
harvest maybe it will be the Harvest

203
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,200

204
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,839

205
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,420
