1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,759
hey we're back this is the plant that I

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,280
uh showed you all the other day that I

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,280
was doing the regrow on and you can see

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,759
how once we've got some good growth we

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,000
could cut back on all that extra

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,199
material but there was a lot of

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,800
questions about the process and so I

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,199
wanted to show you a couple plants that

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
I did at the same time so you can kind

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,519
of see the difference in pace

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,039
so uh and and it's it's important so

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,358
that you understand about patience right

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,160
so this plant has uh Mexican gentic and

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,320
TI genetics in so it has

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:38,519
equatorial and I didn't breathe this

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,280
this is from uh Charles Scott's work but

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,120
the equatorial genetics affect the pace

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,120
of flowering how it shifts into

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,359
flowering how it shifts back out of

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,119
flowering and so if you take a look and

21
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,640
what I call it I call it determinant

22
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,079
meaning that once these hormones have

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,878
kicked in to drive the reproductive

24
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,198
process they want to stay in motion and

25
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,640
the more the northern latitude or

26
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,479
Southern latitude depending on what side

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,600
of the Equator you're on

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,478
the further you're away from the equator

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,599
the more determinant the plan is so this

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,280
particular one is kind of plastic

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,519
because of that equitorial nature or you

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,478
know 15

33
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:16,039
latitude but we come over here and you

34
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:18,799
can see this kill aash plant that I

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,560
created now this one is a cherry pie and

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,720
I used a a gny Afghani as the pollinator

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,879
for it right and now this is just

38
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,599
beginning to pop out and this plant was

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,478
so nice this is I just was on first

40
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:34,478
smoke of the day and this is the plant

41
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:36,599
that uh Alex and Lena washed so I could

42
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,759
bring it down and this stuff was just

43
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,559
foul I mean just screaming so I really

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,399
wanted to come back but you can see the

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,600
the how slow it is where this one's

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,200
already fully developed and going this

47
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,879
one's just initiating and you can start

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,520
to see here if I pull it in where the

49
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,199
bracks are kind of open back up and you

50
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,359
can see the color change it just says

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,200
hey we're starting to return to

52
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,399
juvenility we're starting to move

53
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,759
forward and then we go over to this one

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,280
that's kind of between both and this is

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:10,399
a Skittle that I used uh

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,199
F3 red Leb Puck mail on and out of the

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
there out of the total sift all these

58
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,799
three plants they came out of about 300

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,680
so six tables of

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,239
50 and this was by far the the best of

61
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,400
the red Le pucks into the skittle and

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,959
this was just phenomenal hash plan I'm

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,519
glad I get to capture it and this one as

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,640
well but you can see the difference in

65
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,280
that that shift where this is really

66
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:35,159
beginning to start to open up and once I

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
start to get some true development I'll

68
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,519
be able to carve away some of this plant

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,879
material this one is just beginning and

70
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,000
you can see some signs here where you

71
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:48,919
can see the color change but a lot of it

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,800
is for me with the with the root it's to

73
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,479
cut back the root ball a little bit and

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
then put it into a smaller pot so I'm

75
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,158
not having to constantly up poot what I

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,239
want is I want a wet dry cycle so just

77
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,560
like when your crop stering in a cube

78
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,719
smaller Cube cubes give you better

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,158
control same thing with this is that I

80
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,280
want this to be able to go through a wet

81
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,479
dry cycle so I initiate root stimulation

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,039
and then what I do is I take the plants

83
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,079
and if you can see how it's grown you

84
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,959
can see there was another side here what

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,040
I do is I create this this this V and it

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,000
lets me chop half the plant off for the

87
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,000
smoke test and then the other half I let

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,598
hang on to regrow so I have material it

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,639
it it likes you know moderate nitrogen

90
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,479
nothing excessive it likes sunlight

91
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,598
really so if you could put it outside

92
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,399
and then bring it in at night and

93
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:39,199
stimulate with some extra light so that

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,080
you uh keep the flower response down and

95
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,959
just be patient but you can see the huge

96
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,040
difference in speed where this

97
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,360
plant is fully vegetative and and in the

98
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,840
mood to grow this one is just starting

99
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,959
to break free and this one's in the

100
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,039
process in between both but the point is

101
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,199
that you know in a perfect world we hold

102
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,759
clones but I would have had a pull I

103
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,438
would have had to pull 300 plugs and I

104
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,759
would have had hold 300 plugs for month

105
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:07,680
and a half minimum right so I mean I

106
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,679
don't even want to track them when

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,360
they're flowering I don't want to deal

108
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,319
with it in the tray so say just say you

109
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,160
know full two months so 300 plants for

110
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,719
two months while we're flowering 300

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,000
plants it's just a pain in the neck and

112
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,160
so I used to do it when I had the

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,040
facility to hold the material but now

114
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,240
that everything's so highly regulated

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,639
you don't get to play some of these

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,600
games with your own

117
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,400
projects and so I went back to just

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,280
doing vegetative work where I allow the

119
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,000
plants that are outliers I make the

120
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,879
selections and I do the smoke test and

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,959
this one looks like holy hell right now

122
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,800
but my God this thing was a screamer man

123
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,399
what a stunner like the aroma was

124
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,400
fantastic mouth was powdered sugar

125
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,439
orange

126
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:50,959
spritzer and early finish just gorgeous

127
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,439
morphology so I had to keep it it was by

128
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,959
far the best one of that whole that

129
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,240
whole hunt and just by being patient

130
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,680
here we go and you can see it but that's

131
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,360
what you want that's typically what you

132
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,600
end up getting and that's a transition

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,680
and so just learn that you're just got

134
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,320
to take your time and be patient and

135
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,199
allow it to happen the longest it's ever

136
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,439
taken is probably I want to say over 5

137
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,199
months on a variety that was so

138
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,879
determinant that it literally stayed

139
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,319
almost in stasis for two and a half

140
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,959
months where it didn't even change it

141
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,000
just was like frozen but we just decided

142
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,198
let's see what

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,600
happens and lo and behold over the

144
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,079
course of the next 3 months it emerged

145
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,400
and we were able to pull a copy and we

146
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,560
had a really valuable plant that we

147
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,519
would lost otherwise so a lot of it is

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,800
just take your time and and make sure

149
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,318
that you don't start chopping out too

150
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,520
much material because you don't have

151
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,439
enough enough Leaf material here to

152
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,959
really Drive root health so once we

153
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,839
start to have enough

154
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,839
material then we're able to have a

155
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,399
healthy bottom end healthy top end now

156
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:55,638
we go into into vegetative and now we

157
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,638
have the plant so have a great day
