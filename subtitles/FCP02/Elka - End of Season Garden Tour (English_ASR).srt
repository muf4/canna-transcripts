00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,440
chrysanthemums is look how they're all

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,599
splotchy is we've had a lot of rain

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,599
lately and it's like the rain has

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,879
kind of washed the pink off of them it's

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,920
pretty cool

9
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,919
so start there

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,559
the

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,439
chia is flowering

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,439
it's a beautiful thing

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,198
butterfly bushes are still going

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,320
purple one

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,238

16
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,439
another big chrysanthemum

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,439
i just like how it

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,600
like all splotchy and

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
it's like it's being washed off pretty

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,520
cool

21
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,839
it's a big patch of lemon balm right

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
here

23
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,280
that's brahma

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,760
all right this is this is why i'm doing

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,159
this video it's just everything's so

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,478
lush and beautiful it's

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,118
i hope this video turns out well

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,799
this is the tetragonia

29
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,079
it's got a lot of seeds on it i don't

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,280
know if i can get down there and show

31
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,158
you some of these little seeds

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,159
developing on here

33
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:36,078
there's one it's a weird little

34
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,680
thing it'll dry out and turn brown

35
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,438
it's like a little

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,439
i don't know there's like actually like

37
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,919
four or five seeds in that in all of

38
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,559
those and hopefully it seeds itself it's

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
a large nasturtium patch

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,118
i've been picking at all of this stuff

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,118
we've been eating a lot of salads

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,118
can't even tell

43
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,920
there's my my parsleys

44
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,239
at

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
all three different types right there

46
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,879
oh

47
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,759
parsley is really good i think they've

48
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,920
actually

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,718
reclassified it into a vegetable from an

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,799
herb

51
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,478
because of the nutrition in it that's

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
why it's one of the things in chicken

53
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,400
noodle soup that helps you those in the

54
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,318
onions

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,760
anyway so yeah this fern leaf is really

56
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,318
pretty

57
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,318
that's new

58
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,639
can't remember what it's called but it's

59
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,238
burpee just put that out this year

60
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,919
there's other fern leafs i've seen but

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,120
that one

62
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,839
that's the only that's the one i got

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,840
these are carrots

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,639
do a little bit of weeding but it

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,800
doesn't really matter it's going to help

66
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,079
them make it through the winter it's i

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,319
think they're going to be big enough to

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,000
make it got radishes

69
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,079
got black radishes

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,280
right here black spanish radishes i hope

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,959
they make it through the winter like

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
they're supposed to and then on the

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,479
other side of the okra we've got the uh

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,159
the large daikons and i i'm familiar

75
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,639
with those actually

76
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,079
yeah this is i've run these a lot

77
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,919
and they they last through the winter

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,239
and it creates great chicken food those

79
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,439
greens you just leave them in the ground

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,800
and you got

81
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,800
nice nutritious

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,239
chicken greens

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,920
uh there's some more carrots

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,158
doing a lot of carrots over wintering

85
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,318
this year it's they they should make it

86
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,399
they're they're big enough i planted a

87
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,560
little late but

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
got uh

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
yes tetragona is just

90
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,719
this is probably one of my favorite

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,120
plants

92
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,439
and i love this stuff it's

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,439
i love blt's in the summer and this is

94
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,199
this is lettuce that takes the heat

95
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,799
here's some speaking of lettuce we got

96
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,719
some uh

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,879
i'll call this oak leaf but they they

98
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,318
said it's salad bowl so

99
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,959
we'll go with

100
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,719
what they called it but yeah this stuff

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,519
that one's probably not going to last as

102
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,280
long as this one over here now sylvia i

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
am very familiar with

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,560
this is new to me

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
i can't remember the name of that but

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,479
the uh this the silvia lettuce is

107
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,598
pretty cool

108
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,679
love this stuff last last into the the

109
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,438
cold weather for a little bit

110
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,799
for something with such tender leaves on

111
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,359
it you know it's

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,360
anyway good stuff got raspberries these

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
are heritage raspberries that i just

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
planted this year

115
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,439
uh this spring and as they said that

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,959
they would fruit the first year and they

117
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,199
they have so

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,959
yeah and have a lot of those i got to

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
pick all the wild blackberries around

120
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,239
here so that i don't have disease issues

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,319
with these but

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,079
that's a bit of a chore but i'll get rid

123
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,040
of them eventually this is a mustard

124
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,279
greens

125
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,520
great in a salad it's it's delicious

126
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,359
stuff it's it tastes sort of like kale

127
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,279
same sort of flavor

128
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,720
same family and everything too i think

129
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,638
all the seeds look the same this is

130
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,440
spinach that's a bloomsdale

131
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,360
long-standing spinach

132
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,959
uh these are little white icicle

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,040
radishes

134
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,279
these these are delicious little things

135
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,360
they got a little bit of spice to them

136
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,279
they call it a mild radish but it's

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
they're they're still spicy

138
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,119
and back here i did have peas but i have

139
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,280
learned that

140
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,840
even if you plant them far far enough

141
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,079
away to where the ducks can't reach them

142
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,119
when they're young they they just sniff

143
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,560
them out

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,160
i got to do peas in the center of the

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
garden from now on because of these

146
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,439
ducks

147
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,160
so yeah that's i think that's pretty

148
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,120
much everything is here's my basil

149
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,439
i

150
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,000
chopped a lot of the the top of it off

151
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,680
so i can collect some nice

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,279
delicious green stuff like this you

153
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
don't you don't need a lot of this stuff

154
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,319
so it's and it's really easy to dry so

155
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,599
yeah i'm really proud of this basil

156
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,519
so that's

157
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,720
that's the garden hope you all have a

158
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,719
nice day
