00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,759
hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,120
and thank you for joining us today my

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,880
name is chad westport

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,879
and today i'm going to show you how to

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,719
take clones taking clones is a

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,960
relatively simple process

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,399
a process that every grower should know

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
and the reason i say that

10
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,839
is because if you know how to take a

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,199
clone then you're able to

12
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,118
keep a single seed going for many years

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,880
and in the case of finding a winner or

14
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,518
something that works great for you

15
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,879
it's a really handy tool to have and

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,439
speaking of tools

17
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,200
i like to get all of my tools laid out

18
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,000
before i actually start cutting on the

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
plant

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,679
that way i can take my clone dip it in

21
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,279
what i need to

22
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,200
and stick it straight in the medium of

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,558
choice and today

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,399
i'm going to show you two different

25
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,919
mediums i'll show you how to do it in

26
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,359
soil or cocoa

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,760
and then i'm also going to show you the

28
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,799
aeroponic cloner

29
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,558
soil and cocoa pretty simple process it

30
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,078
requires only a few tools

31
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,679
and i do like to get those laid out

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,359
beforehand

33
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,799
i'm only going to be taking clones off

34
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
of one plant today but when you're

35
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,118
taking clones off of multiple plants

36
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,040
now is the time to label them accurately

37
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,079
and do be sure to use a pen

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,240
that isn't going to smear or run off

39
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,840
with water because these are going to

40
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,399
get wet

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,478
and the reason i have three out today is

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,520
we're going to try three different

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:26,079
styles we're going to try dipping

44
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,280
one into clonex gel which is a rooting

45
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,438
hormone

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,840
we're going to dip another into aloe

47
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,798
vera which is kind of your organic or

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,280
natural

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
hormone rooting gel and then we're going

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,759
to do one

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,438
without anything and we're just going to

52
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,239
see which ones root first

53
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,000
or root best or have the best growth the

54
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,719
other tool that you'll notice here

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,078
is a fresh clean razor blade this is

56
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,519
something that you want to do

57
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:54,000
on each plant that you take clones from

58
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,759
i use a clean razor blade on every plant

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,159
for my ipm

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,239
because i know that pathogens can spread

61
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,240
easily through the sap of plants

62
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,798
and if i take a clone from an infected

63
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:08,079
plant and get the sap on the blade

64
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,239
and then go to another plant cut into it

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,520
i've just transferred my pathogen and

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,920
that's bad news so

67
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,879
good ipm says fresh razor blade for

68
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,238
every plant

69
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,159
i also have ph water it's important i

70
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,759
want to make sure my water is ph

71
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,479
and that's going to give the roots a

72
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,840
best chance to take off

73
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,199
i have pre-watered my soil mix and the

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
reason i do that

75
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,679
is to grow roots you're going to want

76
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
water but you also need oxygen

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,280
and i've found that if you dip straight

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
into the dry soil

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,598
and then you water it there's a chance

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,759
for pockets or dry spots around the stem

81
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,959
and we don't want that so i always water

82
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,199
it ahead of time

83
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,159
get the soil nice and saturated but not

84
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,839
soaked

85
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,680
and then i stick my clone right in

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,039
so let's get started and look at the

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,560
plant and see where we're going to take

88
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,759
our clones from

89
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,439
generally you're going to want to take

90
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,239
your clones from the lower portion of

91
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,158
the plant

92
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,519
now if you clean your plant up before

93
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,598
you put it into flour

94
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,280
meaning you take off the lower branches

95
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,000
that's a great time to select your

96
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,598
clones

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,519
and that's exactly what i'm going to do

98
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,158
here there's some that are a little bit

99
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
too long

100
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,439
there's some that are a little bit too

101
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,399
short everybody's going to have a

102
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,800
different size

103
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,560
of clone that they're going to take i

104
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,519
prefer to take them a little bit on the

105
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,519
smaller side

106
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,439
that just works for me and i go from the

107
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,959
lower portion but again because i'm

108
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,239
going into soil with this

109
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
i want to make sure it's a little bit

110
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,120
longer so i can get some depth down

111
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,759
into the soil compared to with my arrow

112
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,719
cloner

113
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,598
because i don't have 101 camera angles

114
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,400
i'm going to do this

115
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,439
in steps one two three four but it's

116
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,719
basically one

117
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,280
fluid movement from the time that i cut

118
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,359
it

119
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,199
to the time that i dip it to the time

120
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
that i put it into the soil

121
00:03:49,199 --> 00:04:01,839
so let's go ahead and cut this one at

122
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:01,840
the 45 degree angle

123
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,078
and this one we dipped in the clonex so

124
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,798
we're gonna label it

125
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,879
clonex okay we know which one that

126
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,478
is okay i've selected another good one

127
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,040
here it's from the lower portion of the

128
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,279
plant

129
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,160
it has enough space to bury underneath

130
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,758
the soil

131
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,320
so we're gonna go ahead and cut this one

132
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,319
off and dip it in our aloe vera

133
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,519
you can see the 45 degree angle that

134
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,758
i've cut onto

135
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:49,039
this stem see it's open-faced

136
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,040
that's the angle we're looking for here

137
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,319
i'm gonna scrape this one again so let

138
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,879
me just show you that you're just gonna

139
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,478
gently scrape the outside layer

140
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,399
and what that's going to do is that's

141
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:04,240
going to promote more rooting sites

142
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,758
but you don't want to go too deep again

143
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,400
it's just that outer layer it's like

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,319
you're

145
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,839
peeling a vegetable or something peeling

146
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:15,439
a carrot

147
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,560
okay let me put my hole

148
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:23,600
into the soil take

149
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,600
my clone with no treatment on there and

150
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,000
drop it right on in

151
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,079
give a little bit of uh give it a hug

152
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,560
because we love our clones clones are

153
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,879
good to us so let's be good to them

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,280
and this one we're gonna just write

155
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,279
nothing because we've done nothing to it

156
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,000
okay so the last step for these are to

157
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,000
get the humidity dome on

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,600
and generate a little bit of humidity

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,319
all right we're about ready to finish

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,039
these off

161
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,079
we've got our three clones the aloe vera

162
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,199
the clonex

163
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:04,318
and the nothing we've got that

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,759
in our tray we got our tray

165
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,000
on our heat mat move that back there

166
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,600
we've got our humidity dome and a little

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,959
trick i like to do to kind of get the

168
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,600
humidity going

169
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:20,478
is take your ph water ph

170
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,400
spray the inside of your dome just give

171
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,079
it a little bit of

172
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,918
a little bit of life a little bit of

173
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,079
something to drip

174
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,439
a little spray a little spray on the

175
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,279
bottom of the tray too

176
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:35,038
that's always nice spray the leaves

177
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,879
because this is how they're going to get

178
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,279
water real gently

179
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,319
there's no roots for them to feed water

180
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,399
so they gotta feed

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,039
foliar give them a little spray

182
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,519
all right it looks good to go let me put

183
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,959
on the lid

184
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:56,478
put my tray on like that i'm gonna close

185
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,638
the vent holes on the top

186
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:01,439
and we're good we're gonna let it sit

187
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,120
and clones are gonna grow

188
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,120
we're going to finish up here by taking

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,319
three more clones off the lower portion

190
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,720
of this plant

191
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,759
and these are going to the aeroponic

192
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,759
cloner machine

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,199
which is my personal preference and i

194
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,840
also tend to take them a little bit

195
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,680
shorter

196
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,119
that way the stems don't sit down into

197
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
the water so

198
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,399
this one we've got a short one here that

199
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,159
i'll use this one

200
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,799
oh geez it's only about three inches

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
tall we've got another one over here

202
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,960
it's about seven inches tall but this

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
one i'm going to take in the middle

204
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,560
now you typically want to take it at

205
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,959
like a nodal space right in the crux

206
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,280
there

207
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,638
supposed to be more growth hormones but

208
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,758
you know what i'm going to slice this

209
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,079
one in the middle

210
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
just to show you that it can be done and

211
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,560
then beyond that we've got this one back

212
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,280
here

213
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,079
which is well it's a normal size so

214
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,079
we'll take that one

215
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,759
okay let's take our middle cut our

216
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,439
middle cut again even though it's in the

217
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,639
middle we're going to do it at a 45

218
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,319
degree angle

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,918
see if i can move this out of the way

220
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,360
here and then get you a good example of

221
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,639
the cut

222
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,960
oh okay we got the cut

223
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,879
and oh shoot see i messed that up i

224
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,560
scraped too hard

225
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,919
that one's trash okay we're gonna have

226
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,839
to go for another one

227
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,318
but we'll get this middle one so let's

228
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,318
do that

229
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,120
okay so here's my arrow cloner machine

230
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,639
with the three empty holes we're about

231
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,199
to fill with the clones that we just

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,519
took

233
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,800
let's lift the hood real quick though

234
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,120
and as you can see

235
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,399
under here there is a mister a bunch of

236
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,599
misters actually that

237
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,759
spray all of the cut of the clones

238
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,039
and from there it forms roots we just

239
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,039
take our plugs

240
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:51,039
that we just took we drop them in there

241
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:54,159
here's our short one drop that in there

242
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,759
and our cut from the middle

243
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,079
so there you have it we don't need a

244
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,759
humidity dome we're seven days

245
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,600
into the cloning project and i've

246
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,319
removed my humidity dome

247
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,759
and this applies to any time if you come

248
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
back and you see that your leaves are

249
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,240
dry

250
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,519
give them a little spray because until

251
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,959
they have roots

252
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,200
this is how they're going to get water

253
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,599
and feed all right

254
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,240
so all of them have pressure in the

255
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,879
leaves

256
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,639
so i can tell that something is going on

257
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,360
you can't see the roots so you don't

258
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,159
know

259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,519
but the aloe vera the clonex and the one

260
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,120
that we did nothing to

261
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,839
they all look the same they all look

262
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
good the clones in the soil were looking

263
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,760
good

264
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,919
but we don't really know if they have

265
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,879
roots yet with the arrow cloner we'll be

266
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,879
able to tell

267
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,159
so let's take a look at our cuttings we

268
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,519
have the cut that we took from the

269
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,719
middle of the branch we put

270
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,240
nothing on it i don't see

271
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,959
any roots yet okay we also have

272
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,759
the medium-sized cut that we dipped in

273
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,399
the aloe

274
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,399
yeah okay a couple little roots on there

275
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,759
it's gonna have more days in the aero

276
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,919
cloner i'd say at least in

277
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:05,039
the yeah more time and then we have our

278
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,360
shortest cut with the clonex that

279
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:11,919
definitely has roots on it

280
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:15,039
so as far as the arrow cloner race goes

281
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,799
clonex wins there you have it

282
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,319
thank you for tuning in to my rough

283
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,639
guide on taking clones

284
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:29,040
this is chad westport and please join me

285
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:29,039
again next time
