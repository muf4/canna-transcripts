1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,200
you know last week um we did a strain

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,880
history thing on uh on on the white

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,519
family White Widow White Russian white

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,798
uh you know great white shark all that

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,359
kind of stuff White Rhino and you know I

6
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,800
I've mentioned before

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,640
that one of the things we wanted this to

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,839
do was rather than be some sort of like

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,920
definitive layout of what happened that

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,480
we would tell things as best we knew

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,679
them okay and that we welcomed people

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,679
that were in in the know or had

13
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:39,359
information or what have you uh to come

14
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:42,039
out and to um you know message us or

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,238
talk to us or what have you about all

16
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:47,719
that that added more information we

17
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:51,799
didn't know and some Nuance right and

18
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:55,600
so after we did that uh that happened in

19
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:58,759
Spades uh because because Shanti Baba

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,800
reached out uh with a bunch of claric

21
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:04,158
with a bunch of clarification on our

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:07,239
white right uh show so I thought it

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,040
would be I thought it would be cool to

24
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:12,478
uh read and comment a little bit back

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,920
and forth on some of the things he said

26
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,879
so we could add his take uh you know to

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,599
it give our own opinion whatnot then

28
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,640
we'll dive into this week's strain

29
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,239
history and then we'll dive into sort of

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,759
like the the core of this week's show I

31
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,560
guess right so I'll start out I'm going

32
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,640
to look down because I have to read read

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,799
this um and this is actually pretty

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,960
interesting because it goes into uh uh

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,600
it goes into um some of the shadiness

36
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:47,199
that goes on in in our world right and

37
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,879
so he wrote and said um arjan or

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,960
Greenhouse seedco never trademark

39
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,640
adjectives like white widow or right

40
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,679
White Rhino Etc as it is not allowed to

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,920
own the name it is only they only put

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,320
the reg the regulation symbol to let

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,519
people think this I Chang the names of

44
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,359
the strains to do the correct thing when

45
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:08,560
leaving a company so as to make clear

46
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,159
the distinction and no people would know

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
when they were buying things from me and

48
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,680
when they were buying things from the

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,719
previous uh you know previous regime

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,800
so what's interesting about that is that

51
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,000
when I read that I was super amused okay

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,920
because obviously when you see a

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,318
trademark symbol next to a name okay you

54
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,559
assume something right you you know yeah

55
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:37,159
and and sometimes assumptions makes you

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,000
a a-hole right because yeah how you and

57
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,158
so Argent did this thing apparently

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,158
which was very clever and that he

59
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:45,878
figured if he put a trademark symbol on

60
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:49,079
it he wouldn't get caught and everyone

61
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:52,479
would assume that he had done

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,319
it seems reasonable so that that's

63
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,158
that's that's pretty clever I always

64
00:02:54,318 --> 00:03:00,079
thought because when you would buy those

65
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:01,959
packs after Shanti left um they would

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,599
all have the trademark symbol and then

67
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,439
he changed all the names yeah you know

68
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,318
and so you think okay well he obviously

69
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,680
had to change the names because there

70
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:14,958
was trademark

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,319
involved right right and apparently uh

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,759
that was totally

73
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,639
untrue and it was just a thing by

74
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,719
Greenhouse to make people assume that

75
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,719
that was

76
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,840
true yeah and it probably is also for

77
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:31,039
the best because when someone leaves a

78
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,840
company and when they're going to you

79
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,639
know go off and do their own thing I

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,640
mean seed reproductions have to occur

81
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,759
you know existing stock doesn't last

82
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:44,598
forever so there likely is you know a

83
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,679
distinct difference even even if it

84
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:48,479
takes a year or two to occur between the

85
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,719
same line even if it had the same

86
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,919
progator sold by two different companies

87
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,438
because your seed stock will run up and

88
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,438
you will have to make new and you will

89
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:01,400
not have the exact parents especially

90
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:02,919
you know if you let somewhere you know

91
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,640
not on the best terms not every as a

92
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,280
buddy [ __ ] splitting up everything on

93
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,039
the way out like there will be a

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
distinct difference so even Beyond you

95
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,639
know the trademark it was probably in

96
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,000
the best interest you know for people to

97
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,279
be able to decide what version they

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,720
liked so I'm going so Peter put

99
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,159
something up a little bit I'm going to

100
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,000
read it actually because I have it in

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,439
front of me because I think shanti's um

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,399
shanti's words deserve he's he's a

103
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,000
really an OG in the scene and has done a

104
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,719
lot of work and contributed a lot of

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,279
lines to the so I think it's probably

106
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,600
cool to just like say his own words

107
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:39,799
about the subject and then uh we'll chat

108
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,240
on in a minute uh he said I also made

109
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,639
the seed versions of all that you

110
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,360
discussed as ingamar story of finding a

111
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,038
seed in a piece of hash does not allow

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,360
for breeding unless it was chemically

113
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,279
induced but really if you follow things

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,160
a bit further like breeds called

115
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,799
critical mass or super silver haze or

116
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,160
the CBD strains you will clearly see I

117
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,000
went on with seed breeding and

118
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,439
Innovation While most others went for

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,759
sales of fem seed I'm not making an

120
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,279
opinion just stating facts since this

121
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,759
Widow seed came out in 1995 if you look

122
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,959
prior to them where there was no seed

123
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,280
for Widow nowhere it was just a plant

124
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,799
and a cutting story so while I do not

125
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,918
really care anymore about what stories

126
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,360
are popularized I find it amazing that

127
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,879
people still have their theories when

128
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,680
all seed companies who copied my seed

129
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,439
version use my words that were written

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,319
up by me in the greenhouse seed Cod days

131
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,959
no one really uses anything from arjin

132
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,439
or imar when it boils down to

133
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,079
descriptions so I hope that clears up

134
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,319
some of the EXP some of some of the

135
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,839
thoughts and some of the stories from

136
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,160
the early 99s be well all the best

137
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,879
Shanti Baba

138
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,759
so uh a couple things I'll say about

139
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,199
that and then I'll turn it over to

140
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,439
Crybaby for one I should not that it

141
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,720
matters but I should put my finger on

142
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:53,959
the scale and say that I tend to believe

143
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,000
Shanti Baba okay um we were just trying

144
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:59,439
to offer up the two stories that existed

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,800
right I'm sure if you're Shanti and you

146
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,478
and you created it and you popularized

147
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,800
it and all that it was probably a little

148
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:10,680
bit of a bummer to hear a a version you

149
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,280
know that in included someone else um

150
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,038
but I will say I do believe him and for

151
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,439
all intents and purposes he is

152
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:21,759
absolutely correct in that the larger

153
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:24,639
weed scene had never heard of white

154
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,520
widow right he is the person that

155
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,000
released the seeds and the early hybrids

156
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:35,399
of it and so every single person that

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,439
bought those got Shanti Baba's work

158
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,758
right no that's 100% accurate right I

159
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,519
mean that's really what happen so you

160
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,080
know um and you know so everyone's

161
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,198
getting Shanti Baba's work whether it

162
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,719
was at Greenhouse Seed Co or later on at

163
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,759
Mr Nice or what have you um it was

164
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,280
Shanti making the seeds it was Shanti

165
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,120
selling the seeds um you know whether or

166
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,239
not you know this clone story or

167
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,160
whatever is true or not it was very

168
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,680
localized to Amsterdam's Holland right

169
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,639
and Shanti Baba releasing the white

170
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,038
family under the greenhouse label in the

171
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:17,240
mid 90s is absolutely what put it on the

172
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,759
map right sure yeah um so we don't you

173
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,400
know I mean I I just wanted to throw

174
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,038
that out there where you know we we're

175
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:29,279
trying to be objective and offer things

176
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:31,199
that we know right um and you know so

177
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,719
that's that's we've had two things now

178
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,520
with our stories the first was bod bod

179
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,039
giving us some information that Jim

180
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:41,439
Ortega had given him about the Kush 4

181
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:44,079
which was lovely addition to that and

182
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,478
now we have Shanti coming in and talking

183
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,680
about the white family and adding some

184
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,560
trademarks and some extra like you know

185
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,759
Nuance to it and stuff which I think is

186
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,158
also super

187
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,598
cool and there's also something to be

188
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,079
discussed about there is a difference

189
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:59,759
especially in the canas community

190
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,959
between you know what we could called

191
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:07,919
like true origin the very very first

192
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:09,560
iteration and you know projection of

193
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,799
something onto the community and then we

194
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,720
can say you know when was you know

195
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,840
Community spread and popularization

196
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,400
occurring you know as as much as I hate

197
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:20,758
to say it you know sour is a great

198
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:24,560
example of that there are people who had

199
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,639
that those plants that plant Etc very

200
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,038
early however when you look at the

201
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,080
broadscale popularization of that plant

202
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:34,319
when the masses got it what they might

203
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,839
know of it might be a little bit

204
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,399
different for people

205
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:43,000
so there is something to be said about

206
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,600
whether or not the origin of a story

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,919
relates exactly to how everyone knows

208
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:54,040
the end point result and regardless of

209
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:56,719
how white widow might have got there the

210
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,480
point is and very true that if you were

211
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,920
into white widow if you bought seeds if

212
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,079
you grew plants if you grew hybrids you

213
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:07,120
did grow shanti's version and barring as

214
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:09,439
far as you know people with a you know

215
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,759
expansive reach and reputation barring

216
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,040
Luke from Paradise I don't know anybody

217
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,278
at all who has a prolific breeding

218
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,078
program and you know cites White Widow

219
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:23,278
as being critical to the greater part of

220
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:26,359
their world and what they've developed

221
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:29,039
besides him you know and and it it's

222
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,360
that's I'm not saying that one's better

223
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,639
I've never seen them run side by side

224
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,200
I've never seen any of that

225
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,519
however how it got there how people know

226
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,320
it definitely is mostly single source

227
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,200
and the handful of people otherwise you

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,879
know what they have to say is equally as

229
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,160
valuable however on a broad scale White

230
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,639
Widow you are talking about Greenhouse

231
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,159
or Mr Nice Seed origin plant and

232
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,879
everybody everybody that bought White

233
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,399
Widow and crossed because it was a

234
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,439
regular seed line obviously and and uh

235
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,159
back then everyone that bought it and

236
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,440
crossed it to things and made hybrids of

237
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,958
it of their own and everything else um

238
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:13,320
you were buying the you know what Shanti

239
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:15,359
had created uh for sale right so um we

240
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,440
don't need to we don't need to Deep dive

241
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,079
too much more into that except for I

242
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,680
would like to say that uh we view the

243
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:26,519
strain history portion right as a

244
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,319
continuing conversation Absolut okay and

245
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,560
so it's lovely that he was a list

246
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,839
listening and B was willing to add his

247
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,199
thoughts and critiques right and so you

248
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,600
are

249
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,639
like yeah willing to engage and be

250
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,360
polite and nice about it and stuff so if

251
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,200
we're talking about something and you

252
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,959
have an area of knowledge about that and

253
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
you're like oh that was wrong or that

254
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,000
that was this or that was kind of right

255
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,959
but there's this context to it by all

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,759
means reach out please and it'll

257
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:59,479
probably end up you know like on the

258
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,439
continuing conversation like we did now
