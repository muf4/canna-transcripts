00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,980
cultivating bringing unique terpenes

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,059
unique profiles unique flavors to the

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,039
people

11
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,538

00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:45,299
years yeah I was like going through the

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,878
emerald cup 2021 with the whole kova

19
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,218
thing and it's like we won second place

20
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:53,820
in Sun grown and Breeders Cup and it was

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,320
like no one knows yeah totally so thank

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,179
God we're out here and we get to show

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,399
the trophies and get that herb out to

24
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,780
everybody and I'm so glad you mentioned

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,460
that because we were at that award

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,099
ceremony in LA

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,140
and afterwards we're like I'm not sure

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,599
who won what yeah it's a little

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,760
confusing I get it though you know you

30
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,819
did a great job yes or what it was good

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,799
job yeah absolutely make the best of

32
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:20,279
what we had yeah I mean they had one

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,439
right so exactly and we did good so

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,219
we're proud and it was one year that

35
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,559
that we had just entered in Three Blind

36
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,239
strains that he had been working on I

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
mean blind like no one knows they're

38
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,298
there

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,340
um just things we've been developing on

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,500
the farm for years and we finally

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,719
decided that we're gonna get them out

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,060
that we've gone and threw our Fino hunt

43
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,179
and we've picked and we made sure these

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,000
are the ones that we want and uh we had

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,540
three different strains and they placed

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,599
um second 19th and then we missed the

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,840
top 20 by one so out of the three

48
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,239
strange we were up in the top

49
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,020
20s

50
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:07,798
right yeah and uh having our our

51
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:08,959
forbidden fruit cherimoya 26 be you know

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,420
15

53
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,598
THC and take second place in the sun

54
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:18,719
grown and the Breeders Cup was just like

55
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:21,598
finally we got you know over the THC

56
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,840
thing and it's really about what it does

57
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,899
to you the effects the the high how you

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,180
feel the taste the smell the look it's

59
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,480
not just a piece of paper that says yeah

60
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,000
you have THC hot you win you know and so

61
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,919
it was just really good to see that what

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,259
we're doing is going in the right

63
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,139
direction and then just having those

64
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,719
strains low in the low THC Place High

65
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,699
was just like that was it for us

66
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,840
something we talk about often here you

67
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,179
know I'm definitely one of those people

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,340
that appreciates those main teams right

69
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,260
when it comes to THC yeah me too that's

70
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,180
what I want to smoke yeah one-to-ones

71
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,159
are going to be the future you own the

72
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,360
next couple of years watch if any of

73
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,340
these one-to-ones are really going to

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,160
take off where people are like I don't

75
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,459
no need to get that high I want to get

76
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,620
high and get influenced to do things or

77
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,000
get motivated and that's the you're

78
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,560
going to get that one-to-one where

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,900
you're really

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,640
comes down to where you can profile

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,800
yourself and you can find what works

82
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,658
good for you there's so much more

83
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,819
science involved now than when it was

84
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:25,560
just like here here's smoke that and see

85
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:28,199
if you like sativa or indica and now

86
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,300
it's like so far past all that those

87
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:34,158
lines are so blurry yeah because there's

88
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,159
sativas that are uplifting yeah

89
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:38,939
it's not just like it was where

90
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,459
everybody says sativism there's no

91
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,378
ground at the turkey most everything's a

92
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,959
hybrid these days anyway and they call

93
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:49,139
it an indica or sativa but really it's

94
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,580
been so breads both ways that those true

95
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:55,738
lines aren't really there exactly I feel

96
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,200
like the terpenes play such a role in

97
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,378
combination with the cannabinoid blend

98
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,539
it's not just THC it's not CBD it's CBG

99
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,459
it's CBN it's all these it's lesser

100
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,098
known and even under yeah even

101
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,680
undiscovered terpenes absolutely that's

102
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:13,500
the next thing it's like you see these

103
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,500
big spikes and they they do tests for 20

104
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,379
25 some tests for 85 different terpenes

105
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,238
but really you're not getting that you

106
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,459
know a terpene could have this much of a

107
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,739
mark on your graft and then one could

108
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,180
have this much but you're gonna taste

109
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,340
that little bit of that one because it's

110
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,379
so strong there's so many variants in

111
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:34,439
this terpene space that we don't even

112
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,540
know yet sorry and the way they interact

113
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,459
with the Cannabis receptors with the

114
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,199
cannabinoid receptors in our body like

115
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,959
oh there's just so much more science

116
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,520
that we need to continue to push to

117
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,060
learn this stuff but it keeps coming

118
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,799
back over and over to that sun grown is

119
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,899
better and you know as somebody who is

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,960
an indoor grower for most of my life I'm

121
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,120
a huge fan of indoor I love that loud

122
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:59,159
fresh yep but the science is proving

123
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,259
what we've known up here for a very long

124
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,240
time is that sun grown is better there's

125
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,000
a wider profile it affects you in a

126
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,220
different way I wouldn't have I I don't

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,620
know if I could say that in in just

128
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,639
saying it but having the data behind it

129
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:18,319
and the testing to to also back up my

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,540
nose which tells me what I'm looking for

131
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,639
you know it's really come a long ways to

132
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,199
where we're just we're really getting

133
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,160
that

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,560
that nose that fresh

135
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,759
I lost my place

136
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,978
that's awesome because that's actually

137
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,080
it sparked something in me that I

138
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:38,579
remember when you stopped by the booth

139
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,399
or we were talking to think Emerald cup

140
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,659
or Hollow flowers but since that moment

141
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,519
I've been wanting to get an opportunity

142
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,439
to speak with you you dropped a jar of

143
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,859
this on me and you were like yo take

144
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,360
this home yeah and it was like okay wait

145
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,860
but I want to talk more and we're both

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,038
going different directions and so we

147
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,600
didn't even really we're like we'll

148
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:59,219
catch up with you later all right and

149
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,020
this is the first opportunity since then

150
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,000
that we've gotten to connect yeah I have

151
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:05,339
to say tell us a little bit about this

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,139
genetic because it absolutely floored me

153
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,659
this is the forbidden fruit cherimoya

154
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:13,620
yes this is a forbidden fruit Jeremiah

155
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,320
it's a black on black it uh it'll turn

156
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,959
black only when it flowers the plant is

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,719
really almost a lime green and then as

158
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,519
soon as it starts to pod out the pods

159
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,180
are black from the beginning they're

160
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:29,099
that dark they don't get dark here

161
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,860
necessarily unless it's like a really

162
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,439
awesome cold snap at the very end but

163
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,600
that is what it's going to look like so

164
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,699
dark 100 degree weather it'll look that

165
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,160
way so you don't need the cold snap you

166
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,780
don't need anything

167
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,720

chedimoya version of it the end of it is

174
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:06,418
is basically is a really good friend of

175
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,579
mine who helped me breed all these he

176
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:11,279
had this lineage of this plant that he

177
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,680
had taken from Humboldt to Maui and

178
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:19,079
mixed in things like princess Bob and

179
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,319
Columbiana and Chris and headband and uh

180
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,359
like old school

181
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,759
granddaddy purps wow and he's been

182
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,800
breeding Out The Greener portion of it

183
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,220
all and getting like the really dark

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,020
black on black and then he crossed that

185
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,479
with the forbidden fruit that came up

186
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:40,620
with the chadamoya and then there was

187
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,418
green and totally dark purple phenos

188
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,899
through the whole thing and in every

189
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:48,478
spectrum of it in between and so this

190
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:51,060
one was the one that my nose it brought

191
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,098
me back to when I was in high school and

192
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,339
uh my senior year I was working for my

193
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:59,219
my girlfriend's dad in the field you

194
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,318
know out in summer growing some herb and

195
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,060
that's that smell I smell that I

196
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,400
remembered smelling back in the day and

197
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,339
it was this Indica Burmese

198
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,339
that he was uh he had his cross of and

199
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:14,939
it was just like train wreck just Groove

200
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:17,698
big buds purple on the stock as well as

201
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:20,639
green and just had this beautiful ribbon

202
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,379
running down it and that was the smell I

203
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,900
remembered looked totally different

204
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:28,139
growing than what I remember it looking

205
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:30,418
like but the nose was there and so it's

206
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,278
it was just like the one for me I picked

207
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,718
out before it was even done this is the

208
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,278
one I'm Gonna Keep I mean that's the

209
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,440
thing that you know the visual on that

210
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,799
obviously it's beautiful yeah the color

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,640
is just unreal the nose on them so

212
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,259
intricate and and unique yeah it hits me

213
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,480
right in the face it's like nothing I've

214
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,919
ever experienced before yeah this is my

215
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,200
experience too I looked at the jar I'm

216
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,479
like sweet thanks and then like get back

217
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,600
to my room and open it up I'm like whoa

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,580
this is special this is unique I've got

219
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,620
a good friend Jason Kane who did the

220
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,019
piano Bibles and he actually is out in

221
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,240
Maui and we've had this discussion a few

222
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,639
times and doing some judging for the

223
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,659
books and stuff

224
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,699
plants change when they go to Hawaii

225
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,559
like you can take a genetic that you

226
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,959
grow on the mainland you take it to Maui

227
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,759
and there's just a little bit something

228
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,859
different and special about the Hawaiian

229
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,379
Islands yeah absolutely I feel like you

230
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,080
can get that tropical

231
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:27,679
like floral bouquet from that that it

232
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,120
kind of takes you there like yeah yeah

233
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,159
or like we were saying earlier like

234
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,659
almost rotten papaya like when you're

235
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,579
walking through the jungle you can smell

236
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,919
the papaya trees because they'll drop

237
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,300
them and it's like alcoholic on the

238
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,879
ground but I was like this is like that

239
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,759
it's almost boiled it's almost sourced

240
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,559
you're like oh a couple more days of

241
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,740
this and you have to throw that away

242
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,379
right and then the flavor actually

243
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,899
translates from that flour that's right

244
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:56,879
so that's one thing we breed for you

245
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,458
know if it if it looks good and smells

246
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,740
good but then it only tastes okay you're

247
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:04,439
cut from the team and it's so common it

248
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,379
can't can't play that b grade you got to

249
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,300
have all three at least if not you know

250
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:11,039
it's got to look good it's got to smell

251
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:14,219
good and it's Gotta smoke like it smells

252
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,319
yeah just the three Basics yeah you know

253
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,080
now you can work on well I wanted to

254
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,540
yield or you know is it a is it

255
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,120
resilient or it depends on what you're

256
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:28,019
breeding for you know we're breeding for

257
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,060
straight nose and then we wait until a

258
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,860
month after it cures before we pull it

259
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,079
out and smoke it and test it so we still

260
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,539
have once we're done we still have tons

261
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,580
of work to do it's never done and we

262
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:40,860
have to go through and I know we have to

263
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,860
right I'll go through but we have 25

264
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:47,940
Finos of one strain so we have to smoke

265
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,579
all those and we did five strings so you

266
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,380
know there's a lot of smoking a lot of

267
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:54,439
smoking well and it's not just they're

268
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,240
smoking it's like strength critical

269
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,760
analysis this is of not just smoking

270
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,620
exactly paying attention to everything

271
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,319
that's going on and we ran into some

272
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,000
strains from the 26 I think I had to get

273
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,360
cut from the team just because I ran out

274
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,700
of room to hold genetics but they were

275
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,659
like not the tastiest didn't have the

276
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,660
osamine but I smoke 20 joints that day

277
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:22,379
and this was like the 19th 20th joint I

278
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:25,078
smoked and it opened up my lungs like I

279
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:28,439
had never experienced before it was just

280
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:30,958
like was the smoke wasn't hot it wasn't

281
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,579
harsh it didn't even feel like smoke in

282
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,578
my lungs I was just

283
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,000
yeah wow and you're like I already feel

284
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,160
like you have oxygen in your lungs it

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,620
was like something I want to hunt in it

286
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,319
again I still have seeds to go through

287
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,620
and and find that strain but this is a

288
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,720
medicine strain this is it's got uh if

289
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,480
you add water to it it bleeds out like

290
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,300
wine okay we're smoking a joint my

291
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,920
buddy's boat fishing and uh you know

292
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,199
it's windy and I got a plate and it's

293
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,299
messy so I toss it the wind blows it

294
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,040
back in the cabin you know we're walking

295
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,259
back and forth catching fish and then

296
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,059
next thing we look down at bleeding

297
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,338
purple throughout the whole floor of the

298
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,919
boat wow where every little speck hit

299
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,320
just from the salt water mixing with it

300
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,559
I've never I went and did some tests at

301
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,180
home on my own and just it's amazing I

302
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,119
have some on my Instagram where I just

303
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:29,039
broke up some seeds and then I had all

304
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,139
this stuff and I threw some water on it

305
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,000
and poured it through the plate and it

306
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,338
just started turning more like wine and

307
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,200
more and more purple and it was just

308
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,120
kind of just an amazing strain that has

309
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,399
a lot of different properties for

310
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,919
everyone at home what is that Instagram

311
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,440

327
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,879
it's more than just growing cannabis

00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,299
it's about growing your community your

really special time and absolutely I

334
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,539
really appreciate this opportunity to

335
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,219
sit down yeah I'm not surprised that it

336
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,838
happened here like this yeah I know

337
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,459
naturally yeah it's a perfect spot

338
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,160
we're three generations deep again A

339
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,838
Country Farm my kids are are really the

340
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,159
Legacy and they're the ones that are

341
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,740
going to be sitting here doing the next

342
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,259
interview well you know I'm on the farm

343
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,480
they're gonna take over this part but uh

344
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:05,759
it for now it's an honor being here and

345
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,519
and just loving the vibe here the roots

346
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,559
and back to the humble living you know

347
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,959
this is what brought us here is this

348
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,239
Market switch has been like a nightmare

349
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,518
in one way and an eye-opener in the

350
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,320
other of like where we are today and who

351
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,839
where do we want to be and this is where

352
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,940
we want to be this is why we came here

353
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,120
in the first place is that we have

354
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,180
Community we have great neighbors we

355
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,220
have food water we've got a clean living

356
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:35,039
we got a lifestyle that we still live no

357
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:38,399
matter what yeah you know it's just like

358
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,019
back to why are we here anyway we're

359
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,440
here because of the people we're with

360
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:47,100
we're here because of the atmosphere you

361
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,260
know and what it provides so we almost

362
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,259
couldn't do anything else anywhere else

363
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:54,059
no no I've where do I want to go is my

364
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:57,120
thought like okay this isn't working

365
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,278
like what what would I do if I didn't

366
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,459
live here and I

367
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:05,698
is there a better place to go and I'm

368
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,958
like no that's not I think that's what a

369
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,578
lot of us keep coming back to and

370
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,619
there's a lot of people leaving for you

371
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:12,500
know different pastors some people say

372
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,000
greener pastures I say different because

373
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,339
fast is always greener on the other side

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,940
of the hill but you know I think it's

375
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,199
very well said when you were mentioning

376
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,899
it it gives you a chance to kind of

377
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:27,059
reevaluate and reassert where you want

378
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,039
to be in life and follow that path so

379
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,500
yeah are you really dedicated to the

380
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,838
plant or are you really there for

381
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,019
certain reasons like maybe it's money

382
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,420
maybe it's who knows you know but it's

383
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,539
really comes down to like for me it's

384
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:44,639
back to my family and having that extra

385
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:47,278
time to take to be with them and then

386
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,339
the plant has always been number one for

387
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,500
us as well just as a family we we just

388
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:55,079
love doing what we do so we don't want

389
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,419
to stop doing it we want to we want to

390
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:00,000
create create great things for for

391
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:02,219
people to be just blown away at you know

392
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,778
we got 10 different strains that we're

393
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,720
just starting out with now and we're

394
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:09,360
doing all these crazy inner breeding

395
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,519
with them this year to come up with 100

396
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,379
different strains out of the 10 that we

397
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,720
have already and I love it that you're

398
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,120
not once have you mentioned or focused

399
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,800
on any of the like over hype streams

400
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,379
that everybody's talking about right now

401
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,778
all the genetics you're talking about

402
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:26,639
are relatively unique relatively unheard

403
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:28,620
of in the grander scheme of things and

404
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,440
people get stuck on all this hype [ __ ]

405
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,940
I've got to have this I gotta have what

406
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,860
this guy's doing I gotta have the thing

407
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,660
that I saw on the thing and you're just

408
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,579
like stick to your guns we know it's

409
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:42,838
always going to be hypesters out there

410
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:44,519
yes if you really are a conditioned

411
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,100
smoker you're going to be looking for

412
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,139
something else it's not like the college

413
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,000
kid that wants to go get drunk he's

414
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,879
gonna go get the cheapest beer you can

415
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,379
get it's like that THC High thing where

416
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna go in the

417
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:00,120
dispensary and get the cheapest highest

418
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,679
THC I can get well after a while you're

419
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,879
gonna get sick of that you're going to

420
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,099
win that you're going to learn about

421
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,359
wine you're going to learn about food

422
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:09,058
you're going to learn about different

423
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,698
kind of herb that you want to smoke

424
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,918
that's like you're graduating now you're

425
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,439
getting older you're getting more

426
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,640
experience with your cannabis

427
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,259
consumption and now you want something

428
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,660
different well we got something

429
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:24,058
different always we're always coming up

430
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,279
with something different so friends yeah

431
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:28,558
thanks that's not that we're not playing

432
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,480
The Hanger no doubt man well thanks for

433
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,819
bringing that uniqueness because that

434
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,640
hype [ __ ] comes out of people creating

435
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:37,500
with passion and all of a sudden people

436
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,940
start to discover it so you know I would

437
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,859
not be surprised to hear one of these

438
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,900
unique strains being the next type thing

439
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,899
that people are chasing from all over

440
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,600
the country yep so that is that's that's

441
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,120
the hope but we're also like keeping it

442
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,879
down home we want to be like if things

443
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,459
do happen here for us we would like to

444
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,700
be able to spread to our neighbors first

445
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,919
and help support them and then move on

446
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,440
from there and try and get it out but

447
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,780
we're really we're really trying to hold

448
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,720
on to our genetics and not get them out

449
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:12,599
right now just because we think that

450
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,240
having in-house genetics is is going to

451
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:17,339
be a good play later on to have the you

452
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,919
know exclusive genetics that you can't

453
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:22,918
find anywhere else that's grown in this

454
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,720
tear walk so I completely really trying

455
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,400
to keep it in the community first but

456
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,038
then get it to everybody at the same

457
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,780
time yeah that's so amazing dude thank
