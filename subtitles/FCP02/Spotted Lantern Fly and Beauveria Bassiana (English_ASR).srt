16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,519
you've been uh posting a bunch about

17
00:00:52,479 --> 00:01:01,000
spotted Lantern flies and then uh

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,400
Bavaria basana right yeah and and so can

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,359
can I just turn the mic over to you to

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,799
drop some knowledge on spotted Lantern

21
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,640
flies and the targeted Bavaria

22
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,840
basana yeah so I like to start out by

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,519
saying you know I'm not an entomologist

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm a self-taught myologist citizen

25
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,959
scientist um I discovered uh you know we

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,840
had Pennsylvania where I'm at is like

27
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,559
the epicenter of where the spot Lantern

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,280
fly pretty much C can you share my

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,920
screen how do I do that Jeff no no not

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,920
sorry not you uh there we

31
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,839
go yeah so anyways um yeah so we're

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
pretty much the epicenter of where the

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,560
spotted Lantern fly originated um here

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,600
in Pennsylvania so I've been kind of you

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,799
know I've seen basically the whole shock

36
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,399
wave of

37
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,399
infestation uh for the past four or five

38
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,920
years I'd say so um you know uh I think

39
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,399
like three years ago I was hiking and I

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,920
found uh land fly infested area that was

41
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,320
covered in this white fuzzy mold looking

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,679
substance and I knew right away that it

43
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,959
was a pathogenic fungus uh and that fact

44
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,360
that uh you know it's actually could be

45
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,239
high of value to me uh to to everybody

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,400
so I decided to keep the uh insect the

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,519
the specimen um I cultured it um just

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,080
did like a sterile swab on to water agar

49
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,480
and then expanded it out I also took

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,400
that one specimen I was able ble to just

51
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,799
swab the body of it and catch other

52
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,159
living healthy SP Lantern flies and with

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,800
that swab I was just able to you know

54
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,840
touch them on their on their face on

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,640
their body and then I would incubate

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,759
them in like a little uh like a little

57
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,759
hamster cage and with some moss and some

58
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:50,000
uh moisture in there and I would just

59
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,000
kind of ride it out and see what would

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,560
happen I was running a bunch of

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,840
experiments for a couple of years um I

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,598
took a break for two years uh the cage

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,680
still exists actually I have it right

64
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:04,399
here it's uh you know we're talking like

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,319
really you know uh him B simple science

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
type stuff here but like um yeah this

67
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,598
cage it's it's completely contaminated

68
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,120
with scores

69
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:15,280
from yeah can I ask a question did I

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
didn't hear you when you said hold that

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
up make them big and then have them hold

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,080
that up again I'm trying it won't let

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,080
let me see here I think if you

74
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,199
uh it's like having my uh three-year-old

75
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:32,680
on the controls all right right we're

76
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,318
getting close yes right now hold it back

77
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,680
up so I have a question real quick when

78
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:36,759
you said you touched them in different

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
spots you were talking about touching

80
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:42,560
them with Bava basana yeah so the the

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,560
specimen that I had I swabbed it and

82
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,280
then took a living specimens and a bunch

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,479
of them actually they were everywhere

84
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,158
swapped them incubated them in the in a

85
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,919
chamber and recorded the results and I

86
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:56,438
did that for a while and uh the results

87
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,000
were were actually really uh like

88
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,878
instantaneous I would say within hours

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,919
uh I was seeing um a decline in the

90
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,039
health of the living specimens in the

91
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:09,158
cage uh after after 24 hours they were

92
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,560
dead and then 48 Hours you had the uh

93
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:13,679
the fungus you know um growing out of

94
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,439
its

95
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,959
exoskeleton that's insane C can you hold

96
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,719
uh what you were holding up before

97
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,439
because you you were like thumb or stamp

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,199
size there go so this is my I call it my

99
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,600
uh Mia basana torture chamber for the

100
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,160
spot Lantern flies you actually see some

101
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,400
in there I'm incubating it's like the

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,360
Roman

103
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,198
Coliseum yeah yeah I put uh you know

104
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,840
moss in there um just to kind of

105
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,199
recreate like a natural environment uh

106
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,478
the the you know the spores everything

107
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,038
they like to lay dormant and like uh

108
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,839
dirt and and in the ground and stuff so

109
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:49,879
I take uh that that's actually that ju

110
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,319
Just quickly that's super cool that like

111
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:55,079
I mean on the negative side when you

112
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,839
have like septoria or other fungal

113
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:01,079
things it sucks to have it in your soil

114
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:03,918
but in this case it just lingers waiting

115
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,918
right yeah uh I took two years off just

116
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,639
to test the shelf life of the fungus um

117
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:10,560
for two years I didn't I didn't this

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,560
container sat there for two years dried

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,720
out uh dry cycle and then um just this

120
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,120
past like just a few weeks ago I started

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,560
the experiments again just to see if I

122
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,240
if I could re you know uh reinfect these

123
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,639
uh insects by with this cage and threw

124
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,160
them in there next day they're all like

125
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,600
sluggish or dead um the next day they

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
were growing like the very BOS like the

127
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,039
typical white filamentous mold coming

128
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,079
out of

129
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:38,879
them that that's insane when you go

130
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,318
ahead

131
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,038
Sor when you held up that stock or in

132
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,360
that video that that that that fungus

133
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,120
looking growth that was on the stock

134
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,199
were you saying that that was what

135
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,478
combats them or is that their babies the

136
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,400
lanternfly babies what do you mean I no

137
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,399
I think he's talking about those like

138
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,239
the

139
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:02,038
aphids there was video that fungus on

140
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,759
that do that was showing uh that here uh

141
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:07,759
m m make the the in make my shared

142
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,280
screen big again now I I think you're

143
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,680
talking about these guys which are

144
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:16,198
aphids right yeah okay yeah those are uh

145
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,360
actually went viral yeah those are

146
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,680
called woolly aphids um they are native

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,800
pest I believe uh that's they're on a

148
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,759
beach tree uh they can cause some

149
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,759
illness with American beach trees but uh

150
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,439
yeah they when they're Disturbed they uh

151
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,120
you know they flap they move around um

152
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,759
really just like that it's pretty cool

153
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,800
to see they I was talking about the

154
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,598
initial video that you put up but when

155
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,560
you first spotted the lantern flies the

156
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,719
very initial video there was a stick

157
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,199
with some stuff on the end there was

158
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,880
some growth on it you know what I'm

159
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,720
talking about um that right there what

160
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,000
is or is that a Q-tip that's just a

161
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,520
Q-tip never mind all right I'm sorry I'm

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,800
blind and dumb okay I'm catching up I'm

163
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,359
sorry it's all right I'm sorry yeah so

164
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,120
right there I'm swabbing the specimen so

165
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,919
uh say 24 48 hours ago I took an an

166
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
infected specimen that had all the

167
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,639
filamentous mle growing out of it for my

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,598
incubation torture chamber I took that I

169
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,079
took a spray bottle I threw that

170
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,478
infected dead specimen that had the

171
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,159
visible mole growing out of it into a

172
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,800
spray bottle with a little bit of water

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,120
switched it around you know just like

174
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,520
stirred it up and then went outside to

175
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,879
my maple tree where where they have been

176
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,799
congregating for the past five years uh

177
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,240
and I just started spraying uh you know

178
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,918
just reach able uh insects healthy

179
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,478
insects I went out uh this morning or

180
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,878
actually like midday today and found

181
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,478
these two specimens right here

182
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,759
underneath the tree with with I would

183
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:45,800
say maybe 50 or so dead or dying uh spot

184
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,000
Lantern flies that's and sorry this is

185
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,639
you you so you sprayed yesterday and

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,720
this was today yes that's essentially it

187
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,280
sounds kind of similar for lack of

188
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,720
better term or an education like a a

189
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:01,679
insect frass JMS or IMO kind of thing

190
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,360
did you add some sort of surfactant with

191
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,840
the spray or did you just go straight

192
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,400
with the the stuff just it was just

193
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,560
water and the insect the infected insect

194
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,079
just switched it up really good um like

195
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,079
I said it had mold grow it and then you

196
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,318
know that's that's just how you can

197
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:20,598
expand the culture and apply so so this

198
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,158
is your spray bottle here right yeah yep

199
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:25,680
yeah all there we go I mean I always

200
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:28,079
tell anyone who who grows uh you know uh

201
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,918
crops espe the canas industry if you

202
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,120
guys find in your grow especially in

203
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,439
your grow and it's a pest and you find

204
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,679
like a moldy insect you need to save

205
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,839
that specimen uh you should document you

206
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,399
should send to someone who knows how to

207
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
work with it because that could be

208
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,958
potential like some of the best uh you

209
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,399
know pest treatment for for instance

210
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,079
like you could you could do uh the

211
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,559
potential is is

212
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,440
there and so basically you're you're

213
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,759
taking your micology skill set you know

214
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,320
in terms of

215
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:01,120
like take Taking spores and saving them

216
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,160
and and making sure they don't get

217
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,360
contaminated and has anybody tried that

218
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,319
on Japanese

219
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,720
beetles so I would love to find H you

220
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,519
need to find the right strin you got to

221
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,800
find a Japanese Beetle that's infected

222
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,159
with the Bavaria basana uh you get lucky

223
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,958
uh you know like I was lucky enough to

224
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,919
find a spa Ln fly um and the way I keep

225
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,599
this culture alive is that at each year

226
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:26,199
I just inflect infect new specimens with

227
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,839
the spores the spores are what are most

228
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,278
uh you know they're like the deadly uh

229
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:35,320
the Fatal uh you know mortality of the

230
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,759
insect you what do you think about what

231
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,160
do you think about catching some

232
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,559
Japanese beetles and putting them in a

233
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,838
container and spraying them with the

234
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,439
shelf shelf B I have tried that with

235
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,640
that strain and nothing's happened so it

236
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,760
needs to be a specific species I've done

237
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,319
some other pollinator insects with this

238
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,919
strain of Bavaria basana and it hasn't

239
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,160
affected them and I was really worried

240
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,078
about pollinators getting affected by

241
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:01,319
that that that's awesome that you tested

242
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:01,319
that yeah I'm a beekeeper so you know

243
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,440
collateral damage how do you how do you

244
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,919
find out for sure and I'm asking because

245
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
I don't I truly don't know how do you

246
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,879
find out for sure that it's B Vera

247
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,799
basana that is what that that's SP

248
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,759
that's coming out how like is there and

249
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:21,519
are there many species of boua basana or

250
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,958
is it some like like does that question

251
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,679
make sense for what we know it's it's

252
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:28,119
just different strains of it some are

253
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,719
more selective at host or their host

254
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,240
insects um some are a lot more broad too

255
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,680
um like you can get multiple species I

256
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,959
mean I think most of Bavaria bosana this

257
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,359
is just me I don't know this for sure I

258
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:42,719
think uh the Bavaria basana spores that

259
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,039
you can get for uh you know uh

260
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,680
remediation of of pests and stuff I'm

261
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,838
sure it's multiple different strains

262
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,039
combined together um but don't quote me

263
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,000
on that that's just what would make

264
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,199
sense to me because they're so selective

265
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,639
um to their hosts wh well what's

266
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,399
interesting is when I saw your post that

267
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:00,919
was kind of the first time I even

268
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,440
thought about the fact that there are

269
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:07,838
different strains of Bavaria basana and

270
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,680
it's not just all one strain and and so

271
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,360
so you you've tested this on a bunch of

272
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,919
different insects and you found that the

273
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,720
only one it works on is the spotted

274
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,439
Lantern fly this particular strain as

275
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,680
far as I know I probably tested about 15

276
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,680
or 20 different you know Common

277
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,599
important insects that I would feel hey

278
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,559
may might not be good or that one needs

279
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,720
to go like Japanese beetle I tested on

280
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,958
Japanese beetle uh didn't have any luck

281
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,680
it didn't infect them they're fine so

282
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,638
it's it's definitely complex like

283
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,759
there's there's a lot that I don't know

284
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,480
sure that know a lot more than I do but

285
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,958
uh it's fascinating now I mean h have

286
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,278
you talked to any but like I besides you

287
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:49,599
I know no one

288
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:53,278
who has found the targeted uh spotted

289
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,839
Lantern fly Bavaria basana yeah no I

290
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,159
have sent a few years ago I know um a

291
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,120
bunch of people in the mological

292
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:03,078
community who study and specialize in

293
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,278
parasitic fungi like Corps and other

294
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:07,879
different species and Bavaria basana and

295
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,838
uh that's that's what they specialize in

296
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,078
I sent them the culture a couple years

297
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,120
ago I'm like here here's you you know I

298
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,638
know you're you're going to do good

299
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,799
things with it I want you to study it

300
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,399
for me too like you know we all come

301
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,240
together on information that's what we

302
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,440
did and we're all in the general same

303
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,680
consensus of of what we're working

304
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,720
with well it it's like the caterpillar

305
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:34,278
uh you know in inside Canada's

306
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,079
right yeah I think there's a I'm not

307
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,320
quite sure the name scientific name but

308
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:42,278
there is a fungus bacteria I want to say

309
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,600
th Genesis that helps with that um I

310
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,399
don't know if it's Bavaria I think

311
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,959
there's strains of Bavaria that do help

312
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,360
I think it's basilis thuringensis right

313
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,159
that's what it is that's exactly what it

314
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,079
is B yeah

315
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,759
yeah it it is mindblowing that just I

316
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,000
mean it's kind well it's kind of like

317
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,838
human diseases right like like uh yeah

318
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,159
or like the bird flu right like

319
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,120
something that sticks with one species

320
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,240
sometimes they jump yep those are

321
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,679
spotted Lantern flag yeah they

322
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,959
are so my thinking is maybe like what

323
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:18,799
you're what you're doing could be

324
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:21,919
similar to like making a

325
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:24,759
jam yeah I

326
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:28,000
mean the application could just be as

327
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:29,919
simple as instead of fermenting it and

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,759
and like

329
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,759
if you ever had a chance would would you

330
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,399
consider making a um a non microbial

331
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,958
solution with some worm castings or

332
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,278
something like that and seeing if you

333
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,719
could touch a few of them with that and

334
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,919
see if it has a similar effect just to

335
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,440
see maybe the Thea might be might be

336
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:50,039
coming out of the

337
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,600
soil here or or like I I don't know I'm

338
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,399
it's ignor sorry for the ignorance of my

339
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,959
question I'm wondering though is that no

340
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,720
the most effective way that you're going

341
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:00,198
to make the very bosana work for you is

342
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,639
if you take the spores and add them to

343
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:04,399
like your folar sprays and just apply it

344
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,919
with like water you can you could put it

345
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,639
with with like whatever other uh micro

346
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:11,039
Solutions you want to add while you're

347
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,639
spraying but as long as those spores are

348
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,879
there and they're hitting the insects

349
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,959
that's what's going to cause uh you know

350
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,159
termination of whatever it's whatever

351
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,159
you're

352
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,720
targeting I've done some research on uh

353
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,680
living melium uh I've taken spot Lanter

354
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,079
fli

355
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,359
and put that on a plate of colonized

356
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,120
plate of my celium and uh you know I put

357
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,240
them on there they came in contact with

358
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,198
it uh and it didn't really do much I

359
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,919
mean I had really low uh fatality rate U

360
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,838
but when I exposed it to just like a

361
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,360
swab of some spores um they're within

362
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,320
hours you're starting to see them get

363
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,560
sluggish uh and then they're dead within

364
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,000
24 hours and then they're they've uh you

365
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:59,399
know the mold the fungus is exposed to

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,278
their excess skeleton

367
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,919
that's no I mean interesting like like

368
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:07,958
if I mean if you think about how kind of

369
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:11,159
there's a public effort

370
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:13,559
to eliminate them before they kind of

371
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:16,120
get to like Japanese beetle out of

372
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,638
control I mean this is huge

373
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,919
right sorry you got a little laggy there

374
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,560
I didn't catch that question sorry I I

375
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,679
said I said given that there's like a

376
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:30,198
public effort

377
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:33,758
to prevent spotted Lantern flies from

378
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:37,399
from becoming a like invasive species on

379
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,278
the level of Japanese Beatles or like uh

380
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,318
what What's the carp that's coming up to

381
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,318
Mississippi Asian the the Asian carp or

382
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:49,078
uh like you know

383
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:52,599
it like have you run this by people who

384
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,958
are kind of at the government level

385
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,720
trying

386
00:15:53,958 --> 00:16:00,399
to eliminate them I mean I was I was in

387
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,319
contact there was a few years ago um I

388
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,720
think Penn State did a study on a bavar

389
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,799
basana strain that was effective uh you

390
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,000
can look at those results um you can you

391
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,799
can look them up their public results

392
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,958
you can look into that and what they

393
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,919
what they found and everything uh by the

394
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,719
time I found it spe started working with

395
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:20,639
it someone direct me to this guy at

396
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,519
Cornell University was doing a write up

397
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
by then by the time I got in contact

398
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:26,399
with him he was he'd already finished

399
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,000
his write up so um I missed the vote on

400
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,078
that one but um no I mean from what I've

401
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,240
seen for the past five six years uh the

402
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,159
populations of spot Lantern flies in my

403
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,240
area like I said I was in the epicenter

404
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,759
of where the invasion started um the the

405
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,480
you could even walk in your backyard

406
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,800
without one flying in your mouth like it

407
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,440
was it was pretty thick uh The Invasion

408
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,639
um but I haven't noticed a whole lot of

409
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,759
crop damage like the uh they said it was

410
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,440
going to destroy a bunch of crops like

411
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,159
like grapes and um all these things and

412
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,639
like I have a great find I have Hops uh

413
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:02,198
that grow on my property I haven't

414
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,439
noticed any physical damage except for

415
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:07,119
the damage of the invasive tree of

416
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,519
Heaven um that that you know grows here

417
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,159
it's actually it comes from their part

418
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,078
of the world from Asia so they've killed

419
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,400
pretty much all the invasive trees in

420
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,078
the area which is which is pretty unique

421
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,600
you know it's actually had some good

422
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,399
outcomes from this Invasion so I mean we

423
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,958
have like barely any tree of Heaven

424
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,798
anymore uh the the um the numbers are

425
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,400
are declining uh immensely uh since they

426
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:33,000
started uh I mean we have invasive uh

427
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,679
insects like pre Manis Asian pre Manis

428
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,400
that love to eat them you know and I

429
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,000
think our natural uh insects and and

430
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,640
predators here are actually starting to

431
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
kind of see them as a meal um you know I

432
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,280
think the numbers have just declined

433
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,919
naturally I've witnessed um diseases uh

434
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,918
with with spot Lantern fly uh like

435
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,960
deformed Wing diseases that that they've

436
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,159
had um so I think they've had a lot of

437
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,200
challenges just by naturally showing up

438
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:00,640
here exploding in population but then

439
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,080
getting you know leveled back down by

440
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,120
just natural just just the balance you

441
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:08,199
know that's

442
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,678
what that's in that's interesting

443
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:15,200
because I mean obviously the the public

444
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:17,640
kind of dialogue is around like we need

445
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,919
to get them under control I I think what

446
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,360
what I'm hearing from you is the initial

447
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,559
freak out was probably just because we

448
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,038
didn't

449
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:28,319
know what they would do and your

450
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,720
anecdotal evidence of just what you're

451
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,798
seeing is like they're not targeting

452
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,880
stuff that's native they're not

453
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:38,079
targeting cash crops they're mostly

454
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,480
targeting the stuff from where they're

455
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:44,079
from that is invasive here oh yeah they

456
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,079
have uh many predators but I think that

457
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,798
number is is inclining I think they're

458
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,918
having a lot more Predators now

459
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:51,759
especially other invasive Predators but

460
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,720
for the most part I haven't seen any

461
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,798
actual physical damage on the crops that

462
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,319
they said that they were actually going

463
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,960
to go after um so you know in my opinion

464
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,480
I don't think it was as bad as they said

465
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,480
it was going to

466
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,960
be yeah that that's I mean th this is

467
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,038
all I thought you looking at your posts

468
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,120
and then also your kind of comments

469
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:18,919
about just they're not that bad from

470
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:21,879
your uh encounters with them was all

471
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:24,159
kind of I I don't know sounded all

472
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,960
interesting I find it super interesting

473
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,919
too that tracks that track two things

474
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,840
firstly that makes my mind Cur curiously

475
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,400
Wonder like is B basana popping up in

476
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:38,879
the jmss mixes and things like this and

477
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,559
then also the Jadon book offers a

478
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,400
specific Solution that's very similar

479
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:46,839
along the lines of what you're doing you

480
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,880
know it's you know but has a ree so

481
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:52,199
they're obviously controllable like what

482
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,039
I agree with you the hype it's

483
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,679
interesting the way you took a look at

484
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:57,158
it and say hey maybe they're just going

485
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,600
to get the invasive species maybe

486
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,360
they're not a big deal maybe somebody's

487
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,759
pumping some funding for some [ __ ]

488
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,038
somewhere it shouldn't go or some

489
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,240
interest somewhere it shouldn't go it's

490
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:09,519
interesting brings up a lot of

491

507
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,960
un there you go that's it yep

508
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,038
yeah you get two get two sport swabs and

509
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,000
like I said if you're a myologist you

510
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:09,759
have this invasive species and you want

511
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,798
to play around with it and do some

512
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,200
research and add to the data pool um

513
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,240
which is what I want to get done here is

514
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,240
just add to the data pool I have these

515
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,278
swabs and like I said you can just take

516
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,278
a living spot Lantern fly take that swab

517
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:25,480
and just rub it on its face and then

518
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:27,278
incubate it and then it should it should

519
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,440
kill it and then you'll have a specimen

520
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:32,480
to work with that continue you can

521
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,278
continue to keep that culture rolling as

522
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,960
long as you have specimens to keep you

523
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:37,440
know feeding it you know what I mean

524
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,919
then you can have and you get a whole

525
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,798
bunch of these you infect a whole bunch

526
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,520
of these and you take the whole bunch of

527
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,079
them you throw them in a spray bottle

528
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,038
and you can applicate you know a a

529
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,918
solution to to you know kill whatever is

530
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:52,240
in your backyard or on your trees or

531
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,278
whatever um that's you could inul you

532
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,839
could inoculate your living soil beds

533
00:21:54,278 --> 00:22:01,359
with it as well and things like that it

534
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:04,399
does it it will it'll it will the soil

535
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,839
yep that that yeah that's also mind blow

536
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,559
I mean just the way kind of spores work

537
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:10,558
in the sense that they can just be

538
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,960
dormant like I mean you said it was bone

539
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:17,720
dry for two years and

540
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,720
yep and then came

541
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:26,158
back yeah now that's cool I mean I I

542
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:29,200
think you know again uh BT for

543

Caterpillar super targeted

544
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,840

546
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,519

548
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,679
