prologue

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,039
during my travels in Thailand from 1981

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,899
to 1983. I fell in love with Thai

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,820
culture and Thai music

20
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,618
at some point I realized the sound of

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,019
the female Thai voice had a captivating

22
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,760
quality about it not only in song But

23
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,319
even in speech

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,240
it was something about the way Thai

25
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:16,879
women emphasize tones differently than

26
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,879
taiman which made their voices Musical

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,159
in 1985 I joined the Navy when I needed

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,180
a job in the Colombian weed business had

29
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,118
dried up

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,600
by 1987 I was working as an avionics

31
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,700
technician on four h-46 C Knight

32
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,500
helicopters at the search and rescue

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,100
division of the Naval Air Station Point

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,019
Magoo known as SAR Hilo

35
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,319
this story takes place while I was in

36
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,319
the Navy

38
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,158
spring 1987.

39
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,680
I was jogging around the half mile track

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,840
at Naval Air Station Point Magoo looking

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,659
at the radar Towers on the hill and

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,239
thinking what a beautiful day

43
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,759
it was a clear spring day and the sky

44
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,180
was Azure blue with fluffy white cotton

45
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,679
ball clouds dotting the sky

46
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,379
the night before I had been talking

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,879
about my idea for a band was my good

48
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,620
friend Kenny Miller

49
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,419
the band would have Thai female

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,759
background singers

51
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,378
and it would be a blend of cultures a

52
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,318
yin yang band

53
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,939
with American guys and Thai girls

54
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,518
we were thinking of what to call the

55
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,159
band we both laughed as Kenny threw out

56
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,959
the name soy cowboy

57
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,598
it was a pun on the name of a side

58
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,640
street off of sukumvit Road in Bangkok

59
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,359
that happened to have a bunch of go-go

60
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,359
bars on it

61
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,219
f-14s were using afterburners to launch

62
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,019
themselves Skyward in one of our

64
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,099
the Tsar Hilo hangar

65
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,780
a few more laps around the track and I

66
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,878
remembered hearing a jazz version of

67
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,280
Johnny Mercer's old Cowhand from the Rio

68
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:21,658

on KCRW

71
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,459
I knew the song from The Dan Hicks in

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,379
his Hot Licks album striking it rich

73
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,360
and then it hit me

74
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,340
old Calhan from the Rio Grande would be

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,319
soy Cowboys first song

76
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,259
the vision popped into my head fully

77
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,859
formed and somehow I knew it would come

78
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:42,859
to fruition

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,299
[Music]

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
back at the barracks I showered put my

81
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,500
work uniform on and drove over to the

82
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:55,798
SAR Hangar and removed and replaced an

83
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,560
iff box on bloodhound 14.

84
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,379
Bloodhound was the call sign for our SAR

86
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:06,598
after filling out the maintenance action

87
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,219
form I got Senior Chief Don osheline to

88
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,399
sign off on the job and he checked my

89
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:12,840
toolbox all tools accounted for and I

90
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,360
was out of there

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,639
it was Friday and I hopped in my VW ban

92
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,239
and drove off the base and hopped on the

93
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,239
101.

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,120
when I got to my mom's house in Encino I

95
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,339
called Tim long who had been the bass

96
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,300
player and fellow collaborator and a few

97
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,299
bands I had been in

98
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,660
I told Tim what I wanted to do he said

99
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,819
he was down with the idea and knew an

100
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,939
engineer we could hire who also played

101
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:51,000
drums his name was Joe remerson

102
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:53,639
I asked him if Joe was tall he said yes

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,100
I told Tim I knew Joe briefly from North

104
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,019
Hollywood High School

105
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,080
the next part of the puzzle was where to

106
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:03,000
find a Thai girl to sing on the tracks

107
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,519
I drove over to Tim's house in Studio

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,620
City which is up a driveway that went

109
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,299
South from Ventura Boulevard

110
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,959
Tim was subletting the place from

111
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,478
Charles polacek AKA Chaz whereas he

112
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,918
became known on stage Wade Charles the

113
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:19,258
23rd

114
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,240
Chaz lived in the unit above Tim's and

115
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,720
was a talented guitar player who had

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,340
been in a few bands with Tim and I

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,139
we were up in chaz's apartment

118
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,299
overlooking the valley below and I gave

119
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,620
them a fully inspired pep talk about my

120
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,199
idea

121
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,439
they were mesmerized beautiful Thai

122
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,478
girls in a band sounded great on paper

123
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,000
after a while the spell wore off and

124
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,159
Chas became non-committal

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,019
even with Chaz on the fence Tim and I

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,180
still had to find at least one Thai girl

127
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:51,000
to sing on the recording and so we

128
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,860
embarked on a talent scouting mission

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,800
we started frequenting Thai restaurants

130
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,020
and talking to Thai girls

131
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,520
most of them were amused by the idea but

132
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:01,740
couldn't sing

133
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,978
finally after count Miss pad Thai's and

134
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,500
singhas later we found a girl her name

135
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:11,699
was Ari she was a pretty girl with a bob

136
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:15,000
cut and she looked great in a cowboy hat

137
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:19,160
we found her at chitlada West the Thai

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:26,540
restaurant right below Tim and chaz's

139

[Music]

140
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,919
I borrowed fifteen hundred dollars from

141
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,079
the Navy Credit Union and we arranged a

142
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,758
date for the recording with Joe

143
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,399
he booked a little back house Studio

144
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,020
behind a house just south of Wilshire in

145
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,779
Beverly Hills

146
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:45,299
the studio is called the cottage it was

147
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:47,879
small but had a great Vibe it was in a

148
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,100
lush backyard shaded by jacaranda trees

149
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,500
and the interior was wood paneled with

150
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,840
comfy chairs and a couch

151
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,079
on a Saturday morning in late spring of

152
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,899
87 we recorded the Rhythm tracks Tim

153
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,180
played bass and acoustic guitar Joe had

154
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:05,159
the drums programmed and I put down the

155
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,620
piano track

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,660
in the afternoon Arie arrived with her

157
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,660
husband and we started knocking out her

158
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,660
yippee-i-o-kayes

159
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:21,000
[Music]

160
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,620
then we asked her to compose some Thai

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,959
lyrics to go along with the end of the

162
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,340
song and while she was doing that I

163
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,859
played a keyboard slide on a Yamaha DX7

164
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:34,978
I nailed it in one take

165
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,960
by then Ari had come up with the lyrics

166
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:37,859
she did a great job for being on the

167
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,620
spot

168
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,038
my favorite line translated to

169
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:47,060
Old Uncle Cowboy stay a while come

00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:49,560
listen to a song and play some music

171
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,439
Marie sang her lyrics and then recorded

172
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,300
the spoken word at the end of the tune

173
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,478
and then we realized we had no lead

174
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,240
vocals so all three of us Tim Joe and

175
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,459
myself recorded a lead vocal

176
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,918
I had Joe put a rough mix of all three

177
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,659
vocals on a cassette and Tim and I took

178
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,519
it to my mom's house

179
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,139
I knew right away that Joe was the lead

180
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,779
singer from the moment I heard him put

181
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,160
down his vocal but to keep things fair I

182
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,559
had my mom pick

183
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,900
Virginia had been in Show Business and

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,740
was unquestionably qualified to make the

185
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,538
choice

186
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,180
she listened to all three versions and

187
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:26,339
picked Joe's vocal without hesitation

188
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,240
and that's how Joe remissa got his first

189
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,239
lead singer gig

190
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,060
we finished the lead vocals and mixing

191
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,158
back at the college a week later

192
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,899
Joe's vocal had an element of humor and

193
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,658
playfulness which later manifested

194
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:45,059
itself in his stage persona

195
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,799
after recording the song we scheduled a

196
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,199
promo photo session at my mom's house

197
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,319
and shot a few Polaroids with all of us

198
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,420
wearing cowboy hats

199
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,640
later that week on Friday I typed an

200
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,740
introductory letter to Tom Schnabel and

201
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,000
drove to Santa Monica with the letter a

202
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,000
Polaroid and a cassette

203
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,240
KCRW was in a basement on the campus of

204
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,240
Santa Monica City College

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,379
I walked in and asked to talk to Tom

206
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,060
Schnabel he wasn't there but an

207
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:20,100
assistant showed me where his desk was

208
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,838
and said I could leave the promo pack

209
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,820
there

210
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,440
I neatly arranged the letter in the

211
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,540
middle of the desk and put the Polaroid

212
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,339
in the center of the letter waited the

213
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,338
down with the cassette and drove home

214

[Music]

215
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,259
the next night I was celebrating with

216
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,219
Kenny Miller who had just taken the bar

217
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:46,319
exam

218
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,660
we were in his hotel room in Pasadena

219
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,220
and the phone rings and it's my mom

220
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,500
telling me she just got off the phone

221
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,720
with Tom Schnabel and he was planning to

222
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,299
play Old Callahan on Morning Becomes

223
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,480
Eclectic that next Monday

224
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:02,039
that Monday Tom played the song

225
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,440
that was great

226
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,419
and then a few months passed and I was

227
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,640
talking to Kenny Miller and he said

228
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:10,620
what's happening with soy Cowboy you

229
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,860
seem to have dropped the ball

230
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,720
that hit hard

231
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,180
it was a Monday and I was at Sick Bay on

232
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,040
base at NAS Point of View getting some

233
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,958
dental work done

234
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,659
I picked up the phone in the hall and

235
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,159
called KCRW and asked to speak to Thomas

236
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:28,740
Schnabel

237
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,139
Tom got on the phone and I told him who

238
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,959
I was and right away he was asking me to

239
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,699
bring the band in for a live performance

240
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,838
I said sure but I need a couple of

241
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,420
months

242
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,459
he put me on the phone with Ariana

243
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:43,439
Morgenstern his producer and we set a

244
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,778
date for the show

245
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,860
okay so I got us a gig but there was no

246
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,899
band

247
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,379
we had made one recording of one song

248
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:57,110
and now we're going to play KCRW live

249
00:10:52,379 --> 00:11:03,899
the big question was who was we

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:05,759
[Music]

251
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,019
I called Tim and Joe and they agreed to

252
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,059
do the show

253
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:10,860
we were able to talk Chaz into playing

254
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,199
guitar as well

255
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,278
she would program the drums on his drum

256
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,140
machine

257
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,620
and we needed to find a few more Thai

258
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,620
singers

259
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,519
Tim and I were back Talent scouting for

260
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,579
female Thai vocalists

261
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,139
LA and in particular Hollywood had a few

262
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:30,359
upscale Thai restaurants with

263
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,919
good-looking waitresses but could any

264
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,899
sing and did they want to be in the

265
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:38,000
world's first High Western band

266
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,000
a term later coined by Schnabel himself

00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:49,019
Larchmont kawanga and Pico Boulevard

269
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:51,659
we visited Tommy tanks on Melrose gelato

270

West blows apartment on Ventura

271
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:54,899
which has its own little story for

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,419
another time

273
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,278
Thai Town further down Melrose and a

274
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,740
restaurant next to Jumbo's Clown Room on

275
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,139
Hollywood Boulevard east of Western

276
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,200
can't remember its name but it is now

00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,419
called krung Ted

278
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,879
we found a willing waitress at Chandra

279
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:14,278
on Larchmont named Tumi talbotom

280

radiant smile

284
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,120
we found an actual singer at Thai Town

285
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:28,199
on Melrose Thai Town catered to ties

286
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,299
mostly and had live time music nightly

287
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,940
singers mostly female were accompanied

288
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:36,199
by a Cheesy organ played by a Thai guy

289
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,820
with a drum machine

290
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,519
one Friday night during this time after

291
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,200
driving into town from Point Mugu Kenny

292

Town while eating

294
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,199
the singer was singing traditional and

295
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,240
popular Thai love songs

westernized pop

restaurant that wasn't watching her

300
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,209
Kenny was mesmerized and he said I'd

301
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,159
marry her

talked to the singer candy manacy was

305
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,539
the name she went by

306
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,539
and she said she'd give it a try

307
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:19,500

and candy

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,278
meanwhile I had rented a small room in a

310
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,679
house in Sherman Oaks that I would use

311
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,419
on the weekends from a friend of Kenny's

312
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,399
whose name eludes me

313
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,319
the house had a piano in the living room

314
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,578
and no one was ever there except me

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,440
nightmare and during the six year life

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,480
of the band's first Incarnation it never

00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:34,159

339
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,159
everybody there

340
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:41,159
in mom's garage we worked on Old Cowhand

341
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,500
and a new song called Lily pants

342
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,958
we threw in a Marty Robbins song Saddle

343
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,339
[ __ ] and another newly Written song

344
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,338
Back at the grace Hotel

345
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,139
to do the KCRW show I had to get

346
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,419
permission to take the day off from my

347
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:59,459
immediate commanding officer Senior

348
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,559
Chief Don ocheline

349
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,599
a very cool supervisor who helped me

350
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,119
with difficult jobs let me read him

351
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,220
essays and who was also an avionics

352
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,778
technician

353
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,120
I looked at the reason for the request

354
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,939
and approved it laughing in his unique

355
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,578
and ironic way

356
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,000
thank you

357
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:22,799
the day came we played KCRW

358
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,078
the show was Tom schnabel's Morning

359
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,059
Becomes Eclectic and you had to get

360
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,819
there early in the morning and the band

361
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,919
easily checked the eclectic box

362
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,839
everyone was nervous

363
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,939
this was our first gig and we would be

364
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,680
live on the radio

365
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,620
we dragged our equipment down into the

366
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,620
KCRW basement located in a building on

367
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,139
the campus of Santa Monica City College

368
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,320
Tom introduced himself and his producer

369
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,060
Ariana to the band as well as the

370
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,040
engineer Jeff

371
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,679
we set up in the studio and it was a bit

372
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,659
cramped with cables running everywhere

373
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,939
it was Showtime

374
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:03,000
Tom started talking about cassettes that

375
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,220
he had received and

376
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,679
and now here's the recording of soy

377
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,160
Cowboys first ever gig and the first of

378
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:15,059
many KCRW shows

379
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:17,879
courtesy of Vince nicoletti and I

380
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:21,539
put it into the machine and I listened

381
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:23,698
to it we receive a lot of cassette tapes

382
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:26,399
um most of them not really solicited

383
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:29,698
that we hardly have a chance to listen

384
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,778
to being an Eclectic station with a wide

385
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:39,000
format we get tapes in all shapes sizes

386
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:43,019
colors styles from uh real B grade stuff

387
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,100
to occasionally and a very sort of not

388
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,539
that often really something really good

389
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,180
Vince nicoletti's

390
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:52,980
tape and music was one of the good ones

391
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,979
and certainly one of the most unusual

392
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,860
ones that we've gotten

393
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,920
for one thing it mixes country and

394
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,500
western music with Thai vocals so

395
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:08,519
without further Ado I'd like to welcome

396
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,480

399
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,838
little bit up there so we can hear

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,660
everybody talking I would like you uh

401
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,938
first of all to uh

402
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,100

404
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,019
members before we get going well

405
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,200
to do actually

406
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,819
two parts of my soul into some music I

407
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,220
went to Thailand and fell in love with

408
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:43,500
the culture and the people and when I

409
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,140
came back here you know I left part of

410
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,880
my heart there so uh I decided that I

411
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,179
could put it together in this little

412
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,400
project here so that's what I've done in

413
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,280
I've gathered together a great bunch of

414
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,160
people here and we have a great time

415
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:01,139

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,600
kind of music that we like as well so

417
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:08,720

418
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,719
wacko and uh he's a he's aware of it

a chili dog and that's when I found her

epilogue to this day Tim Joe and Chaz

638
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,200
are some of my closest friends without

639
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:09,239
their help and talent I never would have

640
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,879
been able to pull it off

641
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:13,259
sometime after the show Tom mentioned

642
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,180
the high production value on the

643
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,800
recording which was due to Joe's

644
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,838
engineering

645
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,420
Tom Schnabel and I became good friends

646
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:23,279
and still are and while I always tried

647
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,440
to get Joe to go back to Thailand with

648
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,740
me it was Tom who ended up on that

649
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,619
Adventure a few years later

650
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:34,139
from that first show on KCRW silly

651
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,119
Cowboy found a video director cool gigs

652
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:37,078
and La clubs and eventually a record

653
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,780
deal

654
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,359
but first I had to deal with the US Navy

655
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,760
and it was inevitable that over the

656
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,858
band's first six years some of the guys

657
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,940
would end up with some of the girls

658
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:53,159
which can be a recipe for disaster

659
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,679
we eventually got a real drummer

660
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,078
none other than Brian glasscock a truly

661
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,699
lovable Englishman who had been in the

662
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,460
motels

663
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:04,460
I nicknamed him phallus cristalis

664
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,899
there were eight girls in the six year

665
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,820
life of our first go-round with soy

666
