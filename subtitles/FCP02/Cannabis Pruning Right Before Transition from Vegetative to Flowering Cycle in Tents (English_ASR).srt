[Music]

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,718
okay so today what we're going to do

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,000
is i'm going to show you how i will

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,518
prepare this plant

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,800
to move it from veg into flower and what

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,199
i mean by prepare

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
is taking off some of the lower branches

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,240
taking off some of the side

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
shoots and really trying to send as much

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,679
energy

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,519
up to the top of the plant but also

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,920
account for the stretch

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,399
because this thing is going to stretch a

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
lot and i know some of these lower limbs

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,239
they'll never see the light and nobody

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,399
likes trimming larf

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,640
so we're going to take it off we're

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,640
going to send energy up to the top

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
and we're going to avoid trimming larf

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,280
so win-win for everybody

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,359
that is kind of a simplified answer well

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,198
that is a simplified answer to

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,799
the overall theme of what we're doing

24
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,599
here there's a lot of

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,000
hormonal interactions within the plant

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,280
when you

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,400
remove leaves when you remove branches

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
redistribution of hormones and auxins it

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
causes

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
further growth side branching a lot a

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,559
lot of different things but

32
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,118
you don't necessarily need to concern

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
yourself with that pretty much

34
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,400
this is something that you're going to

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
want to do because of lack of light

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,118
penetration

37
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,599
and again i probably go a little bit

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,759
heavier because my tent is so tight

39
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,599
i have things budding up against each

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,478
other and there's not a lot of room for

41
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,478
diffused light to come in from the side

42
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,759
but again i grew the skunk number one

43
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,679
last time and it

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,680
super stretched on me so i know i'm

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,479
gonna have about a two or three time

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,520
stretch

47
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:44,560
pretty much anything from here below

48
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,599
can be taken off because after all of

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,439
this stretches

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:53,359
i've got one two three four

51
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,679
and five main terminal shoots on here

52
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,759
uh there's some down here but again

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,000
those are never gonna see the light

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
once everything else stretches so i'm

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,718
gonna get rid of them

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,399
i'm gonna bring their energy up and

57
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,840
no larf to trim all right let's go in

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,840
for a closer look

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,360
so what i've done just as a visual

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,439
reference for everybody

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,640
is i've attached a twist tie it goes

62
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,759
along through

63
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,679
the plant here at this level

64
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,120
we'll kind of pan down now you see it

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,599
there still at the top

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,439
you see the bottom of my pot you see

67
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,199
that line that i've drawn

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,359
we're going to leave it right there and

69
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,119
i'm going to do a little chopping

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,440
all right we'll start with the easy

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,159
stuff as i said before i've got my line

72
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,239
in here

73
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,840
everything down is probably going to go

74
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,280
because it won't reach the light

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,039
that doesn't mean i'm going to chop this

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
branch off down there there's still

77
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,878
plenty of it

78
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,159
above the line but this branch good

79
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,479
healthy looking branch

80
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,840
plenty of side shoots it's something

81
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,840
that's going to grow bud

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,360
and as a new grower one of the harder

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,319
things to do is to chop

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,920
something that's going to grow bud but

85
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,839
trust me you don't want the bud from

86
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,958
there it's going to be loafy

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,560
very airy non-desirable is what that

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,239
means

89
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,158
but it's not going to get enough light

90
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,480
so i'm going to take my clippers

91
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:17,439
which are sterilized before each plant

92
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,840
i'm just going to take it off right at

93
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,840
the stem

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,840
oh my goodness it looks naked but that's

95
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,560
okay

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,239
now i will say if you're like me and you

97
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,719
run a perpetual harvest

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,599
and you don't keep mothers but you do do

99
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,239
clones

100
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,598
this is a great time to take your clones

101
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,200
when you're cleaning your plant up

102
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,679
getting ready for flower

103
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,639
you have lots of these awesome side

104
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,920
shoots

105
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,958
these if you cut it right you strip it

106
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,079
down

107
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,439
makes an excellent clone so this is a

108
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,760
great time to do that

109
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,199
but again here's another branch it's

110
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,679
never gonna reach when it has the uh

111
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,518
proper stretch on the top so we don't

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,480
need it we're gonna get rid of it

113
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,519
there's that big fan leafs we don't need

114
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,318
them

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,319
get rid of that

116
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:14,560
okay so we run into a situation now

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,199
where we have stuff below

118
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,079
the line still let's get closer in on

119
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,040
this and you'll see

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,040
how i approach this and cut them so

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
again there's a lot of ways to do this

122
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,479
process there's a lot of factors from

123
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
the amount of

124
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,000
foliation on the plant whether you strip

125
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,399
off a lot of the leaves

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
this plant not very leafly i don't need

127
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,239
to do that

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,839
but also the lights that you're using

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,800
and the amount of penetration that the

130
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,119
light gets

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,478
that's very important for how deep it's

132
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,199
going to go through

133
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,639
your canopy and i tend to run a pretty

134
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,319
tight setup like i said

135
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,918
so there's not a lot of light coming in

136
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,800
from the sides so i'm going to clean up

137
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,240
this stuff

138
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,478
and i'm just going to start doing that

139
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,960
now again i've got my line

140
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,800
in through here that will give you guys

141
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,599
again that visual reference

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,478
so when i'm doing this i always just

143
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,240
kind of cut it

144
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,519
can go in here i can even take that leaf

145
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,918
off i just cut it

146
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,319
and again if you wanted to make a clone

147
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:13,519
you've got a great clone right here so

148
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,800
good time to do it but uh i do not like

149
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,399
trimming larf

150
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,199
so i go pretty heavy i have no mercy for

151
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,239
these

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,800
lower branches because i know with the

153
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
stretch

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,560
that they are just not going to reach

155
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
they're not going to get the right

156
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,280
amount of light

157
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
this thing is close this thing is

158
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,439
actually the top of it is right at the

159
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
line

160
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,038
i'd rather not i'm going to just take it

161
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:42,159
off so let's send that energy

162
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,319
elsewhere this one big big one

163
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,840
but you know what it's below the line i

164
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,599
know it's not going to reach

165
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,198
and i'm going to get in here it's a lot

166
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,879
of little ones

167
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,478
and this is you know again it's a

168
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,759
heartbreaker it's a spot that's going to

169
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,079
grow a bud

170
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,560
but it's not going to be desirable it's

171
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,359
going to take energy away

172
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,800
so again another nice looking clone if

173
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,000
you wanted to have a clone

174
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,680
here this is the time to take them um

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
but yeah it's just not going to be super

176
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
beneficial to you in the end

177
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,079
i must take this lower stuff off too

178
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,120
with the leaves kind of clean it up

179
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,120
and you know i i like to do this after

180
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,120
i've water and fed the plant

181
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
i want it to be strong when it's going

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,600
through this type of stress

183
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,840
the stress you know you don't want to

184
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,400
take the entire plant

185
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,439
but you can take a decent amount off

186
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,799
without causing

187
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,439
too much of a skip in the beat for the

188
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,919
plant

189
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,759
you know i give this maybe three four

190
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,599
days it's going to be right back on pace

191
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,160
with where it was going

192
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,039
and i do have another skunk number one

193
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
same size

194
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,159
hasn't been cleaned out and that is a

195
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,080
kind of a test so we'll see how much

196
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
this promotes and stimulates growth and

197
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,359
stretching

198
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,159
just from redistributing all the stuff

199
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,639
that was in these lower branches

200
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,560
so you can see it's a little bit cleaner

201
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,840
right now

202
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,120
i'm just going to kind of do a little

203
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,279
turn around here

204
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,120
oops cutting in front of the camera bad

205
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,598
poise maybe why don't i just spin this

206
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,519
beauty

207
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:21,038
give it vanna white style oh yeah

208
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:24,159
all right you right there

209
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:27,199
you're right at my line one two three

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,720
four five nodes away from the top

211
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,478
i'm just gonna take you cause i know i'm

212
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
gonna have five or six more nodes by the

213
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,758
time we're done

214
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,720
so goodbye same with you

215
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,840
goodbye and again you want to make sure

216
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
that you're clipping it

217
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,399
right at the main stem sometimes if you

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,759
uh don't clip it in the right spot it'll

219
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,638
just grow back

220
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,919
and that's not what you want so get out

221
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
of here

222
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,598
you you're so close but you know what

223
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,720
get out of here

224
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:02,079
you you get out of here too

225
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,400
everybody make like a tree and

226
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,399
leaf

227
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,240
all right one more again like i said i

228
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,959
tend to go

229
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
chop happy because i know how much this

230
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,839
plant can recover

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,319
and i know how much more new growth it's

232
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,799
going to have

233
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,800
that is looking pretty good to me let me

234
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,000
just give you guys a pin

235
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,840
up pan down and you'll see holy crap

236
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
that looks so much different from what

237
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,758
it did before

238
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,120
but you know what it promotes airflow

239
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,879
which is great

240
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,679
and see i got my line right there

241
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,799
everything is hanging out above that

242
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,199
line

243
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,559
everything below it i still have some

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,278
leafs to help transpire to help

245
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,518
photosynthesize

246
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,480
but that is a dramatically different

247
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,879
landscape

248
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,159
than when we started just a few minutes

249
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,320
ago as you can see

250
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,319
from above she's still a nice healthy

251
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,200
full looking plant

252
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,040
lots of lots of bud sites are gonna grow

253
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,000
and be nice

254
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,519
so we've got that going for her at least

255
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,600
and there she is

256
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,399
that was my process of getting a plant

257
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,360
ready to go into flower from veg

258
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,120
for my tight tent with not a whole bunch

259
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,519
of light penetration because i'm not

260
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,039
using a whole bunch of wattage in there

261
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,679
and that's fairly common for a home

262
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,958
grower and combined with the known

263
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,000
stretch of this plant

264
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,719
i went pretty high but as i said you see

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,039
the line

266
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,920
everything below it is clean everything

267
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,919
above it

268
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,319
once this plant stretches it should

269
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,439
still be getting good light penetration

270
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,600
and that's the key to good buds so

271
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
thank you for tuning in this is chad

272
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,240
westport

273
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,879
i hope you enjoyed the process and

274
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,560
please send us your tips i'd love to see

275
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,958
your videos and who knows

276
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,838
maybe we'll even play it on the show so

277
00:09:50,958 --> 00:10:02,319
thanks guys

278
00:09:51,839 --> 00:10:02,320
and i'll see you next time
