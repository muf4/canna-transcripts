1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,259
how's it going future cannabis project

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:09,620
Community Lobster fam Farms here today

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,679
I'm going to be going over my low-tech

4
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:16,138
home grow strategy on collecting male

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,820
pollen from the canvas plant

6
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,980
so this would be my first time

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,019
intentionally pollinating female

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,460
cannabis plants

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,460
there's a lot of things in life

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,560
necessity is the mother of invention

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,480
so something I'm looking for that

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,519
doesn't quite exist yet or that no one

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,439
else is trying to create so it seemed

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,480
like a worthwhile goal

15
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,079
what I'm looking for is something that's

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,359
very flavorful very energetic

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,120
and it's going to be a type 2 variety

18
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,640
that's going to be very rich in minor

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,699
cannabinoids

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,039
and to anyone making a living off of

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,420
seeds out there it's not my intention to

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,340
sell them

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,239
this is just to learn more about the

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,800
plant

25
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,078
initially it's just going to be

26
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,259
something for me in the squad if it

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,540
turns out to be something nice and fun

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,219
and eventually hopefully it'll make its

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:15,200
uh patience if it's deemed Worthy

30
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,200
let's go let's see what's doing

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,618
so these are some of the strategies I

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,320
set up and I feel like most people could

33
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,359
replicate this in any home environment

34
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,639
that also has a flowering room close by

35
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,819
that could be vulnerable even if you had

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,340
to use a sheet or just something simple

37
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:37,339
so I have this closet door opened

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,360
I have the humidifiers cranking create

39
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,859
this little

40
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,859
micro climate

41
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:54,118
we got it at 75 humidity so my intention

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,799
and hope is that anything that creeps

43
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,219
out of here

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,618
is going to be made non-viable if it

45
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,259
does when it creeps out not if it does

46
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,118
and so my next step is going to be to

47
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,098
use the pump sprayer and I'm going to

48
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,598
spray all around the door forgive me

49
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,738
house but I'm just going to drench

50
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,439
everything

51
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,060
and uh I'm gonna have to tune out for

52
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,098
this I'm going to try to Stage all the

53
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,580
stuff I have to bring in and then we'll

54
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:19,579
rock and roll

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,280
let's rock and roll time to creep in

56
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,878
here and creep out all stealth style

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,560
bing bang bada boom let's go

58
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,098
all right we're in

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,560
let's see what's going on in here

60
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:37,139
so the temperature and the humidity

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,500
temperature is a little bit warm for a

62
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:43,500
normal Garden but I'm more stoked on the

63
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,719
low humidity so I think the pollen that

64
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,539
I collected yesterday

65
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,639
is going to be good to swoop up and

66
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,539
store

67
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,539
possible

68
00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:00,119
this is what I scored yesterday not a

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,400
whole lot

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,099
but from what I've heard

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,980
a little goes a long way

72
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,719
now yesterday I collected this on

73
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,539
parchment paper

74
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,239
in the same room

75
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:17,939
that the males are in

76
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,019
now I think I can improve this after my

77
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:24,180
first time what I did was I set the

78
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:27,300
dehumidifier in this room

79
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,120
and after I collected the pollen I tried

80
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,239
to spray everything down and that jacked

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,060
humidity way up I think I could be more

82
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,219
effective by just tossing the dehue into

83
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,299
the closet

84
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:45,120
keeping out here very humid not very

85
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,760
humid keeping out here as dry as it is

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,099
now collecting my pollen

87
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,318
in the closet

88
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:55,199
closing the closet behind me with the

89
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,298
dehumidifier inside there and then using

90
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,699
my pump sprayer just spray everything in

91
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,040
here Down Jack the humidity way up spray

92
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:05,280
myself down

93
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,919
let's see how it goes

94
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,719
so I've got my business card

95
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,719
my storage container

96
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,839
lightly sweep it up

97
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,600
I got a little bit of soil mixed in

98
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,600
there on the first batch

99
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:34,219
I don't think it could be that bad

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,800
as soil typically found out and about

101
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:42,060
but not too often in the air

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,060
on the female pistols

103
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,639
but I'm hoping that that little bit of

104
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:51,978
soil in there

105
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,978
doesn't make too much of a difference

106
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,759
time to pack it up

107
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:05,279
let's take some pollen in the vial

108
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,280
not too much but I think it's more than

109
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,219
enough I'm gonna gather some more today

110
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,918
let's do that

111
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,180
so now I've got a new setup

112
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,180
in the closet

113
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,859
I'm going to bring the plants in here

114
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,860
and shake them

115
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,959
now we can shake some pollen off

116
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,419
what's interesting about these plants

117
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:35,279
was that I never flip them

118
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:36,959
to 12 12. they started showing full male

119
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,319
maturity

120
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,659
under 18 hours and I asked uh big

121
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,939
respect to sapo I asked him if like what

122
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,259
the variables could be for that and he

123
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:52,259
said it was sometimes when inbred lines

124
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:54,780
were veg too long in small containers

125
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,060
so appreciate the knowledge it seems

126
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,859
like both those variables were present I

127
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,720
was ensured that the pollen would still

128
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,759
be viable which is why I'm collecting it

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,220
and even if it's not

130
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,439
good practice I got some protocols in

131
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,780
order and if it is sterile there's no

132
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,170
risk to the rest of the garden so

133
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:23,049
just doing it

134
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:23,050
[Music]

135
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:49,920
moose

136
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:49,920
[Music]

137
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:00,300
this one smells very very good I'm gonna

138
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,399
keep this one separate and collect the

139
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,300
pollen on its own in a couple days

140
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,299
foreign

141
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,560
flowers

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,879
because they might contain moisture that

143
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,879
will make the pollen non-viable

144
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,799
it's kind of tedious

145
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,759
got to be done something new

146
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,978
so I've got everything separated all the

147
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,500
plant matter out that's what pollen I'm

148
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:42,659
left with I learned a valuable lesson

149
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,759
not to do hold your forehead over it if

150
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,520
you're sweating there's a little puddle

151
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,860
of uh no good in there but work with it

152
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,859
then I'm going to leave this here in the

153
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,699
closet I'm going to set the D Hue one to

154
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,139
40 percent humidity relative humidity

155
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,598
and then I'm going to creep out and

156
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,120
start spraying these plants

157
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,680
so we're up to 40 and up a little warmer

158
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,660
since I've been up here so it won't take

159
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,959
too much but I'm going to give them a

160
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,960
squirt

161
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,660
now my logic here is that I can try to

162
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,939
neutralize any pollen that might be left

163
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,759
on the plants or in the air and then if

164
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:23,219
any what does creep out through the door

165
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,038
will be neutralized by the little

166
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,259
humidity zone out there if not there's a

167
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:31,500
couple more doors and attempted barriers

168
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,360
but I know this stuff finds a way so I'm

169
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,440
going to spray everything down

170
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,440
forgive me room

171
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:47,399
got everything sprayed down

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,139
got the closet quarantined I'm just

173
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,899
sitting here and smoke one

174
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,659
let the humidity jack up

175
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,000
then I'm going to take off everything I

176
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,939
wore put it in a pile

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,740
I'm gonna spray that as much as I can

178
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,540
any tools that I brought in here that

179
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm bringing out including my cell phone

180
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:08,219
I'm going to give those a spray down

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
then I'm going to bring me and all that

182
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,120
stuff right to the bathroom even the

183
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,800
sprayer even though it was spraying

184
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,440
water I imagine there's some pollen on

185
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,539
there so I'm going to rinse everything

186
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,580
including me

187
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:23,519
right after the humidity gets to about

188
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,399
60 65 in here then I have my little

189
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,620
buffer zone out there that's like 75 and

190
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,679
then it's right to the bathroom

191
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,379
start throwing water on everything

192
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,519
and that's going to be too hot for TV so

193
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:37,519
I'll check you guys a little bit

194
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,719
so I'm out of the shower

195
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,639
I tried to rinse everything that I

196
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,800
brought back out of the room

197
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,439
and dry it off

198
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,559
and maybe take this time to do a little

199
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,140
outro or some closing thoughts

200
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,419
so while I do think there is some skill

201
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,220
in gathering the pollen and pollinating

202
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,620
the female plants

203
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,320
I think the real labor and time is going

204
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,139
to be through running through the

205
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,820
generation the next generation of seeds

206
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,139
I think that's going to take a lot of

207
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,060
time

208
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,799
I don't know I've never done this before

209
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,439
but I know just from you know running

210
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,359
other people's stuff it takes time

211
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,320
so I imagine this is going to be a long

212
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,820
while but I'm rather excited

213
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,620
I don't think I mentioned what plants

214
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm using the whole time

215
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,080
maybe get into that now the males that I

216
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,679
was collecting pollen off of were

217
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:44,040
Mendocino pineapple I believe if not

218
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:46,979
bread popularized by Ringo

219
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,500
the ones I got come by way of ital

220
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,240
foundation adamando

221
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,578
I believe they were labeled Island

222
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:59,399
Paradise but uh I think they're

223
00:10:55,578 --> 00:11:01,739
f4s of the Mendo pineapple which I've

224
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,720
never grown myself I have some friends

225
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,120
that have worked on farms in Mendocino

226
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,040
that have told me about the plant

227
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,159
I've definitely ran through a bunch of

228
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:13,319
it and uh we always dug it we always

229
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,480
really liked it

230
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,480
um I did not know that it had so many

231
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,019
minor cannabinoids in it which is what

232
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,899
truly interested me and motivated me to

233
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:28,139
try to collect the pollen and throw it

234
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:30,958
it seemed like it would be a little bit

235
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,120
easier of a learning curve it being an

236
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,119
F4 and pretty stable

237
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,100
and when I asked ital about it

238
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,820
he was kind of saying that like you know

239
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,040
any mail will be the pineapple which uh

240
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,140
was very encouraging

241
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,000
and maybe it will limit the amount of

242
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,860
population I have to run through to look

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,899
for what I'm looking for if it is in

244
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,079
there

245
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:57,000
the female that it'll be hit on is an

246
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:02,039
early flowering Northern Lights number

247
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,919
five Haze which is donned the PC3 by

248
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:08,278
piff Coast Farms this is something that

249
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:10,559
I very very very much so enjoy myself

250
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:13,500
the people around me very much so enjoy

251
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,078
it I think that in itself

252
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,879
has medicinal value I haven't had a lab

253
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,620
tested yet it's going to be lab tested

254
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:21,778
within a month or so

255
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,299
but I feel like both of them together

256
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:26,159
could really be something first and

257
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,078
foremost I want to try to combine the

258
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,899
flavors because I'm very flavor based

259
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,939
with my consumption so the way I

260
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,278
Envision it and again I do not know what

261
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,339
I'm doing this is just the concept in my

262
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,439
vision we'll see what comes of it but I

263
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,640
would love if there was a nice pineapple

264
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,240
inhale

265
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,980
and then a nice hazy piffy exhale

266
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,000
if I go find something in there with

267
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,320
that I'd be very very very happy

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,139
um I think

269
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,720
the energetic nature and just generally

270
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:00,600
soaring Good Vibes

271
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,959
of the PC3

272
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,300
and kind of like the no ceiling

273
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,859
high on it I think that might pair well

274
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:09,419
with the pineapple as well as the

275
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,419
pineapple is kind of more like a feel

276
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:14,519
good mellow Buzz so I think that they'll

277
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:18,299
marry well

278
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,639
I don't think that

279
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,979
at least for me and my crew most people

280
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,459
that like the hazy ones are usually not

281
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,620
super Discerning on THC numbers

282
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:32,039
so I think that's one thing that's cool

283
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,919
too if it does become something fun and

284
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,958
worthwhile to like run and share

285
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,500
I don't think people that were looking

286
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,359
for a type 2 variety would care too much

287
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,700
about high THC

288
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,039
and I don't think too many Haze heads

289
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,079
are ever concerned about that at all I

290
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,059
think it's just a bonus if it tests like

291
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,638
above 20 or is kind of like you know

292
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:58,559
some interesting numbers

293
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:01,680
so I'm very encouraged to do it and um

294
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,319
I'll be making seeds I just put the uh

295
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,599
the couple pc3s into the flower room

296
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,639
with the males they're not on the same

297
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,700
schedule but I'm just gonna start there

298
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,200
get their hormones going 12 12 now

299
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,778
and um

300
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,720
so it'll be about 10 11 weeks until

301
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:22,139
they're harvested I'll be popping seeds

302
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,600
immediately after that and uh by then it

303
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:27,899
should be close to Springtime as well so

304
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,139
I can see what the first generation f1s

305
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:33,299
are gonna do out in the main sunshine

306
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,278
and also what they'll do in an inside

307
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,639
environment so I'm very excited about

308
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:37,639
that

309
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,879
um and thank you to everyone who's

310
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,759
anyone who's ever shared knowledge about

311
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,198
this stuff like most things I kind of

312
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,620
take what I like

313
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:53,039
like a salad bar of information

314
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,198
try to formulate my own strategy but a

315
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,838
lot of these Concepts being implemented

316
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,439
were suggested or talked about by

317
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,440
someone else

318
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,600
um

319
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,039
can't think of too much more I'm very

320
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,659
excited I hope to document the process

321
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,500
some more I don't know if it'll

322
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:15,179
necessarily be here on FCP but certainly

323
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,860
I'm going to keep track of it very

324
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,479
excited I'm going to go collect the rest

325
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,778
of the pollen I

326
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,940
grab tomorrow let it sit for like 12 20

327
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:25,860
hours and that little dehume environment

328
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,560
I threw the pollen that I did collect

329
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,600
directly into the freezer

330
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,518
um after collecting it I was a little

331
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,620
nervous about the little bits of soil in

332
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,860
there I imagine they're holding a fair

333
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,078
amount of moisture so my logic was to

334
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,360
put it right in the freezer

335
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,638
and kind of just get everything real

336
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,440
cold before too much moisture could move

337
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,180
around I don't know if there's any logic

338
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,920
in that but when I gather the batch

339
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:51,599
tomorrow I'm going to try to be a little

340
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,919
bit more cautious and not leaving any

341
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,259
little bits of soil in there

342
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,479
um there was one that smelled very

343
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,958
special as I was shaking them all

344
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,360
earlier one of them and it wasn't so

345
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,458
pineappley it was like a deep note like

346
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,320
it wasn't sweet it was like a low end

347
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:12,359
kind of funky note

348
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,699
and uh

349
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,579
I thought I was just imagining it I gave

350
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:20,698
it a little stomach stem rub and it was

351
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:23,519
very very strong aroma so I have that

352
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:25,259
one set aside I'll probably let that one

353
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,899
flower out a little bit longer and

354
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,879
collect that pollen individually maybe

355
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,860
put another female in there a week or

356
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:35,458
two behind it after I've sprayed down

357
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,620
the room and jacked the humidity and uh

358
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,599
I'm very excited thank you future

359
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,639
cannabis projects for all the knowledge

360
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,519
thank you to everyone else who's kind of

361
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:47,399
like open source with their stuff much

362
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,019
respect and uh wish me the best I really

363
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,958
don't know what I'm doing I mean I know

364
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,940
what I want like most of us do but uh as

365
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,578
far as how to get there

366
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:00,320
only one way to start we'll see where it

367
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:00,319
goes appreciate everyone
