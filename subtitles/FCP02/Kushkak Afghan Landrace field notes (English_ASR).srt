1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
hey there hey we're out at our uh land

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,279
race Botanical Garden again doing field

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,919
notes for this very cool Afghan plant

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:16,378
and this particular variety is called

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:20,219
Kush [Â __Â ] cushcock and uh this is an

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:23,179
incredibly unique terpene profile I'm

7
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,179
just gonna open it up

8
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:29,399
and smell and uh

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,359
what's so interesting about this one is

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:35,100
it smells like Mesquite smoke at least

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,039
that's what I'm picking up it already

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:42,359
smells like smoke but really good

13
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:45,359
Mesquite smoke kind of with a scedery

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,460
almost bug spray kind of smell but it's

15
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,378
really intoxicating and Incredibly

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,878
unique so I'm very excited about this

17
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:55,799
plant and today is October 18th by the

18
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,679
way it's really hot so sorry if I'm

19
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,378
oozing sweat it's incredibly hot today

20
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,238
surprisingly and uh but we're gonna

21
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,179
Harvest this today so just want to

22
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,700
document it we'll cruise around

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,040
maybe this might be a good bud

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,540
come in on

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,960
um reality is could probably go

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,680
three four five days longer but uh

27
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,419
they're really really thick dense Buds

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,939
and uh we're getting a lot of wet nights

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,799
so I'm really a little concerned and I

30
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:32,339
can only make it out here

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,618
every few days if I lived here full time

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,540
anyway I'd be able to stay on it a

33
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,478
little more but uh right now they're

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,360
close enough to harvest and don't want

35
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,640
to see them start uh imploding or

36
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,978
getting a mold so I think we're going to

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,680
take it today but bottom line it's

38
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,539
really really really cool Plant very

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,820
excited about it

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,500
kushcock

41
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,359
yet another

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,040
each Afghan I'm trying to think which

43
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,438
ones are my favorites but to tell you

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,960
each one is incredibly cool in its own

45
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,599
right and they all have unique terpenes

46
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,699
and this is yet another one but that

47
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,759
mesky smoke

48
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,139
is probably yeah none of them none of

49
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,000
the other ones smell like this so that's

50
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,679
something really unique about this place

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,800
oh and then one other thing wanted to

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,800
show

53
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,539
here's another kushcock that we already

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,180
started harvesting so and here you'll

55
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,739
see that uh starting to purple up a

56
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,860
little bit it's getting a little darker

57
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,480
at night so this plant if it were colder

58
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,840
at night we'd probably get a lot more of

59
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:40,139
the purple and black but uh

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,360
uh yeah it's been warmer than usual so

61
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:44,098
everything's kind of green still anyway

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,940
great plant

63
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,939
that's it
