so welcome yeah

60
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,759
so um how was the process of getting

61
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,958
open here

62
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,399
it was

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,360
it was a long

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,680
it was a long road 2020 was when i

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,400
started uh may of 2020

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,159
um you know i was i was looking around

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,680
being like gosh should i do it should i

68
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,919
not i don't know because this was a

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,959
commercial kitchen at the time

70
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,119
and

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,640
it would have been

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,200
easy to just leave it as a commercial

73
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,079
kitchen and rent it out

74
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,000
but you know new england is

75
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
in my opinion i grew up in new hampshire

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,239
and um you know new england is famous

77
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,560
for being progressive but then

78
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,439
once the floodgates of progressivism

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
open

80
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,359
they put the brakes on and that kind of

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,719
was what i expected to happen so i was

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
like man if i'm going to do it i better

83
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,878
apply now so i filled out

84
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,400
you know the initial application with

85
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,399
the town planner and then you have to

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,280
work with the town planner

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
and

88
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,680
fill out

89
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,518
you know several hundred pages of of

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
site plans and

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,158
all that kind of thing

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
and then you go before the town and and

93
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:38,959
they

94
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,959
decide whether or not they're going to

95
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,920
give you the thumbs up

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,200
and

97
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,598
then once they give you the thumbs up

98
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:50,479
which happened to for me in december

99
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,719
2020 then you've got six months to start

100
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,759
and you've got a complete 25

101
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,318
of

102
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,719
any changes within six months and so

103
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,719
what counted as 25 for me was paving and

104
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,560
it was the middle of winter and so i

105
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,479
couldn't get paving done and so it went

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
down to the wire i got the paving done

107
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,318
in april 2021

108
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,598
and then you know we're in the middle of

109
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,919
covid so

110
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,238
then you know my carpenter's coming in

111
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,560
to do work in here and he couldn't get

112
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,879
supplies and getting windows like a

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,120
skylight and that kind of thing put in

114
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,879
you know took until august

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,720
and then getting security put in

116
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,240
security is all backed up they're

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
getting all their stuff from china and

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,759
then everybody and their mom is starting

119
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,239
on adult use grow and so they're have

120
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,199
huge projects and so i was kind of

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,160
back seated for a while and that got put

122
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,759
in in

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
december

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,000
and

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,840
then that um delayed for two months

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
because i had the wrong recorder and i

127
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,679
had to get that from china and that took

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,560
two months to get here so then

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,519
we're in february 2022

130
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,478
and then i go before the town again

131
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,560
because i

132
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,719
i initially applied as

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,879
i initially applied

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
as one company and i thought i could

135
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,959
just easily change it and they're like

136
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,319
no no you have to get a new license so i

137
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,918
had to get a new license go before the

138
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,399
town that happened in march and then i

139
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,959
opened this month in april just in time

140
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,120
for 4 20.

141
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,079
i'm sorry so that was it yeah sounds

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,319
like a grueling process but i'm glad you

143
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,240
made it here and i imagine it might be

144
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,680
even less grueling than some states you

145
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,918
know so it doesn't sound easy but yeah

146
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,519
glad you made it i think i think in

147
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,319
maine at least

148
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,319
the small guy has a shot yeah you know

149
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,560
and and i think that that's why you see

150
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,560
such a thriving community of caregivers

151
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,879
in the state and you see such

152
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,519
active legislative participation from

153
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,719
caregivers because they have a shot

154
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,799
and they have a voice whereas i think in

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
other states at least my impression is

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,319
that there's

157
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,560
there's not even a chance

158
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,879
yeah yeah i agree

159
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
slight chance of anything

160
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,038
on the way

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,879
rolling the dice yeah exactly

162
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,318
okay um what products are have the most

163
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,680
movement or if there's anything that

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,280
you're just stoked to share you want to

165
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,439
show us a couple of the flowers that you

166
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,959
think are the best or whatever products

167
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,959
in general are moving whether it be

168
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,359
vapes or

169
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,198
rosin or edibles or the

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
shiatsu kush

171

255
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,519
that question is do you foresee in 2023

industry tied into the snack industry

258
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,719
whereas you know doritos and nestle are

259
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,399
going to start getting involved with the

260
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,480
cannabis industry or even the smaller

261
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,320
you know let's say craft

262
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,480
uh snackers

263
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,879

figuring out how to do it you know yeah

272
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,560
you know i think

273
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,159
doritos or you know i mean you see

274
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,719

275
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,480
things but snackies would be phenomenal

276
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,560
yeah you know and the hummus i would

277
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,759

awesome

279
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,480
the reason i ask is i think mr guerrero

280
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,599
he's forecasting that that's going to be

281
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,639
the next explosion of the industry

282
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,639
