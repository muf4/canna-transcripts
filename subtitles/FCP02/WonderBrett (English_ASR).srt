Candyland Candyland was like one of my

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,800
favorite cookies like type genetics that

48
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:26,039
were around in the early you know 2010

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,519
2014 like kind of space around there so

50
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,120
crossing the O mail into that like it

51
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:31,400
just

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,800
I didn't know what I was going to get

53
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,319
but Pig Picasso is a special strain it's

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,200
like very cool now I'm super excited to

55
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,158
try it it has a reputation the preds it

56
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,560
to the Candy Land is that from one of

57
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:46,199
the cookie fam guys originally or no

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:50,120
it's it was like um somebody just in the

59
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:52,238
bay uh bred it fire but it was it was

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,000
definitely like a a notable strain

61
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,400
during that time cuz everybody was

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,840
really looking for like the the form cut

63
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,920
cookies and and then to have that cross

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,400
L into GDP the granddaddy

65
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,878
per well and it came right on the like

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,400
the cookies came on the crest of the

67
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,039
pers thing yeah so like it made a lot of

68
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,400
sense and maybe there's even perss in

69
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,598
the Cherry Pie who who knows yeah

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,760
totally and let's not discount the GDP

71
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,598
yeah no GDP is a great strain when like

72
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,719
it's awesome I mean Urkel I think is

73
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,518
like as good as this plant can get yeah

74
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,400
yeah which all all used to be known as

75
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,438
the purple

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,519
Nepal any want to dry hit this yeah yeah

77
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:36,318
I love your pink Picasso by the way yeah

78
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,200
it's a it's a crowd favorite it's one of

79
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,560
my favorites like one of the things that

80
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,598
that like we created where I was just

81
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,120
like wow we I think we created something

82
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:49,919
really special and um it unique it was

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,158
just it's really unique like the tarpine

84
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,598
profile on it is is different than a lot

85
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,560
of other strains it's cool you get like

86
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,280
that little bit of candy from the Z but

87
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,840
you still really get that like Smooth

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,199
cooked

89
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,920
yeah perss it's nice um and so the OC

90
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,798
seems like a staple throughout a lot of

91
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,199
your work I think definitely the first

92
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,200
time I tried anything for you was

93
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,518
probably like 2018 on the rec Mark and

94
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,599
was O K was fire really honestly some of

95
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,358
the best quality I've seen on Metric

96
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,680
awesome um but so why the O like why is

97
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:25,918
that one that you've well uh it has the

98
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,160
the OG in it which was what I grew for

99
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:32,319
like you know probably like you know 20

100
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,080
well for from now to when I started it's

101
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:40,199
like over 20 years um got that ligh um

102
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,399
but uh OG's just always been a great

103
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,600
strain like straight up and um it's I

104
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,079
think it'll always be one of the best

105
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,720
strains that we're ever discovered and

106
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,719
found and created

107
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,039
um and then Skittles came on and you

108
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,520
just you're like wow what a really

109
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:01,199
really special tpine profile it you know

110
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,359
when I saw it it was just little when I

111
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,720
first saw it it was just little tiny

112
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,400
buds it was like you you couldn't at

113
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,840
least from when I first started getting

114
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,638
it was like you couldn't find like good

115
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,879
nugs of it or I think the good nugs are

116
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,319
is a lot of the 2.0 it's like a back

117
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,680
cross workor I think if you have that

118
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:24,000
first real cut like Cooks you're getting

119
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,800
Pebbles grateful to have those so we

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,038
were we were all like pretty Blown Away

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,478
with the turpine profile on the Skittles

122
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:35,038
what year was that that was

123
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:37,038
when let's see I would

124
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,918
say

125
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,519
2017 when I think I first stumbled

126
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,560
across it maybe like and I was looking

127
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,240
for it and I I bought a bunch of it cuz

128
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,319
I was like well maybe I'll find a bag

129
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,800
seed and I did find a bag seed I I

130
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,160
started to pop that bag seed and then

131
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,720
like two months later a buddy from

132
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,360
Humble actually gave me the cut oh wow

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,000
so I got the original cut and I had a

134
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,080
bag seed cut I don't know if it was 17

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,918
or 16 but a lot of people got introduced

136
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,680
to it at an emerald cup or like di had

137
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,799
had a booth and people were like you

138
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,079
said just buying ounces hoping to get

139
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,639
like one bag see it yeah uh cuz it was

140
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,318
so wildly different and tasty yeah it

141
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,720
was it was crazy um the lines were long

142
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,879
and you know you would buy an eth and it

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,240
you'd pour it out and it would just be

144
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,839
like literally like uh a like a tin of

145
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,598
Smalls or a plastic quarter of Smalls

146
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,719
you know like gnarly little nuggies yeah

147
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:33,279
they were tell tasty though for like I

148
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,759
was like not impressed lookwise but as

149
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,000
soon as you kind of start to break it up

150
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,560
and smell it You' be like oh this is

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,319
special and then you soon as you tasted

152
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
it you're like yeah this tastes like you

153
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,400
know Froot Loops and candy and Skittles

154
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
and you understand why they called it

155
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:50,679
Skittles because it was yeah so what did

156
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,198
you do with that first cut of Skittles

157
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,360
and you had also the ozk which was came

158
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,720
from the original kush yeah so the ozk

159
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,319
came like about a year later when they

160
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,919
released the seed

161
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:07,319
uh of uh the Eddy LEP OG crossed

162
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:11,439

dying grd yeah fire yeah no doubt um and

164
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,079
that was released at this

165
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,879
like uh double

166
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:22,719
weekend like High Times event and

167
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,879
uh they they were releasing it and then

168
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,440
this their trailer got broken into and a

169
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,759
lot of their seeds got stolen at the

170
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,719
hotel then then like the night before

171
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,800
everything was getting released I

172
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,759
remember we were all like setting up

173
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,840
everything I was setting up my booth

174
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,319
they were setting up their Booth we were

175
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,279
right across like the courtyard from

176
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
each other that they had set up and I

177
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,000
was like talking to the guys and they

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,120
were like yeah we'll have everything I

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,879
I'll put aside some packs for you

180
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,800
tomorrow and I was like cool I wasn't

181
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,000
worried about it they said they set it

182
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,439
aside and then all that stuff happened

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,918
that night and uh I didn't get any packs

184
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,000
from them cuz it all got stolen and it

185
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,878
was really like a shitty deal shitty

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,399
story for them I can only imagine how

187
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,199
depressed they were like seeds are not

188
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,799
are very dear I guess yeah those those

189
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,360
are not I don't know what happened to

190
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,800
all those seeds that got stolen or where

191
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,199
they went because I feel like whoever

192
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,800
stole it like I never heard about those

193
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,478
seeds popping up on the black market

194
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,439
like I feel like whoever stole it didn't

195
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,120
know what they stole and just kind of

196
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,800
probably were like this is worthless you

197
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
know like just probably threw all that

198
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,598
seeds yeah just probably like threw all

199
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,240
that [ __ ] aside had no idea what it was

200
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:30,079
and and you know got rid of it um maybe

201
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,278
the the packaging was opaque and they

202
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,319
thought it was weed or

203
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,038
something who knows you know I mean we

204
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,719
were all out in uh the middle of nowhere

205
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:45,799
out there at uh Glenn

206
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:48,200
Helen uh wherever that is bont or I San

207
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:51,120
berino somewhere over there yeah yeah

208
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,360
the the fairgrounds or whatever right

209
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,519
and so before before you got the Z were

210
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,079
you just growing OG is that how it I was

211
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:03,759
growing OG for for since '98 and then

212
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:06,519
um in like

213
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,958
2006 2007 I started doing my own

214
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,639
breeding cuz I kind of just I loved OG

215
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,278
but I was getting tired of the strain

216
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,759
cuz it was just you can't smoke the same

217
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,919
[ __ ] forever and I feel like if they if

218
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,399
there is one it would be OG but I and

219
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,639
you know he still got you high no matter

220
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,399
what like even if you got had like a

221
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,240
crazy tolerance for OG you still got

222
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,799
stoned off of it which was the what was

223
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,000
so special about it it was like whereas

224
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,759
other Strang

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,159
if you spoke that whatever it was for

226
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,759
like a few weeks like you were just not

227
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:36,519
getting stoned off of it well also I

228
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,200
feel like that's what's the not to go

229
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,000
back to the ZK but that's the real

230
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,640
benefit of that cross too like it can

231
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,679
really ring your bell whereas Z unless

232
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,720
you take it just way too long for it to

233
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,399
be delicious you're not going to get

234
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,879
that high I agree uh and that was why it

235
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,360
was so special cuz OG potency and the

236
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:58,759
Skittles turps I was blessed to get a

237
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,278

277
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,440
grower here this doesn't belong in my

278
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,278
hands he was like I'm not going to be

279
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,440
able to grow this out so he he blessed

280
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,919
me with that pack and um that's awesome

281
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,200
it was just kind of like destiny that I

282
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,199
ended up with it still in the end and I

283
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,160
found out of that pack I found you know

284
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,000
there's only 12 seeds in there I only

285
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:47,000
pop half the pack of seeds I still have

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,278
the original half pack of that oh wow

287
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,559
and I found what is the that ozk cut is

288
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,439
like the Pinnacle definitive o cut that

289
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,559
everybody loves that's that Perfect

290
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,720
Blend of Skittles and and OG that has

291
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,479
the potency and the of OG and the the

292
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,480
turps of o were all the seeds

293
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,959
consistent um no yeah no there was like

294
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,079
two other females that

295
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,559
were contenders but they just they were

296
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,879
leaning more OG and not leaning as much

297
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,838
Skittles and then there was the you know

298
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,919
two males I think that I got out of as

299
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,040
well I think I popped six of the seeds I

300
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:23,319
think only five of them

301
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,240
popped did anything have any color or

302
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,000
was it all just green we no it has color

303
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,000
if if you can you know you can shock it

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,159
with some cold um it'll put a little bit

305
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,120
of purple in there for sure H yeah um

306
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,639
but purple wasn't a thing at the time

307
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,560
like like it is now you know like purple

308
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,079
weed is desirable really right now what

309
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:44,078
year was that

310
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:49,958
again early 90s no we're talking 2017

311
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,279
yeah 2017 probably 2018 at that point if

312
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,239
you look on my

313
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,519
Instagram I post and show all the stuff

314
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,278
of like even when I was popping those

315
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,360
packs of seeds when I found the bag seed

316
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:05,278
a few months before that um how long

317
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,800
have you had your Instagram since

318
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,439
200 uh I think 13 or 14 yeah when if you

319
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:13,000
go all the way back it it goes back that

320
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,959
far wow it's it's nice to have like this

321
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,399
record timeline absolutely well for and

322
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,518
for the recent stuff but then everything

323
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,240
before that I mean the forums are useful

324
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,879
but I think yeah one thing I wanted to

325
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,959
ask about is like what do you think OG

326
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,120
Kos is I know there's a lot of stories

327
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:31,719
in you're pretty associated with sort of

328
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,278
it's come up in California yeah yeah I

329
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,879
mean when I first got the cut everybody

330
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,838
said you know this came this cut came

331
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,039
from Florida and it used to uh be

332
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,040
potentially called the crippy or or

333
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,360
super

334
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,399
not um was kind of like some of the

335
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,720
rumors were going around when I first

336
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,720
got the strain like you know during that

337
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,160
first year or two of growing it

338
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,839
um but everything you know that is

339
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,159
there's been guys who talked about it

340
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,399
being like from California NorCal like

341
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,838
like I don't really believe any of that

342
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,839
I think it really did come from Florida

343
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,079
but did did you get the cut from a guy

344
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,160
who got the cut from Josh yes okay yeah

345
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,958
I got from Josh's friend and uh he lived

346
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,799
in the bay and uh that's it seems like

347
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,278
there's consensus among a lot of people

348
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:25,000
that like it can't like Josh got it

349
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:27,039
via SHP or whatever like yeah Mt and as

350
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,480
far as I know from talking with Josh and

351
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,799
and all the updated stories that that

352
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,480
have came out

353
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,719
like which I believe you know Josh he's

354
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:42,120
reputable no reason to and and everybody

355
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,120
backs him up around it too so

356
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,639

grown and we would both we just both had

370
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:21,360
two small spots and you know I would

371
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
take some of his work he would take some

372
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,639
of my work whatever we needed to and

373
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,639
they were both really great batches but

374
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,759
uh Cody was like we're going to call

375
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,360
this one Irene and we're going to call

376
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:36,639
this one Larry and so you had Larry OG

377
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,039
and Irene OG both named in front of me

378
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,839
that day were just be re were just

379
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,958
renames of the original cut oh wow and

380
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,560
there weren't anything different about

381
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,039
now maybe once those names caught on

382
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,198
over time like other Growers were like

383
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,958
I'm going to call my [ __ ] Irene and I'm

384
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,719
all this will be I'll have the Larry OG

385
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,638
or whatever or something like that but

386
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,759
but I remember the Irene from way

387
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,440
back yeah I mean how far back though cuz

388
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,600
that to me is like I would say let me

389
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,319
see I would say like 2004 or something

390
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,240
2005 is when I think that kind of

391
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:13,599
happened really yeah cuz I remember it

392
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,198
from like ' 80s yeah no I I think there

393
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,959
there's there may be a different might

394
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:23,519
just be recy

395
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:26,359
mayene but the Irene like uh I was still

396
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,839
just like playing with GI Joe you

397
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,639
know anybody remember Barefoot Mike

398
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,199
no probably not he was he was the

399
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,240
connect for the

400
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:40,599
Iran that's was it was it a was it an OG

401
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,799
Kush the the IR in your time was it an

402
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,720
OG Kush it was that's what I mentioned

403
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:49,159
it why I mentioned it because it was

404
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,720
very similar to OG before OG interesting

405
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:53,278
um I could see that being a possibility

406
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,160
I mean things move around the world and

407
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,679
things get recycled and rened yeah and

408
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,278
you know if something came from Florida

409
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,719
there's a good chance it could have been

410
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:02,278
Colombian related you know what I mean

411
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,240
CU all the Colombian came in through

412
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:09,279

450
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,558
oh oh I know what you're talking about

451
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,839
this type of grinder yeah the mill yeah

452
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:50,158
I like the hemp shredders but yeah let's

453
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:53,038
see how this works but the the Cherry

454
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,880
cookie was the uh the pack of seeds that

455
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,558
I got the mail out of cleaned it from

456
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,520
Relentless from Relentless right and

457
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,678
what is the Cherry cook so if you're

458
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,480
watching now you look at the bong and

459
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,559
notice how clean it is it's like fire

460
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,720
cookies he had this and who cleaned that

461
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:10,158
so what's crazy is I would be seeing him

462
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,000
on Instagram posting all the time and uh

463
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:13,799
he' always post this I think it was

464
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,759
called fire cookies or Fire Cherry

465
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:20,720
cookies yeah yeah and um it it looked

466
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,480
just amazing and I I didn't know that uh

467
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,200
he was selling the seed packs like I

468
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,400
just didn't click or something and until

469
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,798
like a like a year or two after like me

470
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,159
following him and I don't maybe he

471
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,119
wasn't selling the seed packs at that

472
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,440
point when I started following him and

473
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:38,000
it just kind of he started that line or

474
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:40,279
something but that's where I got the uh

475
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,640
um the Cherry cooking mail from and do

476
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:46,119
you know what the Cherry in that

477
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,480
is again I have to look like charts yeah

478
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,479
but it's that I'm sure Relentless he's

479
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,720
pretty meticulous about his like family

480
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,319
tree breakout you know like yeah um so

481
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,200
that was that was where I got that and I

482
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,319
used the mail from the the cherri's

483
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,798
cookie pack pack um and it might have

484
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:05,720
been like an F2 pack or an F3 pack as

485
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:08,558
well

486
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:13,759
um and I used that mail into the

487
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:16,200
ozk and um found this what was the The

488
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,359
Keeper pheno of that which is the Kush

489
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,919
Cola which I didn't want to put the word

490
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,199
Cherry in the title because I just feel

491
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,960
like Cherry would have turned people

492
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,840
into thinking that it was like a lcg

493
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,440
cross or something for sure because lcg

494
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:32,599
is you know the Lemon Cherry L is so

495
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,919
popular right now in in in certain

496
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,359
circles and has been for a while so I

497
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
didn't want to put the word Cherry in

498
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,599
the title even though it could have

499
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,000
easily been called like Cherry Kush Cola

500
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,359
or something like that but it just went

501
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,880
with Kush Cola and then let people read

502
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,558

straight oranges when I got it but the

535
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,759
it smelled like bananas when you smelt

536
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,278
it it was like the first time I'd ever

537
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,319
it's still the only time I've ever been

538
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:23,480

non mistakable yeah and then when but as

542
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:30,558
soon as you light it up and smoke it

543
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,320
You' be like this [ __ ] tastes super

544
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,359
orange but you said it's different than

545
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,278
like a Tanger or drop so when what way

546
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:41,158
does it hit the pette differently

547
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:43,880
um the orange Sunset really tastes like

548
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,640
probably like orange sun-kissed soda oh

549
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:50,320
cool like like mandarin orange like

550
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,880
really sweet too like cuz that Skittles

551
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,119
in there the cuz the OC was the receiver

552
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,640
the ozk was the male oh was the D so

553
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,079
You' used the OC as the donor and the

554
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,080
receiver yeah yeah

555
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,918
yeah cuz when I used the mail it was my

556
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:08,079
it was like the I was still early on in

557
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,080
the breeding like

558
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,278
education cuz people wer really talking

559
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,120
about breeding and I I don't maybe they

560
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:17,079
were I was just not in the right Circle

561
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:19,399
yeah but um people just were just

562
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:20,839
everybody was clone chasing constantly

563
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,880
like there wasn't a lot of seed popping

564
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,079
or feno hunting like it smells good also

565
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,840
like I wasn't paying attention but I

566
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:29,678
feel like it's I've come to realize that

567
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,199
like that's really Al a super intensely

568
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,960
Southern California thing to be like

569
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,360
[ __ ] the seeds [ __ ] like I'm going to

570
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,440
get the elites and I'm going to run the

571
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,000
elites and I'm going to have packs of

572
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,960
Elites I agree yeah that's nice it's it

573
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,480
is very much that scent uh that that

574
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,519
type of scenario going on right now and

575
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,519
it has been for a long time like there

576
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:51,918
are people that love the weed for the

577
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,558
sake of growing it and there's people

578
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,520
that like making money straight up and

579
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,038
so they're just the people I think that

580
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,038
are chasing that are really just chasing

581
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,960
the money

582
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,879
um and they're they're just going to

583
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,000
jump from one bandwagon of strains to

584
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,600
the next like whatever and I get it

585
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,759
listen growing weed can be very

586
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,959
expensive the learning curve to figuring

587
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:15,440
it out and then the cost of of where you

588
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,079
do it how you do

589
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,200
it putting it on Metric that's what my

590
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:24,079
wife's been telling me I mean even

591
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,399
listen uh growing it at Mass scale are

592
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,519
you about to talk about your love of

593
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:31,479
metric is that where this going just

594
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,158
that's another it's another cost totally

595
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,240
you have you know what I would you know

596
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,799
Brett as a teacher I would love for you

597
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,359
to tell your how weed helps you focus

598
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:45,839
and how it did it yeah yeah um yeah I

599
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:49,479
mean I've always had ad and dyslexia

600
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:51,639
kind of not a great student and um they

601
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,120
put me on some of once they kind of

602
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,000
diagnosed me they were like hey we we

603
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,000
should give you Ridin and they you I

604
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,119
took this Ridin stuff and Dex green is

605
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,679
one of the other ones too it's basically

606
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,959
like speed yeah like methamphetamine

607
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,519
speed whatever used to snort riddling

608
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,798
late at night yeah I didn't realize what

609
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,240
it really was when they gave it to me

610
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,720
cuz I'm like oh doctors are giving to me

611
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,440
and I was like in like 9th 10th grade

612
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,558
and

613
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,600
um I didn't really and that was so

614
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:23,960
common yeah actually no it was much

615
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:27,119
younger than that that was actually like

616
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,319
in like seven there was like sixth

617
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,199
seventh grade actually he was the very

618
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:35,359
first kid to ever that there basically

619
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,240
Whispers that he was on some super drug

620
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:41,000
that made him like study

621
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,278
bionically because all he would do would

622
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,359
sit in the library and read like physics

623
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,519
textbooks chemistry textbooks and we'd

624
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:52,719
all be like how does he do it yeah you

625
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:55,079
know definitely like what I I remember

626
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,558
realizing you know it kept me up a lot

627
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:01,240
at night and I would just be like it was

628
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,678
cuz I didn't really like to to geek out

629
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,200
on like computers or reading like we

630
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,080
just got a computer for the first time

631
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,600
in our house it was like a one of those

632
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,720
early Macintosh you know like and I was

633
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,879
like I'd play with it for like 20

634
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,600
minutes and you know video games here

635
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,360
there but mostly I would just stay up at

636
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,359
night and just like make artwork yeah

637
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,678
you know like um and when did you make

638
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:24,439
the transition to not on a computer too

639
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,320
like freehand yeah and this this is

640
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,399
before you kind of discovered

641
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,240
weed yeah this is like right what

642
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:31,599
started to discover weed like at the

643
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,558
same time

644
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:37,359
and weed and fun activities like

645
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:40,519
learning how to play the guitar

646
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,719
and I didn't realize like until I got

647
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,679
enough

648
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,278
weed access to it like what it was it

649
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,000
was how it it was really that for a

650
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:51,200
second like it helping me you know that

651
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,240
sense of and so then you at some point

652
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,480
you just ceased taking chemicals yeah I

653
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,120
was just like I don't want to take these

654
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,440
like uh not

655
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:05,239
yeah I was I real I was just getting

656
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,038
like a a better level of uh like

657
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,038
comfortability and focus you know I mean

658
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:11,440
MH and what were like the early insights

659
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:13,398
like did you notice certain strains

660
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,640
affect you certain way certain time of

661
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,959
days made sense for smoking like what

662
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,038
were your early learnings around the

663
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,440
plan as medicine for you well we that's

664
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,200
what I think why it took me so long to

665
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,120
really kind of just hone in on it

666
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:30,240
because it was like it you got such

667
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,719
random [ __ ] straight up right like in in

668
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,278
like the mid99s like early '90s you

669
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:40,839
would you would get like a an ounce of

670
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:42,839
um oh that just Boomerang nice yeah you

671
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,240
would get like an ounce of um like

672
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,558
stress like seated weed you know from

673
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,120
South of the Border or something like

674
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,879
that or wherever it came from and uh it

675
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,439
would be like you know 80 100 bucks for

676
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,960
an ounce and you'd be deeding all day

677
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,278
and trying to learn how to that was I

678
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,240
just like sit there with my cousin Eric

679
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:59,359
and we would just try to learn how to

680
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,558
roll joints all day buy an ounce of weed

681
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,839
like that and we would just try to

682
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,960
practice rolling we were we were just

683
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:08,038
enamored with also just speaking of that

684
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,679
like I all the Growers I know roll like

685
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:11,480
this no filter just straight up weed on

686
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:13,559
the

687
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,038
tray yeah but like yeah do you want to

688
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,319
talk about like how you like your joints

689
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,679
and like basically filter I guess no

690
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:22,240
filter cuz the second you put these like

691
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,440
little pieces of paper right in your

692
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,519
mouth like that like and you're

693
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,440
breathing over it you can I can taste it

694
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,839
yeah now some people maybe can't but I'm

695
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,679
kind of tips ever I do like the glass

696
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,319
tips but they're kind of a pain in the

697
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,559
ass to you know keep clean and and have

698
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,439
a fresh one all the time and like it was

699
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,278
it if maybe if I had started smoking

700
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,640
weed like two years ago and I that's how

701
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,079
I got introduced to weed was with a

702
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,640
glass tip and all that kind of stuff

703
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,480
then maybe that's how I'd be stuck on it

704
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,440
but I learned how to roll joints where

705
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,000
you roll them properly and you th this

706
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,880
is my favorite way to smoke if it's

707
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
rolled well because when it's not you're

708
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,120
like sucking yeah you're getting bit

709
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,519
none of us have we two three joints

710
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,879
already none of us has been taking bits

711
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,278
out of our mouth I appreciate that yeah

712
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,480
it's like it's you just have to know how

713
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:09,079
to roll it with confidence that you also

714
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,519
you do the little tuck at the end that's

715
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:14,558
yeah it that's what whatever it is the

716
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,038
technique is is described as it's just

717
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:17,240
knowing that you're you're not rolling

718
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:18,960
it too tight and you're not rolling it

719
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,880
too loose it's like you've got it tight

720
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,600
enough with a little with confidence

721
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,960
where you're like this will be the right

722
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:28,158
draw and that just comes with rolling

723
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,919
like for years you know after a Time

724
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,080
some people just don't take the been

725
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,000
rolling for a long time yeah you know

726
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,038
some people just learn on that that

727
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,919
roller that zigzag made my brother two

728
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,558
little wheels you know with the piece of

729
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:43,720
fabric and like shout out to Chris you

730
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:45,720
know I'm like or cones people are

731
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,159
masters of that thing but I never really

732
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,720
[ __ ] messed with it you know like I

733
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,159
always just rolled on myself yep I've

734
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,120
been Rand since I was like 12 my brother

735
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,799
was a master he taught me how and that's

736
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:00,359
a long time ago yeah

737
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,720
yeah I learned from this like one kid in

738
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,879
high school he was like you do it like

739
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,120
this you press it all down you fold it

740
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,480
you you know pinch it down get it

741
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,199
situation situated he was like you can

742
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,159
from here he's like I can move it around

743
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,798
without even rolling it then roll it I

744
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:17,600
like oh okay I'm like and I like the no

745
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:20,038
filter thing too and you know after our

746
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,359
last interview I started rolling no

747
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:25,398
filter but then I I thought to myself

748
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:26,719
wow am am I wasting these this this

749
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:30,119
would have been a whole Summer's worth

750
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,240
of stash you know the the little roaches

751
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:35,558
you know and so I don't know sometimes

752
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,558
they're old to filter I must say yeah

753
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:41,000
but I think it's best not to you maybe

754
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,038
just for economic purposes I prefer if

755
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,640
there going to be a filter it' be a

756
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:45,278
glass one and you know if it's a nice

757
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,080
clean one it's great you know like shout

758
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,200
out to be real for I think putting that

759
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:51,480
on the map yeah um that was the first

760
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,240
time I ever saw it was there and then

761
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,079
they made the funky Fel tips and those

762
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,599
little glass tips made it so that you

763
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,278
could actually roll out a piece of

764
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,678
bubble hash and wrap it around and use

765
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:04,119
hash as a paper for the first time that

766
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,440
was like the first time we ever did that

767
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:10,839
like those people get the bottles and

768
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,159
like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh the I

769
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:14,119
don't know if those are I feel like

770
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,480
those are wasteful I've never smoked one

771
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,638
I was like that was an economical use of

772
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,200
really good hash the I've heard them

773
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:21,359
called pixie sticks they done a bunch of

774
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,600
different names but where you actually

775
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:27,079
use create a paper out of press dryft

776
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:30,959
yeah it's a little wasteful it must be

777
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:32,439
yeah you do with a group of like 18 guys

778
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,720
like we were all at the studio and we

779
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,399
were they were doing their first uh like

780
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,079
podcast shows like this it was on these

781
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:41,798
like platforms I can't remember what

782
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:43,678
they were called uh but it doesn't

783
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:44,839
matter uh it's not I don't even think it

784
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,480
exists anymore the platform but it was

785
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,359
like one of the very first ones where

786
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,120
people could go on and like broadcast

787
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,199
streaming Periscope or something some

788
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,678
crazy yeah it's like one of those early

789
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,720
ones and maybe another one that that

790
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,679
still was around at that time to but uh

791
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,440
we had a bunch of guys bunch of guys in

792
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,880
the studio cuz we're over at B real

793
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:12,480
studio and um I'd always wanted to try

794
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:14,679
it and then be had uh those glass tips

795
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,798
it was the first time that we I'd ever

796
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,038
seen them like they were using them

797
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:21,038
rolling them for Jo you're friends with

798
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:24,000
be yeah yeah for uh for a long time now

799
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,158
so that's cool yeah sometimes I just you

800
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
know have to bust out my side for sale

801
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:34,278
he first met him in like 99 or something

802
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,278
or yeah right around there it was yeah

803
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:38,798
99 or 2000 right around there but I

804
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:43,558
remember like

805
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:46,960
92 was either 92 or 93 like being 16 in

806
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:50,319
high school listening to Cypress

807
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,679
Hill I have a lot of yeah a lot of good

808
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,439
early youth memories with Cypress Hill

809
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,919
yeah like some of my early days of

810
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,600
teaching when I went to I went to

811
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,038
granard Hills High School for 10th grade

812
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:03,319
um in the valley here and that was where

813
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,839
like really it was like there were three

814
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:09,000
major bands at that time that were

815
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:11,000
dominating it was Cypress Hill tul and

816
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,798
Rage Against the Machine like that was

817
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,720
on rotation pretty much in everybody's

818
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,480
car I got into it was like one of those

819
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:23,919
what year was this this is like

820
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:26,240
93 maybe like early 94 yeah yeah yeah

821
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,120
yeah I like cyers cell more than tul and

822
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,839
uh against turned

823
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,918
it was all about the base

824
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,558
dude people would get the big Kicker

825
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,519
speaker in the back of their like Ford

826
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,960
Explorers it was just all about the

827
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:41,440
base but actually to go back to

828
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,679
finishing your question so we started

829
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,519
with stress and then uh I started

830
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,159
getting introduced to like uh Indo what

831
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:51,399
every was calling it for like these like

832
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,159
$50 eights that were amazing from Humble

833
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:55,839
and that's when I kind of realized when

834
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,000
I got enough of that that I was like oh

835
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:01,038
this weed is like way better than this

836
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,200
medication they're giving me and I don't

837
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,079
I didn't like the feeling of the

838
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,319
medication anymore cuz I was I I was

839
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,918
able to identify it yeah yeah I remember

840

843
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,240
it's indoor grown so it's Indo and they

844
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,960
would say this is Indica as

845
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:26,239
well and what is this it's more of the

846

Cherry a little Z it's good hey let me

850
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:39,918
ask you an outdoor grower question um

851
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,480
what have you learned from growing

852
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,960
outdoors in Santa Barbara well I never

853
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,039
ran those Farms but i' I've definitely

854
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,559
studied the guys that do it you know

855
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,719
when I'm there and ask a lot of

856
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:54,239
questions and

857
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:56,039
anything there's yeah for sure as far as

858
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,719
like there's great knowledge there you

859
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:01,599
know like if you know when you when

860
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:04,000

861
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,838
something like that uh or even you know

862
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,960
five to 10 or whatever it's it's a

863
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:12,320
massive canopy it's you you don't work

864
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,920
the crop the same way um it's all

865
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,200
preparation in the field before you

869
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,519
your your Irrigation in right get your

870

planting and and fertilized if you're

873
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,000
going to fertilize what do we fertilize

874
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,039
with yeah what's that what do we

875
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,280
fertilize with they were just using just

876
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,838
a base out there I don't even remember

877
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,440
what the bags were called on it it was

878
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:45,440
just some basic a stuff it was nothing

879
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,480
like no nothing special like yeah it was

880
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,599
all being grown uh to for concentrate oh

881
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,199
yeah I was going to ask like what is the

882
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,680
function of outdoor within Wonder Bread

883
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:55,719
so it's for concentrating then Edibles

884
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,118
too or yeah we would use the the same

885
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:00,078
for that too and how do the way to

886
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:02,960

TS yes yeah absolutely like in out yeah

908

the orange

910
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,719
banana uh is has always been one of our

911
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:02,199
highest like washing yield strains like

912
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:04,199
it's hit above seven in in washes and um

913

that's nice it's it's an incredible

914
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:11,239
genetic uh is most of your concentrate

915
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:13,760
uh ice water or yeah now everything is

916
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:15,639
is basically um when you see like

917
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,720
dabbable concentrates from us it's all

918
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:18,879
rosin when you have a guy like Brian

919
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:20,879

921
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,400
yeah no Brian uh let me just finish the

922
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:28,279
the the the orange banana

923
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,960
story someone can remember what this is

924
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,119
the add I've gotten better at this over

925
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,480
the years I'm should be

926
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,640
producer ability do that but yeah so the

927
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,960
the orange banana outdoor yeah so that

928
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:45,480
was the like wait for the plane uh yeah

929
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,599
that was thanks to Van airport for

930
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,920
having training fights over my house

931
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,880
damn

932
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,119
government uh no definitely like the

933
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,838
banan G and the orange banana were the

934
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,440
ones where I was like wow like you know

935
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,799
the difference is with Outdoors you have

936
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,400
these massive Fields right and the Sun

937
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,039
and all this nature and the plant just

938
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,960
becomes Hardy and it's in its natural in

939
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:13,119
state where it wants to be so it can

940
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:16,199
express I think higher tpine notes of

941
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,200
certain like markers that just don't

942
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:21,159
become more flavorful that don't come

943
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,838
out like you might indoor it might just

944
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:26,118
look like this right like these certain

945
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:31,039
ones hit their higher numbers merine or

946
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:34,400
luminol or whatever limine and um I

947
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,400
don't think luminol is a thing

948
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:41,159
actually some other one I like I think

949
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,480
that's the purple lemon are we thinking

950
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:46,480
lemon uh and then there's chinaline the

951
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,119
bad one the feel bad one yeah the haze

952
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,838
one yeah so sorry yeah go ahead let me

953
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,358
just check as when I noticed I was like

954
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:56,759
okay our orange banana indoor tastes

955
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:58,039
delicious it's really good but the uh

956
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,839
orange banana

957
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:04,480
in the outdoor field when I I was able

958
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:07,039
to take some of it when it was fresh and

959
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,559
and uh they had a space where they were

960
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,000
able to dry it where it was air

961
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,519
conditioned instead of just being in

962
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,838
like you know that's the problem with d

963
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,079
there massive fields and they don't have

964
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,880
any drying facilities so it all just

965
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,560
kind of gets hung kind of the problem

966
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,838
with the licensing structure and it's

967
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,960
really hard for these guys to have the

968
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:26,239
field just process that's a whole other

969
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,000
license you have to acquire I think that

970
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,519
it gets back not to to cut you up but I

971
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,119
think that if regulations made it easier

972
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,759
for guys to execute the guys have the

973
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,960
talent and know how to build this build

974
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,599
the [ __ ] out you know they just don't

975
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,480
have the ability to dry it and cure it

976
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:42,838
on large scale so that's why so much

977
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,559
outdoor kind of just comes out like the

978
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:49,719
way it does Colombians would bail theirs

979
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:51,960
in brown paper bag paper large 25 lb

980
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:55,239
bricks in the paper you know what I mean

981
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,599
and the paper I C when I'm tired of like

982
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:59,719
trimming and c I just stick the rest of

983
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,720
the weed in Brown Bags huh I still have

984
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:04,598
some brown bag weed that's actually

985
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:08,719
pretty good from last year I know people

986
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:11,599
who put you know brown bags in totes to

987
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:13,399
get the yeah after you've sort of done

988
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,680
your dry for the first stage of it also

989
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,880
kind of leeches the

990
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:21,598
chlorophyll who

991
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:24,240
knows not completely yeah or quickly but

992
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,160
it's anyway it cures it well interesting

993
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,759
I've never seen that never seen that

994
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,598
yeah yeah when it was the orange banana

995
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,280
though versus The Outdoor and the indoor

996
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,359
the outdoor just like every good part of

997
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,880
the indoor that I love from it was just

998
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:42,358
ex like exacerbated in the outdoor is

999
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:46,519
that orange jar orange banana um I don't

1000
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:48,960
think it is I believe this jar is

1001
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:51,318
Northern Lights uh number five the

1002
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,318
original oh so that's cool you have the

1003
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:57,358
nl5 yeah I'll roll this up too um that's

1004
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:59,920
the original cut we'll go old school w

1005
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,639
that rules

1006
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,800
that

1007
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:07,239
rules that it still smells good too yeah

1008
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,640
surprising yeah Peter that's my own

1009
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,799
string called the

1010
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,920
formio okay oh sorry so what are the

1011
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,960
what are the other two that you brought

1012
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,400
I guess I feel like we're relate in the

1013
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,559
show that we should

1014
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,318
ask

1015
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:24,440
um I think

1016
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:27,639
these I have to I have to open the

1017
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,480
look and okay so this is more Kush in

1018
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,759
here actually I think IA yeah this jar

1019
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,280
actually I think I just filled it cuz I

1020
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,760
was I needed a jar to fill up and then

1021
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,519
this one I think is the uh yeah purple

1022
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,440
papaya ruts what what is the weight of

1023
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,920
each of these jars like a seven a

1024
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,559
quarter a 1 these are actually 1 oz jars

1025
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:49,440
1 oz jars how cool yeah and uh I had a

1026
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:52,559
lot of fun designing these and uh making

1027
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,240
the the paint can look and can look and

1028
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:57,480
they I've seen other people buite the

1029
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:00,078
the can almost immediately after after

1030
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,880
you guys roll yeah I saw that too I was

1031
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,839
like I I don't mind it I'm like I'll

1032
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,240
take it as a compliment imitation is the

1033
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,279
the greatest form of FL I I heard that

1034
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,879
there's like a second Clause that's a

1035
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,000
part of that quote there is a whole

1036
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,440
second finishing of like the bit part

1037
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,358
but uh like when you sneeze God bless

1038
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,920
you but the second part is and may the

1039
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:23,519
devil miss you uh so what's the purple

1040
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,400
papaya runs that is uh run cross with

1041
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,759
Papaya oh okay straight up super

1042
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,639
straight up like like I it was just

1043
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,000
literally like okay this is you know

1044
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:37,838
runs is very popular as well as the

1045
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,719
lcg um and you know we didn't do a lot

1046
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,358
of stuff we've been very stubborn in in

1047
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:43,959
the sense of like making our own strains

1048
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,719
and our own menu and having everything

1049
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,679
be very different from everybody else's

1050
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:53,039
how about this what would you grow

1051
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:56,118
different if you didn't have to cater to

1052
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,639
the wreck Market in California and you

1053
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:00,400
could sell around the country to people

1054
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,000
who appreciate what you would want to

1055
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:07,119
grow that's a great question I think

1056
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,199
it's so I think it's really about just

1057
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,838
growing good quality mhm it it is of

1058
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:14,118
whatever strain it really is but would

1059
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:18,960
you grow some like longer flowering

1060
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:20,960
uglier looking yeah like if if

1061
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,519
economically we can make sense of it too

1062
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,280
like if the industry is in a really

1063
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,440
California is in a tough state right now

1064
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:34,559
like prices are are are totally changed

1065
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,760
um the cost of operating the taxes like

1066
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,200
the the economy is not in a great state

1067
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,960
either like a lot of people aren't

1068
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:44,199
spending money on flour as much as they

1069
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,559
were uh there was a lot of excess money

1070
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:49,358
running around when you know the

1071
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,200
pandemic was was going and before that

1072
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,679
too the economy was Stronger before the

1073
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:55,719
pandemic started I think as well so

1074
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,078
people were spending more and now

1075
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:01,919
there's just a very

1076
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,280
like the black market is expanded cuz it

1077
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,880
there's I think it was a great

1078
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,800
opportunity for them you know to be like

1079
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,200
like the stores are 38% tax the flower

1080
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,480
cost you know more all this packaging

1081
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,799
all this testing people have been

1082
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,760
smoking weed and buying weed from their

1083
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,720
friends and you know having it brought

1084
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,160
to them while they're just hanging out

1085
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,879
on the couch like they don't have to go

1086
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:25,719
to the store you anyone like that they

1087
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,800
never met anyone like that they're

1088
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,239
mostly myths you know don't even exist

1089
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,119
anymore mythical people yes like

1090
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,759
leprechauns

1091
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,440
and that's just kind of an Testament to

1092
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,880
what the the weed Market should probably

1093
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,920
be it should be so loose and LAX that

1094
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,119
you can just sell it from your house

1095
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,800
maybe you should still have to have some

1096
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,599
testing on it you know and testing can

1097
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,800
come down in pricing if it's on a larger

1098
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:51,720
scale so that there's access to safe cuz

1099
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,720
the best thing about recreational weed

1100
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:57,399
was the fact that the testing you know

1101
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,919
like at the very least now whether the

1102
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,519
numbers are cooked on THC or not yeah

1103
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,358
like the heavy metal contents like those

1104
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:07,079
things are yeah like pesticides and like

1105
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:08,598
that having clean weed is was probably

1106
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,960
the best thing that came out of all of

1107
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:13,280
that cuz everybody was doing crazy [ __ ]

1108
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,318
before that the peak of Happiness was

1109
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,760
pre

1110
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:21,079
2018 so there you had 20 TS no no no no

1111
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,480
you you had a lot less I mean it was

1112
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:28,240
testing was going on yeah but then you

1113
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:32,280
also had like people could grow at home

1114
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:34,759
and get it in the shops right 2007 to

1115
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,000
2012 yeah there's a lot of gray area

1116
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,319
like I was very skeptical of like this

1117
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,079
is just some measure D prop D was

1118
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,279
2012 I was like they're just going to

1119
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,599
get everybody to give them their info

1120
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,000
and then come arrest them or something

1121
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:48,400
so it was like I never signed up for

1122
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,280
licenses yeah early on it was

1123
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,480
regrettable because the people that did

1124
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,640
got you know grandfathered in they they

1125
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,880
actually probably like one of the very

1126
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:01,960
few groups that actually maybe yeah made

1127
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,599
money I was pre yeah like made money

1128
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:09,960
during you know the the Cannabis history

1129
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:12,280
over the past 20 years um and

1130
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,760
um you know they they provided a good

1131
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,119
service but it was a really great area I

1132
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,040
mean You' basically you'd have shops

1133
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:20,599
that had phony paperwork you had shops

1134
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:23,759
that maybe had real paperwork these ones

1135
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:25,720
would get rided one day this one would

1136
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,720
there was a federal agent going around

1137
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:29,679
raing legal places and telling them they

1138
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:32,039
had three days to shut down yeah they

1139
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,679
were threatening you know landlords that

1140
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,759
they would seize their property at one

1141
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:40,558
point if they you know didn't evict the

1142
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,599
the tenants yeah there was all types of

1143
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,640
you know all types of weird hurdles that

1144
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,519
that Canabis has been thrown over the

1145
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:49,920
years people being able to operate

1146
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:51,039
safely is another benefit of totally

1147
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,519
it's that's one of the things that

1148
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:54,599
attracted me have changed yeah was

1149
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,400
definitely one of the big things that

1150
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,318
attracted me I was like I'd been you

1151
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,720
know you're just looking over your

1152
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,159
shoulder for so many years you're just

1153
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,078
like I'm so tired you don't even have to

1154
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:08,598
look in the mirror anymore yeah now you

1155
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:10,119
know now you you know you're like okay

1156
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:12,920
we're we're doing everything we possibly

1157
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:14,358
can to be legal and operate and you go

1158
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,358
home at night and feel comfortable and

1159
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:21,318
sleep and not be worried about like you

1160
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:24,519
know some kind of you know legal uh

1161
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:27,400
problem yep and remember always looking

1162
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:30,599
in the rearview mirror always

1163
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:34,000
and I you know that comes from earlier

1164
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:36,200
paranoia parano you guys

1165
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,358

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:54,680
buddy yep Rick was a cool

1215
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,160
guy I so that's the nl5 which is super

1216
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:58,078
and so you're doing like a lot of

1217
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:01,519
genetic work now in making seeds and

1218
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,160
selling seeds but you're also like doing

1219
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,199
archival type work and bringing out

1220
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:07,118
stuff like the nl5 so what's the future

1221
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:10,679
look

1222
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:13,760
like hunting new stuff yeah creating new

1223
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:16,558
with old um like right now I just pop

1224
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,040
seeds like of my blueberry strain

1225
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,200
crossed with the NL so I'm be like I

1226
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:23,880
feel like these two TPS

1227
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:27,159
can uh you know complement each other in

1228
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:31,119
a unique way and create like like the is

1229
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:33,399
such a a high U blueberry cross with no

1230
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,200
it's just nl5 right this is nl5 what is

1231
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,200
nl5 uh the original cut of Northern

1232
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:40,159
Lights uh number five from like the

1233
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:42,759
early 90s this was I don't think I've

1234
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,838
ever trains that I ever smoked in high

1235
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,799
school that I was like this was like a

1236
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:49,199
branded strain at that point like the

1237
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:51,199
name it the strain had a name people

1238
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,558
were going crazy for it this is this was

1239
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:53,798
10th grade for me right here well I

1240
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,640
didn't realize that like the numbers

1241
00:50:53,798 --> 00:50:57,960
were different crosses like I thought

1242
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,920
they were just different fenos but I

1243
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,079
guess each NL is its own like the one is

1244
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,599
a different props from the two from the

1245
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:08,519
five from the 10 they're all their

1246
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,920
own yeah and and when when I first got

1247
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,440
it here in the valley when I was going

1248
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,440
to Granada in 10th Grade it was actually

1249
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:18,559
Hawaiian NL Hawaiian NL number five is

1250
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,000
what they called it and uh now I don't

1251
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,880
know if someone put the Hawaiian name on

1252
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,199
it just for like for the sake of doing

1253
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:30,240
it or was it really a Hawaiian NL cross

1254
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,719
at that point too interesting I mean I

1255
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:34,479
I've heard that same story that other

1256
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:37,598
people were getting that I had some that

1257
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,960
Hawaiian in the days Hawaiian was just

1258
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,599
fire killer yeah I had a friend of mine

1259
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:46,798
that used to get it we will not mention

1260
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:49,519
his name um and uh no two ounces were

1261
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:53,798

amazing yeah that that was I think one

1269
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,798
of the appeals to cannabis too as you

feel

1291
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,920
like it's going to be a few there there

1292
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:12,119
a few lanes right there's the lane of

1293
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,960
like the people that are breeding to

1294
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,559
just create

1295
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:19,079
biomass right that are like we we create

1296
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:23,760
these strains that are really

1297
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:26,880
vigorous um high yielders and and

1298
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,079
numeric Sten T high THC yeah yeah all of

1299
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,519
the the metrics based stuff right where

1300
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:35,720
you're just like it's an like yeah

1301
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:37,318
anybody can grow it and but it's like

1302
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:38,399
does anybody really like it you know

1303
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:41,000
like a lot of

1304
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,599
times it can be done like I personally

1305
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,400
believe that like my new version of of

1306
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,760
the blueberry which started with like

1307
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,160
blueberry my first Beyond blueberry in

1308
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:53,839
like

1309
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:57,399
2015 uh that I crossed with the ozk mail

1310
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:59,880
became uh bzk then we cross cross that

1311
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:04,400
uh with

1312
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:08,119
um uh cookies and cream ozk mail went

1313
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:12,440
into that bzk to make uh the next

1314
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:14,880
version of the like the bzk 2.0 and uh

1315
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,440
is this all written down on a

1316
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,720
chart yeah I should I should write it

1317
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,679
down on a chart really yeah I it might

1318
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:24,519
be like compan history yeah it might be

1319
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,798
in the company stuff like the F we have

1320
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:30,400
a pretty large uh Google drive with

1321
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:32,719
everything we've created yeah that rules

1322
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,639
so it's like a I can go and look at it

1323
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,919
but it's like it would take me a long

1324
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:38,039
time to try to find that but I should

1325
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,519
write it down and just put on the

1326
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:42,838
website like a lineage

1327
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:45,559
chart that'd be amazing cuz it went from

1328
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:47,480
that cookies and cream ozk mail cuz I

1329
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:49,359
when I did that first round with the

1330
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,519
mail of the

1331
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:53,880
ozk I was still early on in the breeding

1332
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,920
process like I was saying I only used

1333
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,838
that mail once I didn't think that I

1334
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,079
should keep this mail as a as a cut a

1335
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,239
clone off of it and keep that mail

1336
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,720
forever because if I would have the

1337
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:07,279
everything that came from that was just

1338
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,358
Epic from that male right now the things

1339
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,680
that came from that I found really good

1340
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,880
males out of all those things too but

1341
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,440
that one male was very special like it's

1342
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,318
funny a lot of people's one that got

1343
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,679
away

1344
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:22,838
is often a female not a not a male

1345
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:25,318
that's that's super cool yeah yeah uh

1346
00:55:22,838 --> 00:55:27,119
I've been pretty good at uh keeping the

1347
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:30,199
genetics we haven't really lost anything

1348
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,880
you collect pollen no I've never really

1349
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:36,759
kept the pollen I just do the seeds mhm

1350
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:39,599
um pollen is like so small amount it's

1351
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,319
hard to to see it and then you put it in

1352
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,318
the freezer I mean I tried once and then

1353
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:45,038
I was like I don't know if this is going

1354
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:47,558
to work and then like a year there's no

1355
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:49,760
real like expert around there telling

1356
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:52,920
you how to handle pollen and freeze it

1357
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,240
properly um does it get Frozen I mean I

1358
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,318
think that's how you have to store it is

1359
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:57,959
as you freeze it yeah but like you stick

1360
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:02,358
get in a glass jar and freeze it is what

1361
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:04,679
I did and uh I don't know yeah I mean

1362
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:06,000
did you ever try to use it fall I I did

1363
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:07,558
throw it on a plant I don't I don't

1364
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,559
think it worked yeah you know but the

1365
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,000
problem is it doesn't throw it sticks to

1366
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:14,880
the it's like static like just sticks to

1367
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,440
whatever it is if you yes it does side

1368
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,680
of the bag whatever yeah so you kind of

1369
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,000
have to like take yeah like a brush or

1370
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:22,759
whatever it is and try to get it on

1371
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,960
there and even I was like taking the the

1372
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:28,559
jar and like swirling it on the you know

1373
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,720
like on that on like like I was covering

1374
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,039
the whole plant with it

1375
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:36,679
um yeah and you know what I heard

1376
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:40,200
something about bees having the opposite

1377
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:41,679
um charge of pollen and which makes it

1378
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:44,679
stick to them or something like that

1379
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,639
suck it up their legs that Mak sense

1380
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:48,719
makes a lot of sense you know they're

1381
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,639
the masters of pollen they we need more

1382
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,399
bees yeah uh so when you're making your

1383
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:55,078
seeds it sounds like you're you've

1384
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,960
almostly talked about working with males

1385
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,400
and making R so you're not not doing fem

1386
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,519
or reversals no I haven't done that yet

1387
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,639
um I do want to get into it for just

1388
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:06,880
certain preservation aspects to say okay

1389
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:09,679
here's a to lock something in yeah in

1390
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,798
that in that time and space of what it

1391
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:15,118
is you know like um not to lock it in

1392
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:17,559
for the sense of that it was perfect and

1393
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,720
I just there's no what there's no better

1394
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:22,119
this string can get because I feel like

1395
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:25,199
you can always kind of from what I've

1396
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:28,680
seen I've been able to chase Tarpin and

1397
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:31,919
move a that tpine from through multiple

1398
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:34,159
genetic processes and carry that tpine

1399
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,039
over into like five six breeding

1400
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,838
projects later and get all the fenos

1401
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,720
that I want so you get that perfect one

1402
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:43,279
but it takes time like like that's why I

1403
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:46,679
say our blueberry is one of those ones

1404
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:49,000
right now where after I did the ozk

1405
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:51,639
cookies and cream mail into that pheno

1406
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,679
hunted that found the most blueberry one

1407
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:55,798
of that and every one of those things I

1408
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:58,639
was talking about before and then also

1409
00:57:55,798 --> 00:58:00,599
then cross it into the GDP oh very Co

1410
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:02,558
right so then that added like something

1411
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:05,079
else to it oh and the GDP is something

1412
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,880
you still holds uh I don't have it

1413
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:10,200
anymore because it it just is it's a

1414
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,920
finicky plant really was and it was just

1415
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:14,159
there was no demand to it and I still

1416
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,838
have like Original Seed packs so I was

1417
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,960
like if I'm going to do it I'll go for

1418
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:19,599
the seed pack again cuz the cut was

1419
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,599
weakened at that point and there wasn't

1420
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,400
really a whole lot of tissue culture

1421
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,880
stuff and tissue culture to me is still

1422
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,559
kind of on the fence whether it's good

1423
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:31,119
or bad so you're not doing tissue

1424
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,160
culture I have stuff backed up in tissue

1425
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,838
culture I was just wondering

1426
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:37,798
so like stuff comes out of it after

1427
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:38,920
you've that it just kind of changes your

1428
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:41,400
strain a little

1429
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,559
bit now some strains I think it does it

1430
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,880
to more than others and other strains it

1431
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:48,039
doesn't affect as much so at what point

1432
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,680
are you going to be fenal hunting in the

1433
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:53,240
plant's

1434
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:55,719
growth always feno hunting even when it

1435
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:57,399
before it buds on the stem you do you

1436
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:59,439
smell stems oh are you talking about

1437
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:03,200
like at what point do you start coling

1438
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:06,000
no looking for like a special resiny you

1439
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:09,078
know or punch into I like I rub the

1440
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,440
stems before they flower in veg always

1441
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:13,680
I'm rubbing I'm trying to pick up notes

1442
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,720
even early on and like and that was what

1443
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:19,199
was so unique about like the ozk when I

1444
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:21,519
was doing the ozk the first time there's

1445
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:23,919
no other way to do the mail well is

1446
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:26,599
there no well you can you could go for

1447
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,079
traits as far as Vigor yeah

1448
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:31,079
but I'd already been growing the

1449
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:33,119
Skittles before I got the seed pack

1450
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:35,200
right so when I rubbed this the Skittles

1451
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,599
stock it to me it

1452
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:42,399
has like a Savory Menthol type tone to

1453
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:45,440
it like there's something very

1454
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,200
like to yeah something there that I

1455
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:51,119
associate with Menthol yep um and then

1456
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:54,399
when I was doing the feno hunt on the

1457
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,358
ozk even the the keeper pheno that we

1458
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,960
had like it was I think it was the the

1459
00:59:56,358 --> 00:59:59,838
the

1460
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,599
O3 was the the one we that that we've

1461
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:05,400
kept forever is and um and then the male

1462
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,640
they both had crazy

1463
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,798
Skittles uh in the stock rub just like

1464
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:14,159
how the Skittles Did so I had something

1465
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:16,639
I could AB to you know and compare you

1466
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,759
know and uh those stood out so yeah for

1467
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:19,838
sure like but yeah when you're breeding

1468
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,119
you're definitely you're going to rub

1469
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:24,400
the stocks you're going to try to

1470
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,798
identify the those crazy turbs but

1471
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,480
you're also it's not the only thing like

1472
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:29,400
sometimes it totally changes on you and

1473
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,599
or there's something that's just

1474
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:36,519
undetectable till it's finished Y and

1475
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,838
um and then this sometimes the Vigor or

1476
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:42,759
the yield of something you know

1477
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:44,279
like you know you might you might make a

1478
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,440
cross like

1479
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:49,359
um like the ozk cookies and cream like

1480
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,318
from what we did and there are ones that

1481
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:55,358
were super turpy that wouldn't wash

1482
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:57,960
right like how you know a very turpy

1483
01:00:55,358 --> 01:01:01,279
string can be is you want more of that

1484
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:04,199
Sandy dry sort of more greasy yeah when

1485
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:07,599
it's greasy it's great for BHO when it's

1486
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:09,598
when it's uh you know drer drier it's

1487
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,838
for your you want that for your rosin is

1488
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,039
is one of the signs of of testing and

1489
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:16,960
looking at things and that seems to have

1490
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:19,359
held up over the years as a an approach

1491
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,639
of philosophy to to detect how things

1492
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:23,279
will turn out and I think it makes some

1493
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:26,279
intuitive sense you're like heads that

1494
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,079
are less inclined to burst yeah are less

1495
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,839
inclined to bur yeah and then there's

1496
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:32,839
all the whole thing about how things are

1497
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:35,440
frozen and handled and processed without

1498
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:38,798
damaging all the heads too but uh I

1499
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,639
think in an ideal world like for washers

1500
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:43,960
and BHO guys that you would want to keep

1501
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:47,118
like two of the top fenos that are

1502
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,838
really similar but perform better one

1503
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:52,200
performs better in BHO and one performs

1504
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:55,318
better in a solventless wash and still

1505
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:56,480
actually put a ratio of one to the other

1506
01:01:55,318 --> 01:01:58,639
together

1507
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,358
and get a blend so it's like yeah you

1508
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,358
know what this one only washes at like

1509
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:04,960
one and a half% but it has a crazy tur

1510
01:02:02,358 --> 01:02:09,920
profile on it it's more turp and this

1511
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:11,559
one is hitting your 5% and uh has a a

1512
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,159
good tur profile too but the two

1513
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:15,880
together will make something even better

1514
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,358
you know and knowing that that you're

1515
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:20,480
selecting fenos that taste the same you

1516
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:23,119
know that they're very similar that when

1517
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:27,079
they combine they still don't they just

1518
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:30,599
add to each other you know like um

1519
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:33,318
and how many runs from clone and are you

1520
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:33,318
making these

1521
01:02:34,278 --> 01:02:41,480
decisions uh so typically

1522
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:43,278
like a lot of people that are breeding

1523
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:46,719
or that are that are running from seed

1524
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:48,199
packs MH um they'll B be buying tons of

1525
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:49,639
seed and just be planning outside and

1526
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:51,960
they just have crazy varieties and doing

1527
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:53,598
big outdoor or they'll buy like designer

1528
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,519
packs like high-end packs like I'm

1529
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:58,119
trying to create these you know our bird

1530
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:02,239
seed line and and have really unique

1531
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:04,480
genetics um but the way I do things is I

1532
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:07,000
I grow up from the seed the plant I cut

1533
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,559
a clone off of it or maybe two or three

1534
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,639
or whatever then I throw that Original

1535
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:14,079
Seed away so you don't even flower out

1536
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:17,960
the top R your plant no okay it's it's a

1537
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:19,680
it's a waste of time yeah um feminized

1538
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,159
what's that are they feminized no not

1539
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:25,838
fiz oh well no and the reason I say it's

1540
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:28,159
a waste of time uh for me now if if you

1541
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:30,318
a big field that one plant is going to

1542
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:32,519
perform really unique and it's only

1543
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:34,558
going to perform that way that one time

1544
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:37,559
mhm after you cut the Clone off of that

1545
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:39,400
and you're like you you take that clone

1546
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:41,839
and you flower out that clone it doesn't

1547
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:44,000
look and perform the same way so if

1548
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:46,759
you're trying to take data that says hey

1549
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,639
this plant gets three 6 ounces of plant

1550
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:52,760
or something like that and it grows this

1551
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:54,920
way like the the seed versus the Clone

1552
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:57,160
is are going to be different right so

1553
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,400
you're if you're looking to have

1554
01:03:57,159 --> 01:04:00,679
something that's going to last a long

1555
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,798
time and not just run it once so you can

1556
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:05,078
actually be searching through the seeds

1557
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,440
for something interesting it's it's that

1558
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:09,000
first run from GL cuz I heard some

1559
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:11,278
people even try to say that things

1560
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,400
stable out

1561
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:17,798
over stabil out stabilize out more over

1562
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:20,880
time yeah um that's why land races are

1563
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:23,599
very similar like pretty much Thai used

1564
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,880
to be Thai and it had the Thai smell and

1565
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:30,680
taste it could be grown better or worse

1566
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,599
but it was the same plant and flavor

1567
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:35,000
that's why it's like OG Kush was a

1568
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:37,960
perfect example of that type of test

1569
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,559
experiment on a large scale because so

1570
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:43,519
many people eventually got the OG cut

1571
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:46,079
we're all growing OG cush mhm and

1572
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,759
uh you would see it just look different

1573
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,278
from place to place because of everybody

1574
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,760
even though we're all growing in the

1575
01:04:49,278 --> 01:04:56,278
valley here or in Hollywood or Lancaster

1576
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,039
or san berardino is like you could tell

1577
01:04:56,278 --> 01:04:59,480
it was OG but everybody's OG looked

1578
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:01,359
different just because of the

1579
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,920
microclimates of everybody's different

1580
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:05,679
room the little differences of water

1581
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,720
well you mentioned it earlier that's how

1582
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:09,639
so many of the different like phenos

1583
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:12,399
were birthed of

1584
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:14,759
OG it was just like this batch was this

1585
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:18,240
way so we're calling it this and then

1586
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:21,278
this batch and was all the same cut yeah

1587
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:23,639
totally I mean if you had a legit cut or

1588
01:05:21,278 --> 01:05:26,000
a descendant of the legit cut you know

1589
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:28,838
well then there were all the s1s yeah

1590
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,278
there was fire too for sure yeah and

1591
01:05:28,838 --> 01:05:32,639
then you had stuff that like DNA

1592
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:34,880
genetics did with like Kosher Kush I

1593
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,639
think and which is I love the

1594
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,440
Kosar yeah those were all great strains

1595
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:41,400
like um so you brought up DNA a couple

1596
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,679
of times are they sort of like what

1597
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:47,440
breeders did you look up to or did you

1598
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,679
definitely DNA were the first that like

1599
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,599
I was maybe just at a different there's

1600
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,480
these other seed companies out there

1601
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,359
that were around like Mr nice or I I'm

1602
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,760
not e I wasn't in East Coast I didn't

1603
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:59,598
see that and I was maybe too young to

1604
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,599
see that in the 80s so when the '90s

1605
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:04,680
rolled

1606
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:06,640
around um that is what I saw you know

1607
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:08,199
DNA

1608
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:11,798
uh

1609
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:15,439
and you know maybe it was not even the

1610
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:18,358
'90s and more maybe early 2000s even cuz

1611
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:21,720
I didn't really start buying

1612
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:24,358
seeds so probably like after

1613
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:27,239
2005 you know was like I would just find

1614
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:29,440
bag seeds yeah yeah wow you know like

1615
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:31,239
you know when I got bubble gum I bought

1616
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,278
enough Bubble Gum to where I found a

1617
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:35,318
really good bag seat of it and I it

1618
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:37,480
turned out just like bubblegum I that's

1619
01:06:35,318 --> 01:06:40,759
one of the ones

1620
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:43,199
really what the bubblegum your your yeah

1621
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:46,079
it's cool I've popped a couple bubble

1622
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:48,000
gummy things from bog old seeds they

1623
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:52,240
never they just don't really want to

1624
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:55,760
live yeah yeah um but it's a cool tur

1625
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:58,879
yeah I really like sweet powdery you

1626
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:02,240
know bubblegum like do do some do some

1627
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,039
of your strains grow better Outdoors

1628
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,558
than

1629
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,960
others or they're all I would say yeah I

1630
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:10,519
would say that

1631
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,760
um almost like under the right

1632
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:14,239
conditions right with a healthy plant

1633
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,960
going outside I feel like the outdoor is

1634
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:19,078
going to perform better tpine profile

1635
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:22,159
every time if it's a if it's a good year

1636
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:24,880
of weather Southern California Sun as an

1637
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,159
example yeah but what I was asking is

1638
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,559
like

1639
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:33,038
if have you seen a difference

1640
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:37,119
in how the plants grow from strain to

1641
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:40,400
strain yeah like each genetic is vastly

1642
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:43,760
different like our pink Picasso is slow

1643
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:46,559
in veg uhhuh like you can get it to go

1644
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,599
faster by using a smaller Cube like on

1645
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:52,359
indoor like instead of vegging it in a

1646
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:54,039
six like if you veg it in a 2x4 it it'll

1647
01:07:52,358 --> 01:07:56,000
stretch and get a little bigger faster

1648
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:59,920
and is that just like it just

1649
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,440
has that from the Z probably yeah you

1650
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,318
know and cookies as well wasn't like a a

1651
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:07,000
fast oh right there's the Candy Land in

1652
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:09,400
it too yeah yeah very cool so none of

1653
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,079
those were like vigorous fast vegging

1654
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,519
plants whereas like if I do that with

1655
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:17,159
our you know using a smaller Cube versus

1656
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:19,520
a bigger cube in veg will always result

1657
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:20,920
whatever strain to speed up a little bit

1658
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,080
and and get a little bigger faster more

1659
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,199
space you give it yeah it's like uh no

1660
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:27,119
it's it's actually the smaller and it's

1661
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:29,399
it's it's counterintuitive to basic

1662
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:32,599
logic but it's I think it has to do with

1663
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:36,158
the dry Downs in a 4in cube yeah like a

1664
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:38,719
four like a 4 in 2 in X4 or 4x4

1665
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,960
Cube it can only hold so much water and

1666
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:43,719
the plant actually uses what's kind of

1667
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,759
there whereas if you're in a six it's

1668
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:48,439
like this small little plant can't drink

1669
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:52,399
that whole Cube and and nor does the

1670
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:55,798
cube like naturally perspire out right

1671
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:59,238
enough water to like give it the right

1672
01:08:55,798 --> 01:09:02,319
environment for the for like rapid

1673
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:03,879
growth early on as you put the Clone in

1674
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:06,719
it's like when you put a clone into a

1675
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:09,759
six or a eight that's coming from a 1in

1676
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:12,158
cube like you going to get a slower veg

1677
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,119
that first week until like the plant

1678
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,399
adapts to it or it could be even two

1679
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:17,479
weeks depending if you're really

1680
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:20,158
overwatering which is something you're

1681
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:22,238
going to run into potentially easily

1682
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:24,278
easier with a bigger cube and a smaller

1683
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:26,639
plant and so and all of your stuff is

1684
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:29,000
grown in Cube

1685
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:32,520
yeah everything that uh we've ever grown

1686
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,880
is is been for our indoor line yeah has

1687
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,799
been uh in Rockwell in Rockwell yeah and

1688
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,000
then if it's for our concentrates and

1689
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:43,278
our vape pens and stuff like that it's

1690
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:46,439
come from outdoor very cool and then

1691
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:50,120
um yeah I guess I but there's no but is

1692
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:51,479
there any flower from the outdoor no I

1693
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:55,559
smoked all of

1694
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:57,718
it it is it's like the for flow it's

1695
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,199
week I take a few ounces of it when we

1696
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:02,119
have it you know and then it's like the

1697
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:05,119
rest of it going to go into the freezer

1698
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:08,800
yeah back to my original question did

1699
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:11,960
outdoor in Santa Barbara did which was

1700
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,440
the best growing strain that was I think

1701
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,920
what I was trying to get out it was

1702
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:17,119
there a Best growing strand or yeah

1703
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,960
there's ones that perform pretty crazy

1704
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,319
like

1705
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,679
um our melon

1706
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:28,479
OG uh would just be like these like Half

1707
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,679
Dome Circles of and without even topping

1708
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,198
it or anything I mean get Spears yeah it

1709
01:10:30,679 --> 01:10:34,560
would just be it would just be made up

1710
01:10:32,198 --> 01:10:36,799
of nothing but the spears shooting out

1711
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,239
of it and it's it almost looked like

1712
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,679
somebody came in and shaped it into

1713
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:44,039
these Half Dome circles like almost

1714
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,158
perfect half circles and they'd be maybe

1715
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:48,640
five six feet wide and what is the melan

1716
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:52,679
OG melan OG was from seed packs that

1717
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:55,039
were given to me by Karma uh Karma Squad

1718
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:57,359
oh right yeah yeah the melon they haveon

1719
01:10:55,039 --> 01:11:00,760
so hunted like two packs of theirs found

1720
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:04,079
a really good melon OG that was vigorous

1721
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:06,239
and and uh it was a great washer too

1722
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:08,359
yeah yeah so I BR with that to make

1723
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:11,599
washing strains as well too for the bird

1724
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:15,399
line seed that rules yeah yeah yeah that

1725
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:18,480
karma karma every year still in Vogue

1726
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:21,359
still the coolest yeah no he he does you

1727
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:24,119
know really good projects they're large

1728
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:26,198
scale and they take their time cuz they

1729
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:29,198
they have all that ability there so

1730
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:31,799
that's what it helps a lot too like if

1731
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:33,879
you are working with very modest means

1732
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,560
you have to be very selective about what

1733
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,159
you're doing and if you're working with

1734
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,600
mass scale you can be like yeah you know

1735
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:43,599
what we can do you know 30 to 100

1736
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,800
different tests right if you if you have

1737
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,639
the infrastructure to support it all yes

1738
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:50,159
we all dream of that it would be nice

1739
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:52,760
careful what you wish for something what

1740
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,679
is it you have with you see was okay so

1741
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,239
uh these are like the newest drops that

1742
01:11:54,679 --> 01:12:02,000
just came out on the uh birdseed uh

1743
01:11:57,238 --> 01:12:05,000
genetics.com and also on um uh Neptune

1744
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,198
so we just got the seeds so they are we

1745
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:12,079
going to put them up on the FCP seed

1746
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:14,879
bank uh yeah sure let's do it I'm of

1747
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:16,559
course I want to share seeds with the

1748
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,800
world and a lot of the Creations that

1749
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:22,560
I've created so this is the that nl5

1750
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:25,360
cross with u our jzk 15 which is the

1751
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,159
chloroform which is actually

1752
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:31,158
I actually don't have it in here right

1753
01:12:27,158 --> 01:12:33,719
now but uh that is the jealousy cross

1754
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:36,799
with the Kush Cola okay so gelousy cush

1755
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:40,880
Cola made a really unique uh like

1756
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:44,199
gassier version of the um the Kush does

1757
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,920
it go kind of shy the way um it's it's

1758
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:50,119
got that Cola Cherry turp but it's just

1759
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:52,158
like a a much like almost like just

1760
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:53,359
really gassy is all I can say is and

1761
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:55,599
that's why I kind of went with the

1762
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,639
chloroform name because I was like o you

1763
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:02,520
know you're just like it's one of those

1764
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:05,880
ones that is is very you know uh fumy

1765
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,600
the train row or no like that's more of

1766
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:10,119
the tendine thing that I was talking

1767
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,679
about earlier I'm not into yeah it's

1768
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:13,319
more of like

1769
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,600
the

1770
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:18,799
like um I don't know it's like mercy and

1771
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:21,920
yeah it's like a it's like a fuel like a

1772
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,760
like a fume fuel gas that reminds me

1773
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,880
when I would go to like a hair salon and

1774
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,800
like when when I was a kid and like be

1775
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,079
like uh my mom would get your hair done

1776
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,039
and they'd all be doing like this this

1777
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:35,679
chemical for their hair it was like I

1778
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:37,719
was like how could they handle that I'm

1779
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,319
like holy [ __ ] you know what I mean it

1780
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:41,920
reminds me of that so there's like those

1781
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:44,719
latexy rubbery like Botti kind of has

1782
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,199
that yeah yeah yeah so it's very

1783
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:51,039
offensive in that side so that's the NL

1784
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:52,638
cross to that yeah and these all uh

1785
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:54,600
these two there's there's two of them

1786
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,840
that have that cross right now so Kush

1787
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,120
Cola C

1788
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,400
which was the wedding cake uh and the

1789
01:13:58,119 --> 01:14:01,359
Kush Cola so that's like a more like

1790
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,479
powdery

1791
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:06,960
sugary Cherry Cola yeah right and then

1792
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:10,119
this is roadkill cookies which is the

1793
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:12,920
the GMO with the orange banana Picasso

1794
01:14:10,119 --> 01:14:14,439
that's the male so the orange banana is

1795
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,359
again like one of the highest washers

1796
01:14:14,439 --> 01:14:20,198
that we've ever you know come across and

1797
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:22,119
uh crossed out with the pink Picasso um

1798
01:14:20,198 --> 01:14:24,238
into that male into the pink Picasso got

1799
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:25,840
the orange Picasso use the orange

1800
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:31,279
Picasso male

1801
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,279
into the GMO to make this like

1802
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:37,238
Road totally cool yeah there's there's

1803
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:39,279
some real gas in here and then this is

1804
01:14:37,238 --> 01:14:41,678
one I haven't put out yet called Theta

1805
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:44,920
uh this is our Beyond blueberry uh with

1806
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:46,960
the oie Kush cross with of gak so very

1807
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:51,840
cool and the gak also from ding bre no

1808
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:54,039
the gak is um I think it was from heds

1809
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,400
oh like okay yeah I there was a group of

1810
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:58,519
guys that that had that g strain and

1811
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,960
they were all putting it out at the same

1812
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:03,520
time for some reason like it seemed like

1813
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:07,158
I think it was maybe massive another guy

1814
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:10,159
and uh uh ding breed I think also had

1815
01:15:07,158 --> 01:15:12,920
like gak variations and stuff like that

1816
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:15,879
so very cool that one I bet there's some

1817
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:19,079
real winners in there yeah I mean I've

1818
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:22,520
been very fortunate like uh I've been

1819
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:23,960
breeding with very uh unique strains

1820
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:26,159
that I've been able to either create

1821
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:28,359
myself or get you know find and get

1822
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:32,559
gifted or are floating around and

1823
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:35,799
they're accessible um so I I'm I'm not

1824
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:39,400
really just playing with genetics that

1825
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:42,320
are uh random right like I'm picking

1826
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:45,759
very specific things for specific

1827
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:48,599
reasons cuz I think that these two types

1828
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,760
of tpin are going to work well together

1829
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:54,440
um and then there your reputation

1830
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:55,679
precedes you appreciate that thank you

1831
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:57,960
uh

1832
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:00,719
as an appreciator of Wonder but buds

1833
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,920
from way back it's that's a very nice

1834
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,520
compliment um and I I I I really do

1835
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:09,359
appreciate that because it's nice to

1836
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:11,760
know that the all these things that I do

1837
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:15,719
you know behind closed doors kind of

1838
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,920
just I'm not showing them but I'm it's I

1839
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:20,480
need to get better at at filming myself

1840
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,719
and and creating content um but I just

1841
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:24,519
find myself like doing something and

1842
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:27,000
then I'm halfway through it and I forgot

1843
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,320
to turn on the camera right and so I'm

1844
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,399
like well I'm not going to go back and

1845
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:32,439
recreate the front half and you know

1846
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:35,079
like just going to just finish this off

1847
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:37,839
and do that describe Peter wor nightmare

1848
01:16:35,079 --> 01:16:39,439
yeah so it that's it's one of my faults

1849
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,079
like I just start fiddling with

1850
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:44,000
something and then 30 minutes later I

1851
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:47,079
kind of have something and or I've done

1852
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,359
something or whatever and um but a lot

1853
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:50,238
of times with the breeding process

1854
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:53,519
though the tpine selections are very

1855
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:56,839
deliberate like with that kush

1856
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:59,560
Cola I was isn't going to breed ozk with

1857
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,639
something like GMO which is actually

1858
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,080
ended up turning out to be a pretty

1859
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:03,119
decent cross out there which I've seen I

1860
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,920
think one of the people call it's the

1861
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,719
high frequ corn syrup or whatever

1862
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,639
something like that there is a feno of

1863
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,560
it that turned out pretty good but

1864
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:13,920
intuitively for the way that I normally

1865
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,440
approach things um I'll try to take

1866
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:20,319
something that

1867
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:23,879
is uh like Fruity or not so recessively

1868
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:26,039
dominant that o k or a skittles TP or a

1869
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,119
sweet turp profile like that has the

1870
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:31,279
ability to blend together versus just

1871
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:33,559
creating something weird that doesn't

1872
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,198
really have a great flavor or like or

1873
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:38,840
just gets weird and just goes into like

1874
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:40,359
this like it almost defaults into like a

1875
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,719
a citrus flavor that you don't

1876
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:45,399
appreciate or like M you know like I'll

1877
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,719
find that that you know you can find all

1878
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:48,119
these different fenos into something

1879
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,600
that are really good but then there'll

1880
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:54,000
be that weird one you're like that's is

1881
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:58,280
just gross tpine of some kind of I had a

1882
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,639
z thing yesterday that like this was

1883
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:02,639
like tomato water almost and I was like

1884
01:18:00,639 --> 01:18:05,199
just like yeah there's wrong selection

1885
01:18:02,639 --> 01:18:07,840
yeah totally you're like that does not

1886
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:10,198
sound good at any even like if

1887
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,800
tomato even tomato water doesn't taste

1888
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:13,678
good you know like yeah no I don't know

1889
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,760
they were it's it's you know it's

1890
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,399
citrusy and it was there was a littleit

1891
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,719
Tangi thing there but it was kind of it

1892
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:21,799
was tomato water yeah yeah there's some

1893
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:24,880
really random [ __ ] out there that does

1894
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:27,560
not have like a desirability

1895
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,039
yeah to to me well sometimes the things

1896
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,000
that you think would work don't like

1897
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,600
I've never seen just straight lemon tree

1898
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,359
and Skittles Mak sense to even though

1899
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,880
like on paper that sounds like it would

1900
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:39,759
rock lemon is just so recessive and

1901
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,920
dominant it's like anything you cross

1902
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,800
like lemon with is just going to come

1903
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,920
out with lemon dominance over it and

1904
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,520
that's why that's what I'm kind of

1905
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,840
talking about is like allowing for

1906
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,560
whatever you're breeding to cross into

1907
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:55,800
something that will where you can still

1908
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,840
get a representation of both a dominant

1909
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,480
ter yeah and hopefully you're getting it

1910
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,639
like a sliding scale this way like 10%

1911
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:05,158
of the father and 90% of the mother or

1912
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:07,880
the other side of the scale you know 90%

1913
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:11,119
of the the father and 10% of the mother

1914
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:12,639
right like in good yeah then you know

1915
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:15,198
there's the 50/50 in the middle like

1916
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:17,679
this is exact like the Oz K is like in

1917
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:20,279
my opinion is is literally half OG half

1918
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:22,840
and half oh you're say the dominance is

1919
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:25,000
not a good thing the breed the half and

1920
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:27,440
half is better no I think you want both

1921
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,119
yeah I think you want all I think there

1922
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:32,399
happens you could get one where it's a

1923
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:35,639
perfect blend of yeah like you know uh

1924
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:39,238
like the ozk and

1925
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:40,960
um Clementine like that's what made

1926
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:43,479
really nice that that's what made our

1927
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,480
lemon citrine right and the lemon ozk

1928
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:49,839
feno there was two different really

1929
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:52,158
great fenos in there both where like it

1930
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:55,360
just had this perfect really enjoyable

1931
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:57,559
lemon tone to it but also this mandarin

1932
01:19:55,359 --> 01:20:01,079
orange aspect to it that came from the

1933
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:04,800
Clementine right and uh which is also

1934
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:07,439
hard to get rid of yeah yeah like but

1935
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,960
there are fenos of orange and lemon that

1936
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:11,039
are more enjoyable than other fenos yeah

1937
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,279
there's ones that are like really

1938
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:15,760
astringent and offensive that aren't as

1939
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:17,319
that Sting the nose or become just too

1940
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,000
offensive in a dab they're hard on your

1941
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:20,599
throat and they're hard to breathe they

1942
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,760
make people kind of sensitive and then

1943
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:24,760
there's ones that you're like wow that

1944
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,880
is a really smooth lemon you know like

1945
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:29,840
and I think that's where like the lemon

1946
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:34,359
ozk and the

1947
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:37,239
uh the uh the lemon Catrine were were

1948
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:39,759
really great selections of of of unique

1949
01:20:37,238 --> 01:20:41,799
lemon turps that had lemon and Mandarin

1950
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,960
variations more orange on this side or

1951
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,840
more lemon on this side yeah and not as

1952
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:49,520
much as just in the middle you know hey

1953
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:51,920
I wanted to ask you um you said you were

1954
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:54,239
experimenting with some out out of state

1955
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:58,079
Ventures yeah yeah how is that working

1956
01:20:54,238 --> 01:21:01,000
and is that does that equal new Brad

1957
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:03,519
stores out of state or no no it's not

1958
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,639
retail it's just flower production um

1959
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,880
our first expansion was Michigan but

1960
01:21:05,639 --> 01:21:09,239
that just came to an end unfortunately

1961
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:11,159
and so you guys are actually expanding

1962
01:21:09,238 --> 01:21:14,839
infrastructure not just

1963
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:18,198
IPA uh no we work with cultivations that

1964
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:21,440
like typically what ends up happening is

1965
01:21:18,198 --> 01:21:23,559
uh cultivations in other states they

1966
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:25,439
they get set up early they had the money

1967
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:27,280
in the financing so a lot of the out

1968
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:30,678
ofate situations end up being where it's

1969
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:33,479
a really good time for the first people

1970
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:35,319
that get on the scene quickly they can

1971
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:37,279
produce whatever type of product and

1972
01:21:35,319 --> 01:21:40,479
it'll do well cuz it's a

1973
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:41,920
very uh like limited quantity right

1974
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:44,238
there's a ton of excitement when a New

1975
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:46,800
Market opens yeah and then competition

1976
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:49,359
comes in and you need kind of a higher

1977
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,639
level of expertise to stand out and and

1978
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:53,920
to make sense of when prices start to

1979
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:56,480
come down you need to be able to produce

1980
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,560
higher yields with higher quality to be

1981
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:02,119
uh competitive so that's typically when

1982
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:04,080
grow will reach out to us and and or

1983
01:22:02,119 --> 01:22:05,559
Partnerships will start to happen when

1984
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,960
the markets are getting tougher we've

1985
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:11,800
never been really lucky enough to get

1986
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:14,639
licenses out of state or have enough uh

1987
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:17,639
you know money to to go build $10

1988
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:20,239
million in you know an emerging market

1989
01:22:17,639 --> 01:22:23,600
right like with the deals that you have

1990
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:25,839
are you also um I guess are like

1991
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:29,760
prescribed s so is or are they running

1992
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:33,079
your genetics their way no they they

1993
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,719
know that they want our help yeah and it

1994
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:37,559
it's been very good in that sense like

1995
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:40,079
when it was Michigan and in Arizona the

1996
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:43,480
the teams that were there that were uh

1997
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:45,960
put together we went there and showed

1998
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:48,879
them our Sops how we do things that

1999
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,679
makes you know weekly phone calls uh you

2000
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:53,319
know if there's a question about this

2001
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:55,279
just call us we're you know we're not

2002
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:56,960
you know we we've been doing it for a

2003
01:22:55,279 --> 01:22:59,238
long time so we know how things should

2004
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,480
work right and you when you go somewhere

2005
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:03,399
that doesn't really have the same level

2006
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:05,198
experience they're still figuring it out

2007
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:08,238
and it's it's normally not like they're

2008
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:10,079
super far off it's just like a few

2009
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:12,158
tweaks here in this phase and a few

2010
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:14,279
tweaks here in this phas you know they

2011
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:16,519
everybody's got lights and air

2012
01:23:14,279 --> 01:23:19,158
conditioners and Deus and plants that

2013
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:21,239
are growing and you know got fertigation

2014
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:23,960
going but it's just about how you use

2015
01:23:21,238 --> 01:23:26,158
every one of those things you know how

2016
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:28,880
how you're running your environmental

2017
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:30,799
how you're using your lighting and how

2018
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,960
you're keeping your plant Health you

2019
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,600
know the products that you're using are

2020
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:38,719
they not necessary or are they necessary

2021
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,800
and some people have just over

2022
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:44,239
complicated it what kind of lighting do

2023
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:46,440
you like I like a combination of the uh

2024
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:49,479
the double-ended and the LED together

2025
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:51,678
uhuh in in a a room a checker board the

2026
01:23:49,479 --> 01:23:53,559
checker board Westing okay cool and do

2027
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,000
you notice there being like weaker spots

2028
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:57,880
in the room because

2029
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,439
no it it ends up kind of being a nice

2030
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:02,520
throw because on a

2031
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:04,519
checkerboard you know you're getting o

2032
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:07,800
like this this yeah you're getting

2033
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:10,600
everything like uh overlapping MH in

2034
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:13,159
different places and you get a pretty

2035
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:15,800
even uh Lighting in that sense do you

2036
01:24:13,158 --> 01:24:17,759
have more lights then per square foot

2037
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,119
checkerboarding or is it about the same

2038
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:23,600
it's about the same like every 5 ft mhm

2039
01:24:20,119 --> 01:24:25,439
you know um and to me that that always

2040
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:29,679
gave us like

2041
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:33,039
The Best of Both Worlds um I think LED

2042
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:36,440
veg lights are are superior

2043
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:38,960
to um bulbs so we use LED lighting and

2044
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:42,279
veg and MH and when you can when you're

2045
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:44,520
transitioning from led to the your Bloom

2046
01:24:42,279 --> 01:24:47,158
room you want LED in your Bloom room so

2047
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,080
you don't have this transitional shock

2048
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:51,198
where that's where a lot of people like

2049
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:53,279
their plants go from being like healthy

2050
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:54,519
and veg and they go to their Bloom room

2051
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:56,479
and the environment's different the

2052
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:59,800
lighting's different and everything kind

2053
01:24:56,479 --> 01:25:01,759
of just responds in a a negative way

2054
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:04,360
until it acclimates to that new

2055
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:06,159
environment then it starts to grow again

2056
01:25:04,359 --> 01:25:08,960
properly but so you're saying keep the

2057
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:10,679
environments the same in each stage of

2058
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,920
growth yeah when you're transitioning

2059
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:17,319
from one room to the next you should try

2060
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:21,199
to keep it similar from the transition

2061
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:24,279
yeah don't go from 300 ppfd in veg to

2062
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:29,599
1,000 ppfd In Bloom and not expect to

2063
01:25:24,279 --> 01:25:33,158
plants to be shocked you know like um

2064
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:35,119
humidity uh light you know the the air

2065
01:25:33,158 --> 01:25:38,399
conditioning the temperatures they

2066
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:40,880
should be relatively similar going from

2067
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:43,559
your your veg space to your Bloom space

2068
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:45,400
yeah sounds logical yeah at a certain

2069
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:49,560
scale is there

2070
01:25:45,399 --> 01:25:52,279
like math on having a veg in a bloom

2071
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:54,520
room versus just having stuff go through

2072
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:57,719
the whole process in a single room yeah

2073
01:25:54,520 --> 01:26:02,800
no doubt I I think

2074
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:04,840
um it's if you doing like Drop flip TR

2075
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,880
with if you're able to transition with

2076
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:10,000
moving your plants into bloom right and

2077
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,639
get six Harvest or maybe even seven

2078
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Harvest a year out of that one room

2079
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:16,840
depending on a genetic some genetics

2080
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,359
like Skittles are like 49 days to me you

2081
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:22,079
know like that allows you to get you

2082
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:25,439
know to get your seven is woof but yeah

2083
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:28,399
you can do it but um certain strains

2084
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:32,678
though that you got to take 56 63 days

2085
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:35,198
65 days you know maybe 67 like that's

2086
01:26:32,679 --> 01:26:38,639
about the extent of the length that will

2087
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:40,279
let it go because just economically it

2088
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,920
it messes with your schedule around the

2089
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:44,599
whole building and keeping the flow

2090
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,639
proper one also just like square footage

2091
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,079
utilization you know you can have plants

2092
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:50,400
more compact in vegge and then you move

2093
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,600
them into your flower room where the

2094
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:54,599
things are your trays are a little more

2095
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,000
spaced out and yeah totally um but I

2096
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,079
think that's when they need more space

2097
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,840
this has been an amazing conversation

2098
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:01,479
yeah thanks for coming down BR yeah

2099
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,880
really could probably talk for a long

2100
01:27:01,479 --> 01:27:04,638
time but it would make sense to wrap it

2101
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,199
up but yeah thank you so much for being
