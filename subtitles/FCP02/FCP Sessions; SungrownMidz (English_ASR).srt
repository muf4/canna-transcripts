and uh so for those who aren't aware of

47
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,099
what free seed days it's basically an

48
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,559
event thrown by Edgar AKA Masonic smoker

49
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:18,479
at his store on Fairfax

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,098
um it was from 10 to 3 yesterday but the

51
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,679
line started on Wednesday and the event

52
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:26,818
was on a Saturday and basically you can

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,400
pull up in a bunch of uh

54
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:30,719
people will chip in their seeds and what

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,039
they want to give out in terms of gear

56
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,780
and you can come and collect the bag and

57
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,519
Trevor is one of those people who had a

58
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,840
table there and was giving out gear as

59
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,060
well and did you see anything super

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,979
interesting there in terms of gear stuff

61
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,780
because I saw stuff coming in from Ukiah

62
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,299
stuff coming in from other states and

63
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,640
some CBDs some Autos so just wanted to

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,340
see if anything caught your interest uh

65
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,919
uh yeah there it was

66
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,140
this time it was interesting to see uh

67
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,259
some of the people who showed up

68
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:01,919
um like there was some old school cats

69
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:04,079
who are like you know La Legends to a

70
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,119
certain extent at this point DNA was

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,940
there Crockett was there and it was cool

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,860
to see those guys at seed day because

73
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,259
I've been to every free seed day since

74
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,580
the first one when Masonic first did it

75
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,979
and um

76
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,500
you know this time it was

77
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,238
it's been super efficient in the past

78
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,519
where it was like you know the bags were

79
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,739
pre-made people stood in line they came

80
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,780
in they got their bags they were able to

81
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,840
get some shirts and different stuff but

82
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,598
like it was quick fast this time people

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,640
got to come in there was tables out they

84
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,619
got to select different stuff that they

85
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,899
wanted to select they got to add and

86
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,379
kind of build your own bag and like that

87
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,200
was super cool and um yeah it was it was

88
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:48,658
legit in terms of seeing how many people

89
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,560
were there you know there was Bloom

90
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:54,239
there was big names people Oni was there

91
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,039
what he was handing out absolutely

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,759
incredible if you got one of those Oni

93
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:02,519
packs like that's special and yeah just

94
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,739
I bumped into people who had gotten my

95
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,120
stuff at previous free seed days and

96
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,280
talked about the different gear that

97
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,140
they had and like you know I made all

98
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,680
these Pina hash plant crosses with my

99
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,658
buddy uh landhammer farms and those

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,780
crosses have made some great

101
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:23,279
concentrates and some great flowers and

102
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:25,379
people have those Pina hash plants seeds

103
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,939
and they can go and make their own and

104
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:30,000
breed with that and make their own

105
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,918
little thing and I think that you know

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,500
that's something that's really awesome

107
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,899
about free seed day is that people are

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,000
getting like they're not just getting

109
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,679
random ass packs like you're actually

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,240
getting breeding gear you're getting

111
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,879
stuff that you could start a company

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,860
with if you wanted to well and so we got

113
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,399
something different last year not the

114
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,840
Pina gear put some Sky cuddler from you

115
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,359
um I think it just happened to be in the

116
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,399
pre-made bag that we got and it was one

117
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,319
of our favorite things that we

118
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,939
ran and so that was I guess what you

119
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,680
were giving out last year this year was

120
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,719
the The Pina

121
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,879
um I know sorry yeah the TKA Dem 10

122
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,400
sorry what's what are you working on

123
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,879
like in the near future and sort of or

124
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,679
in looking towards next year I think

125
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,279
next year people are either going to get

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,978
gold star crosses from um I got some

127
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:24,899
seeds Kevin Jody hooked me up with some

128
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:27,300
gold star F5s and uh I got really I'll

129
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,579
be honest somewhat depressing

130
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,400
germination rates on them I got like

131
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,439
eight out of 72 seeds but out of those

132
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,978
eight I'm gonna keep them all keep all

133
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,379
the males and uh we'll do as much of an

134
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:43,199
increase as we can with those and then

135
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:46,800
otherwise I'm uh also selecting males

136
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:51,379
from an afro Pips Malawi gold and so

137
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,379
expect Malawi crosses next year

138
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,959
last time we linked up a couple months

139
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:56,639
ago

140
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,758
um I had some of your Malawi chem and

141
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,439
some of the Malawi Wilson and those two

142
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,000
were some of my favorite smokes of the

143
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,939
last few months

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,978
um I mean they're just phenomenal any

145
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:11,639
time of the day smoke absolutely fire

146
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:14,399
thanks man that yeah I um one of those

147
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,439
Malawi crosses I'm growing out some more

148
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,239
I've got a bunch of the Malawi chem

149
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,759
started I'm actually kicking myself

150
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,860
because I had a bunch

151
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,199
it's old seed stock it wasn't

152
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,479
particularly good looking seed stock

153
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,280
there was like a lot of white seeds and

154
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,978
so when I just popped my seeds this year

155
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,619
I put a bunch of like three four you

156
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:37,500
know seeds in a Cell every one of them

157
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,079
popped and so I'm like you know yeah

158
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,959
yeah like and there's just there's

159
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:46,500
two to three times more than I expected

160
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,719
to grow and so I I've got a bunch of

161
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,839
seedlings that I'm gonna try to bring

162
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,240
down yeah that is awesome man so yes we

163
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,859
may do a little thing in the coming you

164
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,139
know next month or something I'll come

165
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,360
down have little starts and some watches

166
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,360

00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,879
increase and those there's there's a

218
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,120
whole bunch of them there was like

219
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:21,179
there's the sky cuddler f4s that got

220
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,419
made there was also the um

221
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:26,579
uh some no magic that you guys got oh

222
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:30,059
yeah we're excited about those

223
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,100
some some no magic I believe you said

224
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:34,199
that was Masonic yeah that's from our

225
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,420
good friend Masonic we

226
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,379
are so [ __ ] excited to grow that [ __ ]

227
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:41,819
we um you know

228
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,740
we love everything we've ever grown from

229
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,560
Masonic in our last Garden we had is

230
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,720
Chiclets and his banana God Z3 both of

231
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,639
those [ __ ] fire

232
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,339
absolutely fire

233
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,259
banana God Z3 was the one yeah that

234
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,180
banana God Z3 is really good we got a

235
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,700
bunch of uh a bunch of clones going from

236
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:02,278
that one I think that's the out of out

237
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,580
of the out of the garden our favorites

238
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:08,338
were probably banana God Z3 Chiclets and

239
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,320
Sky color Kush which were all things I

240
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,839
think we got it free seed Day last year

241
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,000
yeah it all comes full circle last year

242
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,980
you said something that really struck me

243
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,919
and I wonder if you'd elaborate on it

244
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,019
you just sort of spoke about how you

245
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,219
viewed partially what Masonic was

246
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,019
building but also sort of what was

247
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,600
happening in like Urban centers and how

248
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:31,620
they've become equally sort of centers

249
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,180
of influence around stuff genetic stuff

250
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,679
um as much as what's going on on the

251
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,958
hill and so I was curious

252
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,179
yeah if you have thoughts on that I

253
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,719
definitely think that what mace is built

254
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:45,719
there at his shop is a a cultural Hub

255
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,820
where people can come you know every

256
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,519
weekend he's open if you've got an

257
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,019
opportunity and you're in the LA area

258
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,879
just to experience it you should come

259
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,159
down even if you're not a grower or a

260
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,379
breeder it's definitely worth coming and

261
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:02,699
experiencing what he's building there

262
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:05,220
and the thing is is that

263
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,399
you know there's been epicenters for

264
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,220
years in terms of like

265
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,799
up north up in the hills in Mendo and

266
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,899
humble like as when I was a kid a lot of

267
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,659
us started out we'd go up there and we'd

268
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,578
trim and so we'd trim we'd get seeds

269
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:22,139
we'd bring them back to wherever we were

270
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:24,419
and then we'd start growing out those

271
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,458
seeds and that kind of like got us on

272
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:29,879
our foundation and leveled us up in a

273
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:32,278
certain way and that's not accessible

274
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,379
it's particularly not accessible anymore

275
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,360
because the whole trim scenes like gone

276
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,159
and dead like that's not really probably

277
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,620
one of the last contemporary kids to

278
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,480
like get in on a big grow and become the

279
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,759
grower there from trimming in the last

280
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,100
like four years like that's not a thing

281
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,419
anymore yeah yeah like that is it's

282
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,519
strange that it happened to me that's

283
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,278
like when I ran my first big spot like

284
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,200
that was by proxy of literally just

285
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,419
getting a trim job there you work your

286
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,680
way up they eventually need they

287
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:00,179
eventually need somebody to cover and

288
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,859
then boom you're [ __ ] running a 50

289
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,659
lighter all of a sudden now you've only

290
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,000
grown in your backyard and in a garage

291
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:07,860
before like yeah and honestly it doesn't

292
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,299
happen anymore as much trimming's a

293
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,039
great way to learn learn about the plant

294
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,259
because you really get to learn the

295
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,879
structure and details of individual

296
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,559
plants and the variations and

297
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,720
differences and the better you get at

298
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,479
trimming the more you get to like

299
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,320
understand the plant on a morphological

300
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:28,620
sort of basis and so that Lake those

301
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,720
first early years that was that was our

302
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,060
a lot of people's introduction and

303
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,120
access to good genetics the clubs came

304
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:38,759
along eventually the Bay Area clubs were

305
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,159
you know an epicenter La absolutely

306
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,319
popped off but again

307
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,659
that whole dynamic and everything about

308
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,459
that has changed there's not really so

309
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,860
much of a community there's not so much

310
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,479
of a trading underground thing unless

311
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,159
you're on the internet

312
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,620
and the internet's cool but it's

313
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,899
amorphous and what mace has done is he's

314
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,419
given a brick and mortar location for

315
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,700
this type of thing to get together and

316
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:06,719
giving people in urban centers like La

317
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,519
who had no access and no no way going up

318
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,100
into the [ __ ] Hills of Mendo and

319
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,278
Humboldt or wherever they now can just

320
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,379
go down to Fairfax of all places and get

321
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:19,980
in on that and experience it in a way

322
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,720
that you know gives them access to this

323
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,000
community to these genetics these

324
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,800
resources but also

325
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,320
you know I've met so many people there

326
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,179
from who have just become regulars at

327
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,760
the shop and learned so much and leveled

328
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:35,399
their games up like I got flower at uh

329
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,620
this year and I've seen these people's

330
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,480
flower for the last three years and it's

331
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,019
gotten consistently better and better

332
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,740
and better and so that's something that

333
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:49,320
you know we've got a new

334
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,019
a new sort of cultural Hub and a new way

335
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,879
for the culture to expand and articulate

336
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,620
and express itself that I think is

337
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,838
beautiful

338
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,700
I really think that is the the best way

339
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,519
to describe what my songs on Fairfax

340
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,259
really isn't all about even from a

341
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,879
Southern California perspective there

342
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,799
really was no place before that you

343
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,179
could connect at least the city of 10

344
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,379
million people and most people tend to

345
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:13,620
stay in their little neighborhood or

346
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:15,179
city and so I kind of gave people down

347
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,220
here as well a place to connect with

348
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,259
others and and build camaraderie and

349
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,480
just grow on that aspect like can't they

350
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,159
do on the hill where people are more so

351
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,420
a tight-knit community and I feel like

352
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,519
La is venturing towards that and

353
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:29,939
masonics is definitely the focal point

354
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,820
of where all that is originating from

355
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,260
exactly anyone who shows interests and

356
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,700
you never know who you're gonna see

357
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,078
there and on top of that it doesn't

358
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,180
matter if you're affiliated with

359
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,399
cannabis or not he's happy to answer any

360
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:44,039
questions about what it is I've seen

361
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,958
people walk in with no idea what's going

362
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,698
on and he'll just sit them down and

363
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,578
educate them and

364
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:51,719
to people's coming in what's a masonic

365
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:53,759
smoker

366
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,100
that [ __ ] is so funny or some people

367
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,139
will walk out like after having taken a

368
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,060
giant dab maybe never having taken a dab

369
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,620
in their life but just our cannabis

370
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,719
enthusiasts that happened to stumble in

371
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,240
because they think it's a shirt store or

372
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,399
something or just are curious yeah you

373
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,980
know the vibe is cool and the locals

374
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,899
there like mace gets a lot of love and

375
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,778
the people who are kind of like have

376
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:18,240
it's Masonic no context you know they

377
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:20,039
just walk in they've got no idea and

378
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,159
they see these shirts they see a bunch

379
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,379
of people around the table and it's a

380
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,539
it's a retail experience they've never

381
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,720
seen right and they're like what what's

382
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:32,759
this about and you know there's a

383
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,639
possibility for a lot of culture clash

384
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,919
and uh like potentially like bad

385
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,278
outcomes I've never seen it yeah I've

386
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,259
never seen it mace handles it and like

387
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:46,139
interacts with people who don't have any

388
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,360
idea about what's going on in a way that

389
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,698
just like brings them into the set in

390
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,500
the community and like you know people

391
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:55,019
right there in that shop shopping center

392
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,419
like went from being like what the [ __ ]

393
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,799
is this to like what's up what would

394
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,599
show with this yeah and I think that all

395
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,639
stems from how open mace isn't

396
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,079
approachable as well like we said anyone

397
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,698
can walk into the shop and you'll still

398
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,379
be the first person to greet them ask

399
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,179
them how their day is ask them what's up

400
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:10,620
and tell them all about the store and

401
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,599
what he's about and I really think

402
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,860
that's something that stands for stands

403
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,560
for more than that so that's something

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:30,000
yeah no they're they're unique it's nice

597
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:32,940
when that stuff kind of comes through in

598
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,159
the uh in the concentrate and you really

599
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,080
really get like

600
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,299
true to form where you're like yeah this

601
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,980
is pineapple and that's the type that

602
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:43,379
you don't really see but I've seen it's

603
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,058
making a Resurgence at least uh I was at

604
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,340
a funeral hunt last week where uh

605
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:49,859
pineapple and terpinoline and Jack

606
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:51,658
flavors were the the highlighting

607
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:53,399
yeah I gotta rung out after about eight

608
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,200
or nine of those duties but it's just

609
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,820
something that you're right it when you

610
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,080
can forward the taste all the way

611
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:01,079
through it is something that's very

612
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:05,099
present and very uh

613
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:07,740
straightforward those uh those Terps on

614
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:10,139
that Lifesaver are really unique you

615
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,659
know I mean like head entrancing almost

616
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,278
yeah and it's just it's like we were

617
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,679
saying like you just don't get that in

618
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,778
most concentrate because you know the

619
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,059
yields aren't there necessarily but like

620
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,400
uh it's not production it's not

621
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:26,940
production hash it's a flavor hunting

622
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,220
hash yeah also it's head stash yeah no

623
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,798
and it's it's worth it on that level

624
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:36,019
like if you get to experience it it's

625
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,019
it's unlike whatever you're gonna try

626
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,159
it was

627
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:46,139
it was 14 grams total six pounds 14

628
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,340
grams total from six pounds of fresh

629
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,919
Frozen

630
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:54,980
yeah yeah no and so

631
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:58,259
you know at those fashion projects

632
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:00,419
it's legit to see that Simon

633
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:01,980
um and to be able to experience it

634
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,960
because it's like it's a one and done

635
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,319
and that's something that's really

636
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,319
unique

637
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,940
