103
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,759
i bought the property from the biggest

104
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,318
meth

105
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,798
cooker in freaking mendocino county oh

106
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,639
no his name was john loudermilk and they

107
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,879
called it the louder powder

108
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,798
and they had been after this guy for

109
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,598
[ __ ] decades this guy was like the

110
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,959
king and he like had people hired in the

111
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,079
sheriff's department they would tell him

112
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,598
when they're gonna rate him and he'd

113
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840
like clean it up you're like [ __ ] you

114
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,840
you know

115
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,679
eventually and then it's gonna get dark

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,799
for a second just

117
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,799
you can cut this if you want it

118
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,759
so john laudermonk just was was i

119
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,878
i wish i knew it before about the

120
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,759
property i probably wouldn't bought it

121
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,878
yeah

122
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,719
um but

123
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,719
they were after him so hard and they

124
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,318
just could never get him

125
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,719
and uh

126
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,679
and so they they framed him

127
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,439
they they got this glassware from humble

128
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,239
evidence room and brought it up and they

129
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,040
framed him and busted him

130
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,679
and

131
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,840
at some point at the same property

132
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,519
during that same time

133
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,560
uh he had a party and this girl

134
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,439
like

135
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,000
that

136
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,439
fell down the stairs and died and they

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,918
were having a bear all raging and

138
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:41,759
partying and stuff and he ended up

139
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,758
burying this girl on the property no no

140
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,720
and then later on

141
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,120
went and

142
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,199
told them like hey this was an accident

143
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,160
and told him where she was whatever but

144
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,759
now

145
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,080
so they got him like tampering with dead

146
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,879
body or whatever like

147
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,599
and

148
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,918
and uh but they also framed him and then

149
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,520
he caught them framing him

150
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,478
and so now he's in court on both these

151
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,680
things

152
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:08,319
and and they they they're like

153
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,720
ended up going from from over 300 back

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,439
that was 94. that's a lot of plans for

169
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,120
94. it was a lot of fun

170
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,759
and the only reason that we kind of got

171
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,519
a good deal is they were on a probation

172
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,960
search when they actually came to the

173
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,478
property they were looking for him they

174
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,719
didn't realize the property sold so they

175
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,719
cut all the locks without a warrant and

176
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,240
so they kind of had if we went all the

177
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,160
way to trial

178
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
it would have been like we might have

179
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,919
won yeah

180
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,478
and so they offered a good deal but they

181
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,959
also got to put my wife in prison if

182
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,599
like we didn't take it so i i took the

183
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,279
deal and i did like seven months in

184
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
in uh in

185
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,119
mendocino county jail which was on low

186
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,199
gap so i kind of i went from oak gap to

187
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,000
low gap oh man

188
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,680
that's a quick slide it's it's crazy to

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,399
me how many stories we hear in the

190
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,079
cannabis industry about

191
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,159
people who are you know just growing

192
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,639
cannabis getting rung up for the

193
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,560
previous tenants of properties

194
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,639
who are doing much much darker things

195
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
who managed to skate through it with

196
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
little or no consequence and yet then

197
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,319
the cannabis growers were the people who

198
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,600
got wrung up i i had a similar

199
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,240
experience

200
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,840
in humboldt after uh you know

201
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
somebody was doing the wrong thing on

202
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,679
the property and you know the cops come

203
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,239
two years late

204
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,160
and catch somebody growing weed it's

205
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,038
it's crazy

206
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,639
but so this is 94 and personally i'm a

207
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,719
little younger so i was really just

208
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,598
starting to get heavily into cannabis at

209
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,000
this time and in the midwest and 3 300

210
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,439
plants to me looking back it's like wow

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,879
we had like seven

212
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,560
and we thought we were a big deal in

213
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,120
michigan you know growing it in the corn

214

232
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,639
goes was it considered it was the big

233
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,360
one it was a big one but i was young

234
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,360

236
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,879
you know

237
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,360
so they kind of

238
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,800
it was one they were like they kind of

239
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,199
were culpable in the mid the probation

240
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,319
