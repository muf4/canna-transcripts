1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,799
and I think this would be a cool broad

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:07,798
point of view from all three of you guys

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,638
canopy management I see the cuting

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,719
behind Corey which you know are

5
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:13,558
obviously taken pretty well they're all

6
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,399
they're all about the same height you

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:19,239
can see the large canopy behind Anthony

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,358
and I imagine if that's a grow behind

9
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:24,000
Damon I imagine he's paid some attention

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,840
to canopy management as well but I feel

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,518
like there's no real no I feel like

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,200
there's no standard or like I feel like

13
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,280
it's like where art becomes more than it

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,280
becomes more of an art than a science

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,840
from grow room to grow room facility to

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,679
facility you know like and I feel like

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,239
it's a very underd discussed topic but I

18
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:48,238
feel like it's such an important one to

19
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,519
maybe maximize yield or maximize the

20
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,479
happiness of the plant maximize air flow

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,840
just try to maximize all the things and

22
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:59,358
I feel like in the ABC book of

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,000
growing there's just not many references

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,079
I want to get that narrative going and

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,078
see like people's point of

26
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,319
view Cory you want to go first I can go

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,320
first if not yeah go ahead brother I'll

28
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:16,438
take a little bit of a break

29
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,359
here yeah I

30
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:23,078
think it's something that's

31
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,879
uh I would say there's like not a a

32
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,798
one-size fits-all for anyone right so

33
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,959
the only way that it can be like sort of

34
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:34,000
standardized in the future is

35
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,478
by in my opinion like teaching Growers

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,118
how to discern like if you

37
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:44,000
can do a certain style of training in

38
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:45,560
your facility or not like for example if

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,959
you don't

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,840
have um the systems to handle like a

41
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,798
massive amount of flower weight in your

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,478
room it might be unwise to go like with

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,399
a super thick sea of green like you see

44
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,679
behind me or

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,478
whereas uh you

46
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,879
know there's plenty of benefits to just

47
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,598
going uh with a clone that you you don't

48
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:13,799
mess with at all uh you don't prune it

49
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,079
and it's just

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,480
apical um it's definitely a little bit

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,440
easier in those cases when you're not

52
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,039
doing as much plant training to just

53
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,598
maintain the environment a little bit

54
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:29,000
more so I feel like just Growers just

55
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:34,719
need to learn how to discern like okay

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,759
can can I do this uh even and if so like

57
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:41,000
push your you know push your crop to the

58
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,199
limits of your growth space but I think

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,878
that it's it's hard to standardize like

60
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:50,199
there's a right now a wave out west for

61
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:52,799
sure of a lot of guys uh touting a lot

62
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:55,039
of the benefits of not topping and I

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,000
think that there's really there's

64
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:01,759
benefits to both people are like I've

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,799
done a million studies side by side and

66
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,239
I just you know people are convinced of

67
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,040
one way or the other but I think it's

68
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,480
not necessarily a matter of which way is

69
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,158
better it's always going to be your grow

70
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,919
space is limited so there's going to be

71
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,359
a best way for your space but it's just

72
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,359
about Discerning that I think and

73
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,879
figuring that out for me and for this

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,680
space we had great HVAC and just our

75
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,798
systems could handle a super thick

76
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,200
canopy which is why we pushed it uh we

77
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,200
didn't do like a whole lot of like

78
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,238
topping and stuff but essentially it's

79
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:40,359
like a one top and veg let them run

80
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,878
through the end of uh stretch and during

81
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,519
those first three weeks of stretch we

82
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:47,479
are you know doing some LST under the

83
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,039
the trellis and bending and whatnot but

84
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:54,238
it's very minimal on like plant pruning

85
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,560
but I definitely think that to speak to

86
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,799
your yield Point uh this is something

87
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,759
that is huge for maximizing your crop

88
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,438
but it's it's you don't want to like

89
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,919
always go with this approach because it

90
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,158
can certainly be too much if your

91
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,839
systems can't handle it but that's my

92
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:09,840
long-winded

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,360
answer I'm glad someone else has a

94
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,238
long-winded answer on this thing other

95
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,799
than me um yeah so I mean there's like

96
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,239
yeah there's a lot of parameters for

97
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,679
this one you can feel free to cut me off

98
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,639
whenever you want because I'm gonna for

99
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,600
sure um so it depends number one like

100
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,478
yeah your space or or also the way I

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,720
also kind of take a look at that is like

102
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,918
what are your goals particularly you

103
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,960
know are you in a commercial grow you

104
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,399
know are you hanging out and just doing

105
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,120
stuff in a couple of tents there's a

106
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,758
totally different strategies you know

107
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,720
before I was just I wasn't topping

108
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,879
pretty much anything in my tents I was

109
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,520
just you know filling pots side by side

110
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,159
and just trying to get as much kind of

111
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,159
plant material there was the same thing

112
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,039
when I was you know testing out Auto

113
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,759
flowers you know you just kind of put

114
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:02,639
them in drop them and just kind of see

115
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,720
you know what different types of

116
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,918
cannabis plants do for you

117
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,360
so um that's a huge thing you know if

118
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:13,079
you're in the commercial space a few

119
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,038
parameters for you in your commercial

120
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,478
space is definitely your canopy so um

121
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,279
you want to make sure that all of your

122
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,519
trellis squares are have something in

123
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,918
them you know you don't want any empty

124
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:27,639
space in there you want that maximized

125
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:29,758
for sure empty spaces is a wasted

126
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,680
opportunity financially for the business

127
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,160
so you want to make sure that those are

128
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,600
full you then also have like other

129
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,600
parameters in your space and this also

130
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,360
will apply at home but it's like what

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,879
system do you have at home are you

132
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,160
growing in rockwool are you doing a

133
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:49,159
living soil system because the response

134
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,880
rate of your plants and your ability to

135
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,759
feed them is going to be totally

136
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,639
different so you can be pretty

137
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,000
aggressive in the hydroponic setting

138
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,478
whereas if you're going over in living

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,918
soil probably want to chill out a little

140
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,478
bit understand your liquid feed system

141
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,038
if that's what also you're doing in a

142
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:09,959
robust living soil system and try and

143
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,159
and manage that when you're pinching

144
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,560
your plant you have to you know also

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,759
think about that you know um are you

146
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,478
going to need an increased calcium so

147
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,840
that you're you know helping your shoot

148
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,199
tips actually grow while you're you know

149
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,318
doing that or you just pinching your

150
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,000
plant lacking in calcium and then not

151
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,598
getting the response that you want so

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,800
it's also having that nutritional

153
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:33,319
understanding of what you're doing with

154
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,879
it and then like if you're in the

155
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:39,160
greenhouse um you have different seasons

156
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,560
so you have a different light level that

157
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,439
is going to affect the growth rate of

158
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,759
your plants so if you're indoors you're

159
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,439
maximizing ppfd all the time you can

160
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,680
just [ __ ] slam it when you're in the

161
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,478
greenhouse you know even if you do have

162
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,199
supplemental lighting it's still not

163
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:57,159
going to be the same so for us when I

164
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,319
was working in the greenhouse we had

165
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,520
distinct times when we would reduce the

166
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,720
amount ount of shoots on their plants

167
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,680
and you know increase the amount of

168
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,639
shoots on their plant in the winter time

169
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,319
uh we would try and have more shoots

170
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,160
that are out there because we weren't

171
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,840
getting as much development if we had

172
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,599
less and then in the summertime I mean

173
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,119
the plants were just [ __ ] rocking and

174
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,839
rolling so we would reduce the number of

175
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,160
shoots because the plant was you know

176
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,878
just developing all this biomass where

177
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,560
we didn't need to have as many shoots

178
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,759
that were in there those plants C were

179
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,478
doing really well so you know for me

180
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,120
currently right now what I'm trying to

181
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:36,959
understand is you know how many shoots

182
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,199
am I going for because I do have some

183
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:45,399
math in my head so a quick calculation

184
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:47,720
is I pinch to uh six uh stems so I'll or

185
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,758
yeah I'll go and count six pinch that on

186
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,520
the top and then in a week to 10 days

187
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,759
after that I'm going to pinch those six

188
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,158
and then I'm going to have

189
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,800
12 and then a week after that I'm going

190
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,560
to go and pinch those 12 and I'll have

191
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,639
24 at the end of flower

192
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,918
so that way then I can calculate stem

193
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,439
density on my plant and then try and

194
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,758
deliver the right amount of nutrition

195
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:10,719
equally to all of those plants that's

196
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,080
the one of the worst things that you can

197
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,800
do for canopy management is make that

198
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,038
uneven so if you have a different amount

199
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,759
of stems per different plant that is

200
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:21,759
going to have a different nutrition

201
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,479
requirement so you want to make sure

202
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,960
that if you have those targets you have

203
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:28,399
those goals that it's one consistent

204
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,239
Target that you're doing or if you are

205
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,478
going to do you know two different

206
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,440
strategies in a room put that one

207
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,800
strategy in a place where you're a g to

208
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,000
remember it don't want to lose track of

209
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,120
it but make sure that they're all

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,399
together because that canopy size is

211
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,679
going to be different than the other one

212
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,600
for example I'm doing a six shoot

213
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,039
strategy and a fores shoot strategy

214
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,639
right now because I don't know what the

215
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,278
[ __ ] is this new cultivar that I'm

216
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,199
growing I'm going to try both so I put

217
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,399
my ones that I pinched you know they

218
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,600
reached a 6inch stage I'm pinching that

219
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,958
at four I'm going to let those fly in

220
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,000
obey and then everything else I pinched

221
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,439
to six and we'll kind of figure it out

222
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,879
from there but all those are grouped

223
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,680
together so that I can make sure that

224
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,799
that canopy is you know managed I know

225
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,359
one of the other ways people do a canopy

226
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:18,159
management is you know taking a

227
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,800
measurement so uh Mac 1 for example that

228
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,559
cut that I was growing uh we would go by

229
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,000
Heights we didn't really give a [ __ ]

230
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,799
about stems we would go by Heights

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,919
strict Heights 11 in 22 in and then

232
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:35,120
another one 34 and it was just that is

233
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,559
what we did um so there's definitely

234
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,759
more than one way to fry a fish um and

235
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,399
so just understand what you're doing I

236
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,519
would you know again at the commercial

237
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,360
space one last kind of piece of advice

238
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,159
is I would be really careful about you

239
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,720
know stretching out your stems and doing

240
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,719
any LST training things in there because

241
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,879
at the end of it you got to harvest

242
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,600
those [ __ ] things and if you're like

243
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,039
pulling your plant out and it's a little

244
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,839
bit crooked and it's getting caught in

245
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,480
the

246
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,079
because your worker isn't really doing

247
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,680
you know paying attention to the plant

248
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,879
that could potentially cause you a

249
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,759
little bit of trouble so make sure that

250
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,000
you kind of you know be a little bit

251
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,399
strict about it if you are at that

252
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,200
commercial space because it might be

253
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,720
nice that you do end up getting that bud

254
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,959
but you might lose it when people are

255
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,680
handling it unfortunately I've seen that

256
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,838
a few too many times uh across this

257
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:27,319
country in Canada here uh maybe it's a

258
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,720
Canadian thing but uh yeah we've kind of

259
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,959
avoided trying to do some of those

260
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,639
things in there because when you just

261
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,039
pull it through the chalis net people

262
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,399
get you know in a a mindset and they're

263
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,759
just trying to get those plants out of

264
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,000
there so yeah I think uh I think that

265
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,679
should addend my rant at this point in

266
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,679
time I think I covered enough in there

267
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,600
yeah I love it I feel like it's such a

268
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,320
complex

269
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,040
subject and yet it never gets discussed

270
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,680
enough to me you know I love it I

271
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,439
[ __ ] love it there's so many yeah

272
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:00,039
it's the real art to me I love it and

273
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,200
depends on your cultivars [ __ ] you know

274
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,399
if you got some of those column columnar

275
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,519
ones that are just growing like this

276
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,519
instead of like that you're take that

277
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,679
differently that's what I love about it

278
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,480
too you know like it's just it is such a

279
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,319
wide open thing you can take so many

280
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,278
different ways at it and to get that

281
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,760
same height it's hilarious the different

282
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:21,360
things you can

283
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,159
do what about like negative differential

284
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,919
does anybody do negative differential to

285
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:28,278
control the height of their

286
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,159
plants put the temperature warmer at

287
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:32,159
nighttime than the day Time by two

288
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,078
degrees you control the stretch of your

289
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,919
plants that's also a real brilliant way

290
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,879
to do canopy management if you have a

291
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,838
real stretchy ass plant uh I've been

292
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,799
able to keep there's one in particular

293
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,519
it was like a super thin leaf and she

294
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,000
would do about a three to four x stretch

295
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,039
uh we're talking like we'd get to about

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,639
nine foot plants you'd go in there and

297
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,120
deaf those [ __ ] things and try to

298
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,839
keep them down but they just kept on

299
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,360
moving so yeah negative differential was

300
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,760
also another thing that I would use as

301
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,360
far as uh environment management was

302
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,039
concerned because I know that was

303
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,120
mentioned by my esteemed colleague above

304
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,639
me here it was a brilliant [ __ ] for

305
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,440
sure that's another thing you can do to

306
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:11,959
keep your plans you know a little bit

307
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,399
down yeah that's

308
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:17,278
cool I do one followup too I feel like

309
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,600
one major Nuance to me you guys didn't

310
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,439
cover you guys covered so much canopy

311
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,199
depth indoors and maybe even versus

312
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,800
Outdoors even though like kind of well

313
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,359
known that the sun penetrates all the

314
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,599
way through I feel like the the carpet

315
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,120
of canopies always an interesting muat

316
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,720
to me like some grows maybe it should

317
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,519
only be 8 in some grows maybe it should

318
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,120
be 3 feet and like sky the limit kind of

319
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,959
quite literally for sun grown I'm

320
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,879
curious what you guys think of like

321
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:49,039
canopy depth like how thick is the

322
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,039
blanket of

323
00:12:52,759 --> 00:13:00,240
flour like you're talking vertical

324
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:04,079
flowering canopy yep

325
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,519
uh yeah again uh I feel like you can

326
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,278
almost safely answer any question by

327
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,399
saying it's Nuance but like it just

328
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,480
depends on your environment to me like

329
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,879
it depends on your setup like for me if

330
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,639
if everything's cool I'm shooting for a

331
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,439
three or 4 foot freaking canopy and like

332
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,959
a six or seven foot plant and then

333
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,079
calling it there it's a tall plant but

334
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:30,359
it's a lot of flowering canopy as

335
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:33,599
well um that's just my preference and

336
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,480
like my target even like in my own grow

337
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,680
space is like roughly 3 feet of

338
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,159
flowering canopy but it takes a solid

339
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:45,239
light with you know Quality Parts to be

340
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,120
able to throw the light deep in there or

341
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,198
you know that paired with your

342
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,959
defoliation strategy also plays a role

343
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,958
but what would you say

344
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,679
Corey so I mean God it's like as big as

345
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,599
we can get them in in commercial space

346
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:07,319
you know like really just in like how

347
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,879
effective those buds actually are down

348
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,199
there uh yeah the there was that

349
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,600
Greenhouse picture that you showed

350
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:15,519
earlier there like that was it's a

351
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,278
really good thing where you can see like

352
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,159
how much we actually leave on that plant

353
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,838
which is like almost all of the [ __ ]

354
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:23,799
thing um versus like indoor where yeah

355
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,600
you're trying to like figure that part

356
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,679
out

357
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,720
essentially what I have kind of come to

358
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:29,958
the conclusion of though is if you are

359
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,079
you know number one if you're taking

360
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,799
those big leaves off you're definitely

361
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,078
really upsetting your photosynthetic

362
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,599
rate like it's just all over the [ __ ]

363
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,799
place because those leaves are solar

364
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,519
panels they're taking that goodness from

365
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,679
the Sun and creating your goodness for

366
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,278
your plant so it's really important to

367
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,679
like keep some of those but at the same

368
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:50,919
time you got to manage what's going on I

369
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,078
was really

370
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:54,838
surprised the amount of leaves on the

371
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:58,439
plant that they were leaving for sure

372
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,440
but like it was growing consistent Bud

373
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,120
definitely was not know the best of

374
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,120
quality it's you know definitely more

375
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,198
generic and that sort of says value weed

376
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,120
but the plant was consistent in that way

377
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,120
we didn't see a lot of interruptions you

378
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,919
know we were growing seven eight strains

379
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,879
of room and all of them were like pretty

380
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,278
consistent you know obviously like

381
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,559
there's some pretty basic morphological

382
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:22,480
changes that'll be there but for the

383
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,838
most part we were able to have a good

384
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,720
you know yeah 3 feet minimum um canopy

385
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:33,319
that was going down um ah I've briefly

386
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,639
talked to euben Zing at University of G

387
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:37,919
on S that [ __ ] plant gave me [ __ ]

388
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,759
powdery mildew and [ __ ] thrips and my

389
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,759
grow [ __ ] that guy who gave me that

390
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:53,799
PL nasty plant it was ended up being

391
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,800
really bad my my apologies wasn't

392
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,639
you sorry go ahead about gu oh no no no

393
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:04,519
you're good um that that's to the spider

394
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,519
mates that's like I used the other hand

395
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,839
but that's like a salute to iway way

396
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,480
that's one of the most brilliant

397
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,759
dissident artists of like all time and I

398
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,278
had a I was randomly roaming around in

399
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,000
Portugal and his um I've been trying to

400
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,318
see his art installation for like a

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,078
decade now and I was just walking down

402
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:24,639
the road and I saw that and I said you

403
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,239
got to be [ __ ] joking me he's here so

404
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,159
I just walked right in and saw it yeah

405
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,839
so yeah shout out iway way that dude is

406
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:35,198
a yeah awesome awesome dude

407
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,959
anyway I love this this is good you're

408
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,799
pulling up some uh I almost feel like

409
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,159
I'm I need to get like hot wings in the

410
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,439
hot sauce here for like the indepth [ __ ]

411
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,958
that you're coming pull that's like

412
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,600
that's a golden oldie right there that's

413
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:49,198
like almost four years ago that's

414
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,199
awesome Glow's for

415
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,159
Kobe you're ridiculous all right G

416
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,159
question go

417
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:03,799
ahead well uh it kind of it Falls in

418
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:07,240
line with the canopy depth question um

419
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:09,438
again I I shoot for a generic 3 feet

420
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,959
because I feel like I can achieve that

421
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,199
but you know to really dial it in you

422
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,400
been brought up a great point and this

423
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,880
is his recommendation alone but I'm sure

424
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,919
there's like a range like this that each

425
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,280
grower can find in their

426
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,720
facility uh but he's basically saying

427
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:31,319
you know if you peek out at 12200 ppfd

428
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,679
try to go no lower than 300 ppfd to like

429
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:35,038
en ensure a better product quality or

430
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,679
whatever I'm like okay that's a good

431
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:41,079
idea so def foliate up to a certain ppfd

432
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,480
level maybe not 300 but like I think

433
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:45,439
that that that would be an interesting

434
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,480
thing to dial like find the efficiency

435
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,798
of like where where is the flow like you

436
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,000
know starting to to get hard or you know

437
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:54,759
obviously some strains it's just

438
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,919
freaking rock hard the whole way down

439
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:59,200
but for some strains it certainly plays

440
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,400
a huge role like and things can get real

441
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,120
ly down there if you don't have those

442
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,440
ppfd targets or just like a height

443
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:09,879
Target I think is a more basic approach

444
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,798
you's way is definitely more dialed in

445
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:16,039
but I think that yeah that's got to VAR

446
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:17,879
per cultivar probably right yeah for

447
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:20,279
cultivar and I think also like again

448
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,000
like having that like same amount of

449
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,038
shoots that you're going for is really

450
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,519
key to that because then you'll find

451
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:28,879
consistency all the way through I do

452
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,558
like to shoot math for sure yeah like

453
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,000
you pinch one of your shoots one too

454
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,319
many or two too many or if like you just

455
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,599
have an imbalanced shoot in there that

456
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:39,240
whole thing is going to be different and

457
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,759
I've seen that that was you know that's

458
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,319
a really great way to troubleshoot your

459
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,200
workers you just go around your plan and

460
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,480
if you see like one branch just [ __ ]

461
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,919
monster vegging out from the other ones

462
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,798
well you notice that one definitely got

463
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,120
missed the pitch like you five of six

464
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:56,480
are flat you got this one just [ __ ]

465
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,959
given her for life so yeah it's it's

466
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,079
really important you could see those

467
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,120
that nutrient distribution if you do you

468
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,879
know feel free like I really encourage

469
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:06,319
people to try that out like if you do

470
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,159
have access to a few different plants

471
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,399
like or sorry I should say just an

472
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,120
amount of plants you know like do some

473
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,759
of those things like pinch plants at

474
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,439
different things like see what it does

475
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,599
like understand what that plants do and

476
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,840
it man it'll Advance you so quickly like

477
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,240
that was again like one of the really

478
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,558
good things about working on a place

479
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,480
with that many units I was able to do so

480
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,119
many [ __ ] experiments in the last

481
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,798
three years like even just outside of

482
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:31,279
the zamir Puna stuff and [ __ ] like I

483
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:33,000
learned so much stuff about the

484
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,440
morphology and the physiology of the

485
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,720
plan and reactions you know and it's

486
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,880
just yeah it's it's advaned so quickly

487
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,798
in my brain it's awesome

488
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,600
toxins phyto hormones Tony knows all

489
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:48,599
about phyto

490
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:56,039
hormones a couple things know about

491
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,678
all that's why I like hanging around you

492
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:02,200
smart young guys

493
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,720
I don't know I don't do any sort of

494
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,640
canopy management and I I have but the

495
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,000
reason why I don't is because I don't

496
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,320
feel like I'm getting a true expression

497
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,200
of that

498
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,879
particular plant a manipulating it like

499
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,519
when you do the low stress training and

500
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,400
all of that so I like to just saying

501
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,000
you're saying seed plants or even clone

502
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,720
plants as well I not working I haven't

503
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,519
worked with clones for quite some time

504
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,919
but even with clones I just found it

505
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,158
busy work right I'd rather just let it

506
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,240
do its

507
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,880
thing Comm well like for you have to you

508
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,960
have to because it all comes down to

509
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,640
square footage right and like so and and

510
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,200
efficiency

511
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,640
so I agree with what you guys are saying

512
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,640
but for me I just I want to see the true

513
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,640
expression and I don't want to get

514
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,759
manipulate get the true expression if

515
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,320
you don't do a hard top like if you do

516
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,640
low stress training and just you still

517
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,359
have your branches and you haven't done

518
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,759
like a destructive topping as I would

519
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,079
call what we do at the commercial space

520
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,919
like it it's still you're not really

521
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,720
like you're not inducing any like

522
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,400
pressure down into the roots to force a

523
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,839
reaction to get some nutrients out like

524
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,880
you're not I think you're still getting

525
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:22,119
the true expression even I'm not buying

526
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:24,880
a pH pen I not dry trimming my plants

527
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:28,000
and I am not training a canopy get off

528
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,320
my lawn I love that perspective Damon I

529
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,440
knew there like three very interesting

530
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:35,359
points of views I think that's cool like

531
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,278
and even a clone plant if you do get a

532
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,918
clone you'll just let it run

533
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:42,319
yeah

534
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,320
cool I'm like on the complete other side

535
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,918
man I see a clone I'm like [ __ ] top

536
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,519
it I want to take a cut right off the

537
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,640
top of it once it gets moving I'm like

538
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,480
first top is best cut give me I had a I

539
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,919
had a homie who sent me a video like I

540
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,440
didn't really used to think like this at

541
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,679
all like at least six or but like I had

542
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,038
a homie who works in a micro space like

543
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,720
micro cultivation space so he's got like

544
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:09,919
2500 square feet 3,000 somewhere in

545
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,880
there and he like as soon as he

546
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,400
transplants his clones he tops that

547
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,799
[ __ ] he just removes the AP

548
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,519
pickle right away it doesn't matter

549
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:20,240
going yeah it's really like before the

550
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,798
root like when he's like rooting his

551
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,839
plugs he's topping them or as soon as

552
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:27,558
he's transplanting them after after Ro

553
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,720
okay that's still pretty wild still yeah

554
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:31,839
no I was like I've ever goofball

555
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,319
experimented out that with that myself

556
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,038
that's pretty wild I had to get him to

557
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,960
like send the video because I was like

558
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,240
okay you're not even doing this like at

559
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,000
home you're doing it in a [ __ ]

560
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,679
commercial space like so that means you

561
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,400
had to have hit targets or else your ass

562
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,320
would have been fired by now so there

563
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,880
there has to be something something's

564
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,720
going on yeah so I got in you know I did

565
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,559
that I got some R&amp;D stuff like a couple

566
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,440
weeks ago and I [ __ ] said [ __ ] it all

567
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,079
right on transplant I'm topping let's

568
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,798
see what happens you know it is a

569
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,000
cookies variety so it is going to

570
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,158
stretch like an [ __ ] I'm certain of

571
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that so I was like well this if I'm

572
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,360
going to top one that early this is

573
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,319
going to be the one so I put on my big

574
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,278
boy pants and decided to completely go

575
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:14,798
left field and just yeah because I man

576
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:17,400
that is man if I the people who brought

577
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,639
me up in the game would hear me doing

578
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:25,240
that I apologize guys but I'm just I'm

579
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,240
doing it in the name of science promise
