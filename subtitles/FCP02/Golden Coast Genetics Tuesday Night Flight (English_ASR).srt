[Music]

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:12,779
this is the distribution

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:15,718
uh location and then also you're doing

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:19,019
the r d here and the uh

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:21,358
cross them grow them test them keep the

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,278
moms throw away everything that doesn't

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,320
make the cut

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,160
and then you want to walk down the line

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,960
here so like lemon chemicalio is

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,000
genetics I brought in

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,058
then you got laughing gas what's their

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,780
genetics we're using to breed with

15
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:42,718
chauffeur Skywalker Fire OG GDP

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,379
Long Valley Royal Kush crossed with

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,879
right Rhino manic crosses I've done

18
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,939
uh

19
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:53,420
white lemon 91 chem cross with thin

20
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,419
mints

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,719
um horchata grape grass crosswood banana

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,879
Bubba

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,140
so there's lots of stuff rents super

24
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:05,518
runts

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,859
Lemon Cherry gelatos rs11s here's some

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,780
more of the moms so what we do is when

27
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,459
the moms get about this height yeah I

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,780
have them clone them as soon as they we

29
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:16,079
throw them away

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,239
that way I'm not setting myself up for a

31
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,579
lot of problems with big moms

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,379
uh so as soon as the next one Roots

33
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,658
you'll throw yeah we'll throw these moms

34
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,819
away and start our moms over yeah so

35
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,200
every and typically how many clones do

36
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,459
you root out just to make sure you have

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,618
redundancy

38
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,899
well two two because we're pretty

39
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,118
consistent so we take two of each once

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,219
one Roots we replace it that's kind of

41
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,920
what those are your Replacements those

42
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,560
are also The Replacements and our system

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,960
is is when there's a hole punched in the

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,640
tag that means they're cloned up there

45
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,500
sorry when there's oh when you punch

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,118
them yeah so that's our way to keep

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,000
track of what's been cloned and what's

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,219
going to be exchanged out

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,379
and the plastic over the lights is

50
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,140
because

51
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:03,539
plants have a hard time handling the

52
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,040
amount of light these put out what these

53
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,840
are Nano locks yeah

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,640
and if you don't clone under these

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,459
lights and you clone under fluorescence

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,619
you get really bad Lumen shock

57
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,780
so we went through some Lumen chalk so I

58
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,280
diffuse the lights with plastic now that

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,500
they're coming back we'll get rid of the

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,800
plastic and start cloning under the LEDs

61
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,199
only not the fluorescence and so kind of

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,719
you were saying before like the goal is

63
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,119
for you to you know do breeding and

64
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,878
selection and find some cool unique

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,039
stuff that no one else has and then so

66
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,959
that way they're not all selling the

67
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,919
same stuff they have their own unique

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,439
stuff

69
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,439
and so yes these are the latest crosses

70
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,939
Germany

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,539
biscotti sherberts and rents and Lemon

72
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:58,259
Cherry gelatos and rs11s and laughing

73
00:02:54,539 --> 00:03:02,280
gas and sour monkeys and punk rock rent

74
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:06,079
crosses all kinds of stuff

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,080
these are all feminized

76
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:12,719
kind of LA's finest stuff

77
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,158
and then we'll germ here plug them and

78
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,840
then they'll come you can follow me over

79
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,139
here they'll come into this our flower

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,140
room

81
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,259
this is where we do the flowering yeah

82
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,580
which I can see this is the r d flower

83
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,939
room because you guys have the like once

84
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:42,239
you select stuff once we select stuff

85
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:44,459
the campus in Desert Valley Hot Springs

86
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,719
and it's the same lights the same same

87
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,299
lights yeah

88
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,158
yeah we only have to run four lights and

89
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,640
we're learning to do a whole tray it's

90
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,639
plenty

91
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,060
and so when are you next gonna uh put

92
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,098
stuff in here so their next session is

93
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,378
we'll clean this all out we're gonna

94
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,419
plug those little suckers in six inch

95
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,459
cubes and start rocking them

96
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,738
and then we'll run all these four tenths

97
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,239
full to find the winners out of there

98
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,860
and you have to do the hard job of

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,480
smoking at all oh yeah it's all

100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,799
downstairs the last Harvest we haven't

101
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,539
even got through that yet that's what

102
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,399
some of these are the kind of pots I

103
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,199
like uh

104
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,638
especially outdoors in La where

105
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,439
everything Peaks

106
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,300
yes

107
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,978
plants are getting big so we threw them

108
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,840
in there but normally I like to use a

109
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:34,519
rock wolf because it's pretty quick and

110
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,519
I can flush them really good yeah

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,020
yeah and then is there kind of a balance

112
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,719
between like 2 you know you have some

113
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,519
stuff that's pretty hypey but then also

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,960
some of your stuff which is you know I

115
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:50,519
view it like

116
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:54,418
the top pop 40 song meets like the 70s

117
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,639
like obscure well what you may like and

118
00:04:54,418 --> 00:05:00,120
what I may like it doesn't necessarily

119
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,900
means it applies so Joe and Derek have

120
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,639
an idea of their clientele so they gear

121
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:06,899
they help me gear my breeding towards

122
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,280
their Club what they think their

123
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:10,279
clientele is going to want yeah

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,660
very cool I mean we got old stuff from

125
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:18,599
Colombians the jalalabads there's a lot

126
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,740
of stuff in here yes some of the older

127
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,259
stuff

128
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,019
um we have the jalalabad star

129
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,180
I just crossed it to Lemon Cherry gelato

130
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:31,519
so we have a couple of those seed

131
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,519
increase of that for uh xc2

132
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:41,060
and manic calios or stuff we did that's

133
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,060
downstairs to see if we like them

134
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,060
and again these get trimmed down a lot

135
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,860
because they grow so fast and we're not

136
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,478
trying to make a bunch of clones we only

137
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,280
send a couple clones down there and then

138
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,918
they mom them out yeah

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,519
yeah what else do we have

140
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,519
manic Kelly

141
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,418
yeah

142
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:04,859
is the stuff you brought for me up here

143
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,879
can we walk through that up here do we

144
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,879
have to go that's right here

145
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,478
so you got that's sweet

146
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:18,198
and some garlic kief smell the kief even

147
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,199
is pretty crazy

148
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,139
and this is from one of the lines this

149
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,960
is the Garlic skunk that one of the

150
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,100
Mills guy did a b Mills from Humboldt

151
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,379
washed it

152
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,699
and was like freaking say like dude this

153
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:34,199
is some of the skunkiest stuff I've ever

154
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,000
tried it's super good I want to bring

155
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,978
you something I was like killer

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,759
and this is some of the dry Siff garlic

157
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,758
skunk that I made

158
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:55,519

159
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:55,519

so then you got some Albert walker dog

161
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,979
Albert Walker

162
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,560
and I put the labels on the bottom so

163
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,600
sometimes if you put them on the lids

164
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,500
you get the lids confused yeah so I go

165
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,960
with

166
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,939
super deep fire

00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,299
Colombian Haze

168
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:24,459

[Applause]

170
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:33,180
and then you got these

171
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:37,519
all right so let's I love the uh

172
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:40,918
the uh I stoled it from a 50s

173
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,959
like total it's like the early James

174
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,418
Bond like if you're reading the James

175
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,399
Bond books like or Hardy Boys or

176
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,939
something these are like they're not

177
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,038
Party Boys edgy adult comics in the 50s

178
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,139
yeah because everyone has to do with

179
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,860
chicks that are hot right I just love

180
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:02,939
the artwork like the pinup style artwork

181
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,400
this is the fun zone is I

182
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:08,240
don't know this is the super D CrossFit

183
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,239
Albert walker dog

184
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:15,180
super D these two crossed

185
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:18,419
uh this so This cross with that yep yep

186
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:22,379
okay and then this Fino Hunter

187
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:25,620
you know Hunter is the Albert Walker

188
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:28,080
James Bond heads to the Casbah right yep

189
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,500
that's the Albert Walker across with the

190
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,500
super d

191
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,360
okay and then you got the tiger eye

192
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:39,179
which is a scene increase of the Albert

193
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,918
Walker OG dog

194
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,819
down in that angle

195
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:47,100
yeah and then you got the Albert Walker

196
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,519
across that Albert walker dog which is

197
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,519
this one

198
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:59,879
and Albert Hitman is just a seed

199
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,240
increase of the Albert Walker

200
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:06,200
so that's great awesome

201
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,200
I think

202
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:12,000
very cool

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,620
yeah and some of these are pretty

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,620
pretty impressive little nuggets

205
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,680
yeah that's awesome

206
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,679
stinky

207
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,519
and this one was the Albert walker dog

208
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,519
so that would probably be your next

209
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,639
question I have no idea what dog these

210
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:44,240
are seeds from Canada Cabana from about

211
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,480
2010. yeah so

212
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,659
[Applause]

213
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:53,060
probably pretty controversial this just

214
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:53,059
reminds me of a 100 NL

215
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,519
it's a complete NL structure

216
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,799
trimmed and untrimmed

217
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,059
yeah

218
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,799
this one was one of the different

219
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,179
females a little more leavey but it's a

220
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,159
little more

221
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:20,179
kind of odds out

222
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,179
that smells awesome

223
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:27,299
a bit structure everything to me was

224
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,799
just screaming NL and it kind of makes

225
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:33,259
sense because it's from Pacific

226
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,259
Northwest right so it's very possible

227
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,060
and then what was this one this was the

228
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,060
uh Albert walker dog

229
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,919
oh gee

230
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,919
Albert walker dog Albert walker dog OG

231
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,719
and then do we have a we had a straight

232
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,479
Albert Walker right that's that one that

233
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,620
was the one I think is screaming in now

234
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,620
really mm-hmm

235
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,778
like maybe a NL four-ish three maybe

236
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,519
not too short but kind of short

237
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,220
it's got the hybrid texture the same

238
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,179
leave texture Brax Jai is a little

239
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,180
golden kinda

240
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,059
just I'm not ever familiar with an NL it

241
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,319
smelled like that but although I haven't

242
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,319
tried all the NLS either

243
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,120
and then how would you describe kind of

244
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,458
Colombians in general

245
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,019
um like from the how they grow in bud

246
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,299
structure and

247
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:48,000
we'll get to those right now so let's

248
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:50,039
look at these real quick super D fire

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,659
this is what made the garlic skunk some

250
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,399
of the parents and this is probably my

251
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,078
desert island weed any of the garlic

252
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,639
sunk or this stuff especially if you

253
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:58,639
squeeze one of the nugs yeah

254
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,899
oily super strong

255
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:11,839
just skunk

256
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,839
gas and some other kind of greatness

257
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,320
so I had a couple phinos out of the haze

258
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,759
one's a little more

259
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,879
foxtaily smells a lot more like Cali

260
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:32,519
Mist kind of sour acrity and then this

261
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,679
one's a little more dense with the

262
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,299
redder hairs probably a punto Rojo

263
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,919
possibly

264
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:42,379
and this has a little more of the

265
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,379
frankincense clove type of Honey Thing

266
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,740
if you really squeeze one you can really

267
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,039
get it

268
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:53,159
and that's most likely is what

269
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,838
made the original Haze before it goes to

270
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,159
Amsterdam

271
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,160
especially these little guys

272
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,519
yeah

273
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,139
and it's pretty Cali Misty sour kiwi

274
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:14,420
tropical acrid

275
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,419
yeah no I definitely have the tropical

276
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,720
and unsurprising it's got some good kick

277
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,100
to it

278
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:26,839
it does work for being wet from 1977 45

279
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,839
something year old seeds

280
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,220
you're covered because you like to do

281
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,959
dabs and then there's a little Keith and

282
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,959
you can do bong tokes joints whatever

283
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,600
it is huh

284
00:13:54,299 --> 00:14:00,899
so yeah that's your power pack setup

285
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:03,719
I love it do we have the uh did the

286
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:06,480
canisters come in or not yet

287
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,940
for the Kona Gold yeah I haven't ordered

288
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,300
them yet okay okay still in limbo I have

289
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,920
the Kona Gold at home but

290
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:16,559
all this is better

291
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,419
it's a lot like Mexican so I'm a little

292
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,979
worried with when people grow the seeds

293
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,319
they're going to be like oh

294
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,600
but on the same hand that's what it was

295
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,240
yeah I can't make it better than it was

296
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,360
but like compared to this

297
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,079
this is like wow smell wise all that

298
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,079
stuff right

299
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:41,360
but yeah I made a whole lot of seeds uh

300
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,360
I got a lot of them

301
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,599
so these are kind of odd because you

302
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,139
kind of get a Jackie train wrecky

303
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,000
Southeast Asian sharp sour

304
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:59,459
I notice a lot of the Southeast Asian

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,320
strains have that kind of sharp sour

306
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:04,399
thing astringent

307
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,399
real astringent

308
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,799
and same with this guy too that's the

309
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:09,179
other thing when you trim all the purple

310
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,879
leaves off that's what you end up with

311
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:15,000
green nuggets

312
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:18,679
so it's probably more of a lumen shock

313
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,679
or stress than genetic purple

314
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,459
this stuff though just so

315
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,458
sticky greasy oily

316
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,899
just like a chem structured nug

317
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,899
maybe not D but 91 and four

318
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,720
and the smell is incredible and those

319
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,500
suckers is this the same stuff that's

320
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,500
Albert Pier

321
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:55,319
it's Unique and different

322
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,059
we were talking about Albert Walker the

323
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,278
other week right

324
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:02,278
I don't know much about it that's not my

325
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:05,039
story to discuss all I know is

326
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:07,620
dirty 40 year old strain from Pacific

327
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,799
Northwest clone only they think it's an

328
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,078
Afghan skunk or something of that nature

329
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,740
but right there's fairy tales everywhere

330
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:15,739
who knows

331
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,519
all right well I'm excited

332
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,360
plus looks is one thing now you gotta

333
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,059
test drive them right

334
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,560
that's like hot looking chicks you're

335
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,239
all stoked you finally got the hot

336
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,179
chicken you get her home and she's just

337
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,419
like a boring piece of wet

338
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:46,979
Wonder Bread or something in bed

339
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:49,198
so my goal is super modern polar Stars

340
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,659
they got to be freaking bad yeah super

341
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:55,139
good looking and wild in bed that's the

342
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:57,480
whole package so that's my my breeding

343
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:00,959
goals

344
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,240
if it's good no flavor no punch it's got

345
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,778
to go if it's strong with no flavor It's

346
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,778
gotta go

347
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,259
I made some other [ __ ] I think it's

348
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,960
downstairs it smells 100 like Chinese

349
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:36,980
food oh you mentioned it yeah let me see

350
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,980
if I can find that stuff

351
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,798
I don't like it but it's such a unique

352
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,798
smell I like it

353
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,038
so this is when

354
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,980
of the pollen donors

355
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:55,558
that's biscotti sherbert

356
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,779
to say that again this is wet I reversed

357
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,899
a biscotti sherbet for a pollen donor so

358
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,819
this is the h15 is biscotti sherbert

359
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,080
give it a whiff

360
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:06,779
yep

361
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,879
so that's kind of why I went for that

362
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:12,259
this is

363
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,260
semantic Irene

364
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,419
oh that's not a good one

365
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:29,159
super Frosty super gnarly

366
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,538
kind of like a GMO real Frosty

367
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,538
indica-ish kinda

368
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,480
I like this one I've got some roadkill

369
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,460
to it

370
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,740
skunk

371
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,579
that's the white lemon 91 camel cross

372
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,579
with thin mints

373
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:55,918
firecracker burnt rubber

374
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,919
candy gas

375
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:05,240
yeah there's a there's a lot of stuff in

376
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,240
here let's just find some good one

377
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:14,160
there they grow bags

378
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:14,160
what's up Manny this is Peter Peter

379
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,038
I think that's maybe a wrench or

380
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,038
something

381
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,200
yeah

382
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,200
yes this is a garlic skunk

383
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,759
and so this is all this stuff you guys

384
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,620
are hunting through right now yeah

385
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,000
that's where you just pulled this is my

386
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:41,659
favorite plant right now that's my

387
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,660
garlic skunk

388
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,279
yep

389
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:51,080
it's like one of the closest to skunk

390
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,079
that has garlic in it

391
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,880
so this is that yeah

392
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:14,700
right I uh

393
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,400
these are the parents went and made this

394
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,298
all right so this this is the same as

395
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,059
the uh yeah so the Keef is actually that

396
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:25,379
yeah the super deep fire is the parents

397
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:26,940
that made that

398
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,500
yeah it's the same thing without the

399
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,500
garlic the super deep fired

400
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:42,619
and then which one's the Chinese uh I'm

401
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,619
looking for that still

402
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,798
for bugs

403
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:00,079
it's the mom plan or the Clones I said

404
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,079
I'm on the black table Roger

405
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,600

cabbage grease The Wonton Wrapper but

408

when you smoke it it's kind of orangey

409
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,120
sour it's actually super good when you

410
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,120
smoke it

411
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,500
yeah it's I smell I've never smelled in

412
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,500
the weed world before ever

413
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,538
yeah of course

414
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,240
I think we got some Ziplocs right here

415
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:21,900
[Applause]

416
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:25,400

417
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,400
manic patio three

418
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:45,740

419
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,399
Albert Walker garlic skunk seeds and

420
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,400

421
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,100
and there's also there's a Sharpie zip

422
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,740

uh I've been talking to these guys I was

425
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,720
like we need to make a uh

426
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:28,558
like whenever you're at an event and

427
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,480
someone gives you a nug just like

428
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,279
would be cool if they made these but

429
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,019
they had little dividers so if someone

430
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,519
gave you a nug you could slide that one

431
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,538
in there and then you could keep your

432
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,538
little nug separated

433
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,960
something like this like white that you

434
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,960

435
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:53,000

436
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,000

437
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,918

438
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:02,339

439
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,780

00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:05,779
I mean your zip lock right there

441
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:13,700

442
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,558
huh

443
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,440
I mean

444
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:24,079
it's uh hindu's making funnies that's

445
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,080
all right sarcasm I laugh uh

446
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,298
it's funny to see oh Jesus what's uh

447
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,298
what's happening

448
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,179
is this laughing ass yeah

449
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,960
it's a little one but that's that 2012

450
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,900
white lemon 91 thin mint you got to try

451
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,440
that one that's the one that gunpowder

452
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:13,740
skunky candy stuff

453
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,140
so 2012 was a strain I made in 2012 and

454
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,579
it was the White Cross My Lemon crossed

455
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,100
with 91 chem

456
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:21,658
and that's what I called 2012 because it

457
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:23,219
was 2012 and everybody thought the world

458
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,620
was going to end so I figured oh I get

459
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:29,419
to play off that

460
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:33,298
so this was 2012 what

461
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:35,600
2012 cross Thin Mints

462
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,599
good

463
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,179
manic kalio number four

464
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,918
so that's Mana Calio number two I number

465
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,919
two

466
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,860
so

467
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,500
when you are selecting through these

468
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:00,839
what did you like about them too

469
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,119
it's not as it doesn't have that

470
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,740
obnoxious smell and if you tip some of

00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,959
manic

505
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:18,179
the manic clone

506
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,179
manika some crazy clone that's similar

507
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:23,100
to OG and chem but it pre-dates them and

508
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,220
some punk rockers in Santa Barbara had

509
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:28,319
it and I only know of Oregon kid had it

510
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,000
and loved it and Fletcher had it a long

511
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,579
time ago and did some breeding with it

512
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,819
but not many other people have this

513
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:34,819
thing

514
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,959
yeah that's

515
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:49,879
very tropical

516
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,020
actually

517
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:07,740
and so what are you most excited uh

518
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:10,079
in terms of expectations of all those

519
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,359
seeds all those in that tray I'm very

520
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,639
excited about if you had to pick one

521
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,918
that you're most one of your children

522
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,720
that you're most excited about about the

523
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,179
potential

524
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,480
or most intrigued about it look it's

525
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:26,100
tough because what I like and what I'm

526
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,579
making for them in the market are two

527
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:29,579
different things so

528
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:37,158
oh that's that biscotti Sherbert it's

529
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,159
pretty it's got some zap to it

530
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,460
I think that might be trying to find a

531
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:52,820
Lemon Cherry gelato have you smelled

532
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,819
that one yet

533
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:59,119
nope

534
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,599
it's number 275 laughing gas

535
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,579
oh and it gets tough babysitting all

536
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,558
these strains man I'm like a teacher

537
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:15,480
with 80 kids in the class

538
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:17,819
I gotta remember all their names what

539
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,599
they eat all this stuff and then does

540
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:24,240
stuff get kept for long term

541
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,579
like if you guys you know thinking if

542
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,159
you're you're drawing for the commercial

543
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:31,259
Market it's like rotations but then

544
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,260
maybe sometimes coming back to stuff and

545
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:36,419
well that's what all those moms are but

546
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:38,038
at some point you'd have like 800 moms

547
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,740
because you keep

548
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:42,359
so then work like so if this one is

549
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,038
better then we have to get rid of that

550
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,918
one because this one's better and if

551
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:49,019
whoever's like like you like a king of

552
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,640
the hill whoever can stay at the top of

553
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:53,398
the hill and push the other guy out then

554
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,059
that person's out and we move on but it

555
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,058
but it could just be

556
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:02,640
like I really want the next thing well

557
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,558
the only benefit to that was it's all in

558
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,538
seed form so we could always try to pull

559
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,940
it back because everything is backed up

560
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:11,579
in seed form yeah so everything

561
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,100
be in seed form

562
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:16,798
I mean everything we see except for a

563
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:18,658
couple is all from seed right except for

564
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,579
some of the Clones that I wanted to do

565
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:22,500
the pollinations with

566
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:26,220
so this is not a good example of

567
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,140
laughing gas but that's the laughing gas

568
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,880
we have some more somewhere but I this

569
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,020
is one of my favorite I mean Lemon

570
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,020
Cherry gelato I'm sorry

571
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,599
and if you give it a good squeeze

572
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,940
I mean it's got to be it's good because

573
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,379
everybody's using it right now right and

574
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,940
everybody's trying to tease it because

575
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,840
so many people have it that's because

576
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,840
it's just good

577
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,860
so what's something that you

578
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,778
that you would love to introduce to the

579
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,639
commercial Market

580
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:15,359
that uh

581
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:18,059
the lemon irrelevant of warm white

582
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,699
people currently like what I'm hoping is

583
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:23,099
the Lemon Cherry gelato on the

584
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,200
Colombians might make something special

585
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:26,879
because of the flavor profiles and we

586
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,558
have something really old that's Pierre

587
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,200
sativa with something that's extremely

588
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,720
modern pure Indica usually when you do

589
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,399
the Indica to sativa you get really good

590
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,339
hybrid crosses

591
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:40,139
so I'm pretty anxious about that I

592
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,019
didn't bring any but the jalalabad star

593
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:46,679
is amazingly crazy

594
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:49,038
good loud weed so I did next time I'd

595
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,038
love to

596
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:54,298
I did a cross of the Lemon Cherry so is

597
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,519
this like the same Irene that's in the

598
00:32:54,298 --> 00:33:00,179
Irene Colombian uh

599
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:02,099
uh from kagu yeah okay

600
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,659
because it's it's clone only and I think

601
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:05,519
he got it from

602
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,200
we got it from Radio Ridge and I'm

603
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,200
pretty sure they're pretty reputable

604
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,340
so I kind of like these

605
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,440
like

606
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:22,579
all around this is really good weed

607
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,580
there's something for everyone

608
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,200
the garlic skunk I really like

609
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:32,099
so this is the number three the number

610
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:35,898
four

611
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:35,898
some manic yeah

612
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,440
all right

613
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,440
if I have some work to do

614
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:06,480
we have more downstairs but here's some

615
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:09,358
of the previous rounds

616
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,019
of all the seeds we've made

617
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,019
oh cool

618
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:16,039
and there there's a lot

619
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:27,740
and then I got about the same amount

620
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,740
downstairs in one of those rooms

621
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,179
so example that's how I do the crosses

622
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,980
RS 11 h15 we put them in little jars

623
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:41,780
with the tags

624
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,780
sorry Where was the rs11

625
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:52,740
and so here you have this is my system I

626
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:55,199
Mark the branches that I pollinate yeah

627
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,598
top is the plant that I pollinate bottom

628
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,879
is the pollen Donaire yeah that gets

629
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,559
clipped on the plant yeah Branch gets

630
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,380
harder and then those are the seeds from

631
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,179
we Harvest that branch and then pull out

632
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,500
the seeds and put them back in their jar

633
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:10,519
so we know

634
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,519
what's going on

635
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:15,059
example this one has a lot more

636
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,560
yeah some pollen takes a little more

637
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:18,000
some plants are a little more fertile

638
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,578
than others

639
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,480
so that's laughing gas cross with lemon

640
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,480
Cherry gelato

641
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,180
and then the branches

642
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:32,338
yeah what I do is I get the hole punch

643
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:34,259
and cut a thing and then attach it to

644
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,779
the branch oh God I gotta get it so when

645
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,579
I look in there I know where the branch

646
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,920
is

647
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:42,960
and then I have a map so if any plants

648
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,180
are next to it and I see seeds in there

649
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,820
I know what pollen it was because that

650
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:49,739
tag is next to that plant yeah

651
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,940
so we don't have any problems with

652
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:52,939
cross-pollination or nothing

653
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:04,500
yeah so you just get a

654
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:06,719
r d all day yeah just keep knocking them

655
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,539
out right use my knowledge and their

656
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,859
knowledge collect those genetics cross

657
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:27,500
them and see what we get

658
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:27,500
[Music]
