techniques Peter has been a friend of

18
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,939
mine for 44 years we were in an

19

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,260
a mentor to me helping me with my grow

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,939
and sharing his knowledge expertise and

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,859
techniques of growing high quality

24
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,779
healthy cannabis

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,640

29
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,239
fun episode to watch if just to watch us

00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,920
Circle the garden and uncover gems of

31
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,679
knowledge while checking out Peter's

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,879
growl not to mention the musical reparte

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,118

34
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:36,719
check it out

35
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:40,319
kzog classic ogila

36
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:43,259
needs three more weeks and what is the

37
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:47,279
classic OG look

38
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,459
it's too slow in the car usually kind of

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,799
dark green and the edges the leaves fold

40
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:56,639
up and you get little snow drifts on

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,299
them yeah so I think that my Formaggio

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,099
has those characteristics as well really

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,520
you can see the little the way the

44
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:07,219
leaves do that on the edge I don't know

45
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,419
this has the same

46
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:12,080
Peter always has the nicest looking

47
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,079
leaves

48
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:22,979
a very party plants

49
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,780
very forgiving very easy to grow

50
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:26,780
super sturdy branches

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,860
can grow big Casey OG yeah I think

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,540
that's a OG KZ

53
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,360

54
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:42,479

it's even darker green

59
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,799

[Music]

82
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:40,199
just like you bro and then I just put it

83
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,418
before I put it on the ground there's

84
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,759
also a cage in the ground so the Gophers

85
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:48,478
connected to it but before I did that I

86
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:51,120
dug like 20 gallons out and put some

87
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,219
it's old soil and put some of that

88
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,199
tomato

89
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,419
fertilizer in there

90
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,699
and wet it and then set it on top so now

91
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:02,099
it's growing into the ground

92
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,379
oh that is excellent happier yeah yeah

93
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,939
to grow into the ground yeah yeah you

94
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,740
can grow trees if you grow in the ground

95
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,180
I'm forgiving too because it always has

96
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,180
more how's the soil here well

97
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:20,040
it's like sand super fine and hard

98
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,620
uh-huh it holds water forever right so

99
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,539
you have to mend it yeah it's like sand

100
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,069
it should Dig Down

101
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:30,539

look at it's [ __ ] beautiful

109
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,620
if you see this when the sun gets over

110
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,300
there it just gets all white

111
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,800
what are the tall ones in the back well

112
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,900
let's go around this way and then we'll

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,759
get to the back I suppose

114
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,138
which way do you want to go Petey gosh

115
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,580
this is

116
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,579
and the fruity tree

117
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,680
favorite flavor

118
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,699
oh my God

119
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,259

I don't know you tell me

121
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,818
they're all different

122
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,400
this one's a more of a sativish looking

123
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,319
whereas this one's more OG looking right

124
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,659
oh my God this reminds me of something

125
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,000
that holds old

126
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,259
something else this is more OG looking

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,459
you know what I'm saying yeah yeah yeah

128
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:13,080
yeah the fluffier this is nice even

129
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:15,299
supposedly a 70 Indica 30 sativa mix but

130
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,839
it grows like sativa and my fingers are

131
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,840
all sticky

132
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,220
they're both three blue Kings different

133
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,319
yeah tell us about your pruning method

134
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,660
Peter

135
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,860
as you can see I stripped the bottoms

136
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,460
out

137
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,340
um

138
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,318
you can look right through them

139
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,719
come out here and see the ants going up

140
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,199
and you're going

141
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,840
let's see I got the tangle foot tangle

142
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,360
foot tangle foot no way up into the cap

143
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,159
canopy but when they get up there boy

144
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,199
they go on the highway and they just

145
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,199
will spread out through all the the

146
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,660
canopy yeah yeah yeah oh my God

147
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,180
in my ropes and what are they doing up

148
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,939
there when they do go up there they Farm

149
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,340
aphids right and they turn into the

150
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,079
scale right aphid scale I'm not sure

151
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:08,758
what it is but no the scale is a

152
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,839
different thing I think they Farm those

153
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,000
too right

154
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,818
they milk those things

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,519
yeah averies are different than the

156
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,379

172
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,519
as far as

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,100

174
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,210
leaves the farm seas and they form on

175
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,298

196
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,000

donkey dick structure but not really

202
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,720

203
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:53,879

204
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,800

00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:17,338
little sprayer like ow

228
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,519
clean Liberty blue Kings so three months

229
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,379
and three days old okay all this was

230
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,078
just

231
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:30,659
so let's for people that haven't

232
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,620
actually watched a prior episode with

233
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:36,360
you

234
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:40,560
this is Peter G of Casa Verde Farms

235
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:43,399
Rancho Verde Rancho Verde okay

236
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,819
and I started in the cloth pots here

237
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,039
[Music]

238
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,379
and as they grow I can shift them around

239
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,419
which one I want to plant where you just

240
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,519
drop them right in the soil

241
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:55,919
and they just grow right through and you

242
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,980
built these beds I think I started in a

243
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:03,179
little cloth pot eventually I dropped it

244
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,039
into a 20 gallon cloth pot and you cut I

245
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,479
do cut slits in the bottom of the pots

246
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,500
but they still grow right through them

247
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,440
yeah

248
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,600
it's the handiest thing in the world I

249
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,360
just did that my first time one of your

250
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,899
tricks then I pushed soil all all around

251
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,060
it uh-huh you know I'll put some kind of

252
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:24,240
reconstituted amendment now do you have

253
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:27,539
to water all three of those yeah use

254
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,579
water right into the first one yeah and

255
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,740
then go around it but then the the other

256
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:34,379
side you're like the rest of it stays

257
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,500
moist also though right huh it seems

258
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,539
like the outer soil also stays moist is

259
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,879
that water it outside the thing too yeah

260
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:45,120
my water I pour like four gallons in

261
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:48,000
uh-huh I pour two or three gallons

262
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,278
around it takes I see seven or eight

263
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,059
so I'm going to do 12 gallons for the

264
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:56,720
bigger plants and how often do you water

265
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,719
every

266
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,439
every four days unless they're in a pot

267
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,540
and they're not in the ground then I do

268
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,639
them every day to have every other day

269
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:11,240
if I'm lucky yeah yeah I'd do the same

270
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,240
over here

271
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,419
this one

272
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,220
letting it dry out I'm picking it

273
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,699
tomorrow because it's just too down so

274
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,700
it's starting to rot and it is what

275
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,700
uh-huh

276
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,259
this was an off to the side part it was

277
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,819
started in like one gallon then I put it

278
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:36,860
in like a three gallon I kept on

279
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,860
dropping in a bigger cloth pots

280
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:42,240
concentric rings

281
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:45,259
just [ __ ] hard makes it harder for an

282
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,259
ant to crawl in there

283
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:51,539
oh speaking events what is your uh

284
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,399
smaller pots and I just keep dropping it

285
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:56,519
into a bigger pot and you're just

286
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:59,278
filling around it and just

287
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,560
the way to go

288
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,299
see what I'm saying yeah and you use

289
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,698
white plastic to keep the heat off your

290
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,278
pots yes I do yeah a little bit of

291
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:10,319
tangle foot

292
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,360
I believe like Pine tour you get a new

293
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,740
hardware stores okay first you put a

294
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,720
little tape around it and then you put

295
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,459
it on the tape right but then the add

296
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,079
let the ants live in the pots because

297
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,619
they're good for the soil they make

298
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:25,620
little trails and yeah they'll eat other

299
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,240
insects from living in your soil yep yep

300
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,039
yep it's just as long as they don't come

301
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,860
up into the buds I'm good with them yeah

302
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,719
they can not get up I will sometimes

303
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,360
they find their way up this pole and

304
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,300
along this wire oh yeah I watch for that

305
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,300
like in here they did that they came up

306
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:44,519
this pole over here

307
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:46,799
there's no way for them into the canopy

308
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:50,879
without having to go over the school I

309
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:53,399
got all these goo there who there

310
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,799
cross over here yeah which I leaned into

311
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,480
earlier in there has the little goo

312
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,099
around the bottom and they just can't

313
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,159
get up there oh yeah I see they're all

314
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,120
stuck on it as well there's some kind of

315
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,120
insect stuck on it

316
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,459
dirt but as you were saying this year

317
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:18,539
there's less insects right

318
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:21,119
yeah in general I got aphids but they

319
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:22,319
come off the bamboo over there I just

320
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,440
got my

321
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,420
bug sprayer out my airless and sprayed

322
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,699
all the bamboo on the other side of my

323
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,259
enclosure

324
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:32,939
the Bougainvillea doesn't pose any

325
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:35,458
problems

326
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,800
and this used to be all open now I

327
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,500
planted the boat in Via and the yuccas

328
00:16:37,799 --> 00:17:04,678

five

334
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:23,160
and here we have the concentric circles

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,679
of potting

336
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,419
and the outer

337
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,419
bed of soil

338
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,440
I think I started off in a plastic pot

339
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,418
and I just sliced it down the side

340
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,860
I should have taken it off but it

341
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,740
doesn't matter

342
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:43,859
yeah I cut the bottom off it and sliced

343
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,700
it all the way down one side

344
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,699
oh that's cool

345
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:55,259
it's dropped in the pot another pot and

346
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,779
then in here it's growing into 200

347
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:00,240
gallons of soil right that's why it gets

348
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,038
so big it's just endless

349
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,160
repo forever

350
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:07,200
takes right 12 gallons every time I

351
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,720
water it now let me ask you another

352
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,080
question at the end of the season do you

353
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:17,279
pull the pots out of the beds

354
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:19,798
no I'll let the roots rot and just at

355
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,879
the beginning and next Four Season I'll

356
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,839
just

357
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,860
twist that stem out of the soil uh-huh

358
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:31,558
and mix it up and then I get a new

359
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:34,199
bag a couple cubic feet of

360
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,700
new soil right which is I've been using

361
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,700
Aurora

362
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,700
original mix or something anyway so

363
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,500
and I put that in the pots and all the

364
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,940
stuff around it is reconstituted soil

365
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,339
from the year before

366
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,160
and next year I'll push it off into that

367
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:55,500
way and sometimes I carry it out of here

368
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,279
uh-huh

369
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,279
very cool

370
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:12,538
yeah you put the amendment in the old

371
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:14,280
soils Home Depot tomato whatever they

372
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:16,558
call it

373
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,740
which is organic

374
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,839
microbes and all that uh-huh

375
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,640
this one I just dropped on another pot

376
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,298
and she's rolling down into the other

377
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,299
one I'm sure

378
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,340
you see she's

379
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,419
[Music]

380
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,418
she looks very happy

381
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,440
so we go there's no cut through kind of

382
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:39,440
is there

383
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,400
what is my look at the difference a

384
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,439
little tanning held

385
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,720
[ __ ] bro it's so bright I can't see what

386
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,038
I'm filming but I hope I'm getting this

387
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,038
on that one oh my goodness

388
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:05,639
look at that fluffy

389
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,960
three pounds of fluff

390
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,720
every year my three pounds of flour

391
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,179
is it it's huge bro

392
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,460
the Jazz look at it it just goes like

393
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,340
Haze right

394
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,440
very strong smoke the the THC uh

395
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,119
trichomes are actually smaller on the

396
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,640
tree blue Kings where some of the

397
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:29,579
indicas are big trichomes you know what

398
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,559
I'm saying but this is a very it's very

399
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:33,960
Stony

400
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:37,019
look at the lineage yeah

401
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,980
look at that plant okay let's just let's

402
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,980
get it from this side

403
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,579
oh my God

404
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:55,740
yeah what's under here Peter more soil

405
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,960
waiting for something

406
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,058
but over here gets blocked out

407
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,940
uh-huh

408
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:06,440
nice having an open space

409
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,440
for here when they get crowded

410
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,179
The Vault sorry

411
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:17,700
that's the three months

412
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:21,259
three months and three days

413
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,259
how does the plant do that

414
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:29,279
something must be done right

415
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:31,559
90 days Petey from seed to [ __ ] bud

416
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,139
unreal

417
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,798
yeah you did start late

418
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,799
June

419
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,000
all of them are kind of massive bro

420
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:49,379
and of all your fertilizer what you you

421
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,380
would say how much percentages organic

422
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:57,179
I start out using Advanced Nutrients

423
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,220
they're full line

424
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,440
I use very little nutrient on grow

425
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,259
because there's so much in the soil I'm

426
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:09,419
also using in between liquid nutrient

427
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:13,619
feeding I will use a Aurora dry nutrient

428
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:15,299
feeding so whole feed schedule so it's

429
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,058
just attack them with everything they

430
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:20,579
don't seem to uh get them as Hardy as I

431
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:23,940
can when they start butting

432
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:28,319
and then I switch to only organic Aurora

433
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:30,840
dry nutrients organic

434
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,339
something looks like it was done right

435
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,579
here for sure

436
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:38,759
the whole garden actually flush I use

437
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,859
flushing agent from

438
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:43,158
Advanced Nutrients called Flawless

439
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,158
finish

440
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,918
good or bad I don't know but

441
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,600
interesting everything they do seems to

442
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,340
work pretty well

443
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,019
I think going this way is probably not

444
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,879
the best idea

445
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:00,679
of the

446
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,679
let's come down the other rows

447
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:08,640
[Music]

448
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:23,900
foreign

449
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:23,900
[Music]

450
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:31,280
there is another one of those kzs which

451
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,280
you can see this one here

452
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,419
the one next to its sugary

453
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,880
different

454
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:44,460
same string

455
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,240
and you you planted all these at the

456
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,240
same time or what

457
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:55,620
Norm I started later like a week or like

458
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,779
June 25th or something

459
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:00,619
probably some of the smaller ones who

460
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:00,619
knows yeah

461
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,140
this is a vertical stack you're always

462
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,720
like I better plan a few more because I

463
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,240
know bro right yeah then you end up with

464
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,860
too many I know well and then you don't

465
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,259
want to kill them I have very small

466
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:23,939
plants this year so I'm except for my

467
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,038
own genetics

468
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,440
and you know I have to grow small in my

469
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:31,558
own little hoop house anyway

470
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,360
yeah you're uh I'm limited not a lot of

471
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:35,220
sun it's a hard place

472
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,019
yeah stuck in between

473
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,240
up in our hearts

474
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:43,158
but you know

475
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,159
but you make it work I make it work

476
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,220

483
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,798
feeding this is a giant kg from

484
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,819

I didn't mean to squeeze your bud so

493
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,400
hard I hate when people do that to my

494
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,178
buds

495
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,179

knees right yeah I'd say OG has a sativa

505
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,400
element right

dog seeds

642
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:53,099
humble seed organization so you've only

643
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:54,480
the source of all your plants are two

644
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:57,418

645
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,179

00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,140
pretty nice though right

648
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:12,838
it's flushing it for two weeks and it

649
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:14,940
wouldn't get yellow

650
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:18,418
I actually fertilized it again today

651
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,740
like one more did I

652
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:24,898
think so

653
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:26,638
yeah these outside ones I I play with

654
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:28,259
I did something right

655
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,320
they're growing in a pot it's pretty

656
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,080
nice huh absolutely bro

657
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,719
20 gallon pot this is what mine's going

658
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,848

[Music]

660
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,838
could be the weather here it has

661
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,549
something to do with these but I think

662
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:45,960
it's more of your growing technique

663
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,720
[Music]

664
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,139

your head

673
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:13,559
from this watering and

674
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,760
of course you'll watch the plants if it

675
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:17,338
shows some

676
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,240
sign of stress like all your hair start

677
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:23,880
turning brown start flushing it

678
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:26,338
right because they will turn down if

679
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,260
with heat or something yeah too many new

680
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:30,239
transactions when I was flushing this

681
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,300
pot I tested the runoff

682
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:36,539
and it was like

683
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:38,579
1900 PPM like wow oh my gosh that's

684
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:40,440
really a lot maybe even more I can't

685
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:42,300
remember some outrageous number and I'd

686
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,440
indicating that it's got too much in

687
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,660
there

688
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,079
last runoff I got when I flushed it was

689
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:52,078
like 900 or the one before it anyways

690
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,780
right enough water you're starting to

691
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,640
turn brown you got to cut you down sign

692
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,040
them in the barn and this middle one is

693
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,659
what it what is this one it's another

694
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,880
crazy OG

695
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:05,578
that's how it usually looks the same as

696
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,858
this one yeah look how black to me is

697
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:10,200
the classic OG structure

698
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:12,779
the blueberry muffin looks like it's a

699
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,659
lighter color right and pinkish you see

700
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,460
pink he's in there it's also got the red

701
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:20,219
um same thing as last year on the bigger

702
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,960
shade leaves Leaf stems

703
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,879
it's like it needed some more or

704
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,699
something

705
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,838
the whole thing it's like malnourished

706
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,059
all right

707
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:33,900
I can fertilize the [ __ ] out of it and

708
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:38,480
put dry organic nutrients on it

709
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,480
I'm just flashing it looks like candy

710
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,300
I hope it is here it's

711
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,619
cool

712
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,300
