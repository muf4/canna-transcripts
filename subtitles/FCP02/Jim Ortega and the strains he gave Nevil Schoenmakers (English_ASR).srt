1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,480
this week's subject that we're going to

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,960
chat about um is sort of there was there

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
was a there was a guy okay so at the

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,599
time there was a guy there was a guy

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,039
that uh that ended up giving Neville uh

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,759
four different

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,160
lines okay and those things ended up

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,118
permeating a bunch of Neville's hybrids

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,278
and crosses and things like that right

10
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:31,320
and they they're pretty important even

11
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:33,280
today so we thought we'd talk about it

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,119
right and so today's edition in our

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,960
reoccurring series on cannabis history

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,238
is going to be about uh Jim Ortega and

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,920
the strains that he gave Neville and

16
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:49,718
sort of what happened with those yeah

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:52,879
okay um so when in the mid 80s when

18
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,600
Neville started his Seed Company um he

19
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:58,039
garnered a bunch of interest from

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,280
Americans right um which is how he ended

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,039
up trading with a bunch of them and sort

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,359
of like filling out his diversity of his

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,280
seed stock from people okay

24
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,879
and one of the people that was

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,599
interested in what he was doing was this

26
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:14,039
guy I don't believe this is his real

27
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:18,359
name but you know uh we they called him

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:22,439
Jim Ortega okay yeah and he gave Neville

29
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:25,840
um the maple leaf Indica the garlic

30
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,758
Bud um the Kush

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,600
four and the Hawaiian the there was

32
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:36,759
something called Hawaiian IND

33
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:40,319
those four things right um and so I

34
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,879
guess we'll start with uh we'll start

35
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,919
with the things that and so here's the

36
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:49,239
gig right um here's the

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,879
gig the history of this so as far as I'm

38
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:58,118
aware okay um we'll call him Jim Jim is

39
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:01,319
alive right um but Jim is alive and he

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:04,280
has periodically although fairly rarely

41
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:08,280
popped up on the interwebs and added

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:13,280
some depth to things but he has not uh

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,719
really laid out a ton of History um this

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,000
was somebody asked what year is this I

45
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,719
would say this is in the in the mid 80s

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,959
mid mid to late 80s okay I would just

47
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,878
based on how Neville operated I would

48
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,759
imagine that he probably got this stuff

49
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:30,639
from mortega probably around 86 because

50
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,598
he was he was good on it he was

51
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,799
definitely moving his process along like

52
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,679
if he got something within the next one

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,280
or two years it would be introduced to

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,040
his program it would end up in the

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,080
catalog there wasn't a big gap and 86 is

56
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,439
the year with it still has all the [ __ ]

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,800
[ __ ] has the stuff from [ __ ] Dave

58
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,639
Watson it has all that too so most of

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,000
what we know about these lines comes

60
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:58,878
from Neville working them into releases

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,439
that he made okay and then much much

62
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,000
later than that

63
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:07,840
uh on the Mr Nice forum and say like the

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,158
200920 era Neville popped up on the

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,158
Forum and started chatting for a couple

66
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,199
of years yeah uh and that is where the

67
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:18,719
vast ma the vast majority of what we

68
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,719
know okay about this comes from that

69
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,039
right and so this is an interesting

70
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,359
thing because like when you talk about

71
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,919
Cana history there are probably people

72
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,920
that are still alive out there that know

73
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:32,559
far more than we do about the origins of

74
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,878
these things where they came from what

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,799
they were mixed with all this different

76
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:41,919
stuff but that has not been you know

77
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,239
made public right no so we don't know

78
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,559
those things so what we know is

79
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,200
basically from Neville getting them what

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,560
he saw in the seed lines and deciding

81
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,719
and what he decided to say about them

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,079
and his educated

83
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,239
guesses and you know one of the things

84
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,000
that is so cool about these specific

85
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,560
lines is that because they were so

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,759
prolific in their time and across the

87
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,280
Dutch Market not only do we have things

88
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,560
that he said but in the case of things

89
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,399
like garlic Bud that became we can say

90
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,160
that but um in the case of things like

91
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,478
garlic bud and what they become you have

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
this huge range of people that had grown

93
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,639
them over many many years who have their

94
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:29,839
own anecdotes you know all of those

95
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,079
lines barring a few were sold you know

96
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,918
just saying that like whether or not Jim

97
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,839
made them all whether or not he was the

98
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,399
middleman and he acquired them from

99
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,399
different friends and pass them

100
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,719
along their origin story starts with him

101
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,439
giving them to Neville well maybe we

102
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,800
should start there because one of the

103
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:54,038
few anecdotes we have of a previous time

104
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,199
was Neville's rundown in that 90 catalog

105
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,879
when he said oh the Afghan mix came from

106
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,400
the collection of someone named Maple

107
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,038
Leaf Wilson

108
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,560
and who that is who that may be we don't

109
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,759
know but that seems like it is the only

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,000
singular piece of that story that

111
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,800
precedes him actually looking through

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,120
the lines and that story may or may not

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,439
be what Jim Ortega told Neville and

114
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,879
that's and that's very true because

115
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:25,959
these seeds come from America Neville's

116
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,680
not from America he's from Europe right

117
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:31,159
and it appears that you know he mailed

118
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,000
him to him right

119
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:39,680
so um we will start I get I'm going to

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,720
start backwards right and we'll start

121
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,759
with the the two we'll start with the

122
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,919
two that I feel like have I don't want

123
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,479
to say the least impact but got used the

124
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:52,359
least right okay um yeah so Neville had

125
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,199
this Hawaiian

126
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,319
indicia

127
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:01,038
okay we don't know all its permutations

128
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,160
of what happened with it okay but it

129
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:07,439
appears that Neville took this line and

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,319
he crossed it to nl1 okay which was what

131
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:13,519
he kind of did to most things back then

132
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,879
nl1 was sort of like the only like in

133
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,639
seed form pure kush variety that he you

134
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,959
know pure Indica variety that he had um

135
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,800
so he crossed Hawaiian Inda to nl1 and

136
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:28,038
then he released it as Hawaiian indicia

137
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:32,598
by nl1 yeah and there's picks of it in

138
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:34,439
his seed bank um later on um it got

139
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:38,038
released under Sensei although they

140
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,680
dropped the byy nl1 and just sold it as

141
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:43,199
Maple Leaf or they sold it as Hawaiian

142
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,759
Inda yeah without without any of the

143
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,759
qualifiers that it had been Blended

144
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,720
right right and there are some pictures

145
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,120
in Neville's old cataloges and different

146
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,400
things like that of this strain okay

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:00,240
yeah um you know it's it's possible that

148
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:04,038
it ended up in some of s sees later

149
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,759
works and some certain later hybrids um

150
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,079
but it sort of appears a little bit as

151
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,280
sort of like a

152
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,279
singular yeah right we don't know for

153
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,439
sure that it permeated through other

154
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:21,038
work no right um and

155
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,279
so that was one of them yeah another one

156
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,240
that he gave was this thing called Kush

157
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,758
for okay which we didn't know very much

158
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,000
about at all until Neville started

159
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,840
posting in

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,560
200920 okay um and what that stuff seems

161
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:43,439
to be is according to Neville it was

162
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,120
kind of a cushy line and he um crossed

163
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,000
it to what he considered his other Kush

164
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,079
line that he had which was nl2 and he

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,478
released something the last two or three

166
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:57,560
years of his seed bank um called Kush by

167
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,240
kush yeah okay it would it would also

168
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,759
seem there was actually a section of

169
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,120
that as well because when you saw I

170
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,680
guess what we're supposed to believe is

171
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,680
the final iteration of his work that was

172
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,519
available the Orga one two and three

173
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:17,360
lines that um gosh kit from Legends was

174
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,959
the one selling early 2000s yeah one you

175
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,240
know they were all you know NL early

176
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:26,359
hybrids with the oran stuff but one of

177
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:30,598
them was I think it was the two was it

178
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:34,038
the one that I [ __ ] had but I'm using

179
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,718
my I have I have screenshots of of the

180
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,759
makeup of all those of all those ones

181
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,519
from later on but they're on my phone

182
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,639
and I'm using my phone right now to chat

183
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,480
with everyone so I can't look but um but

184
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,799
you can go look in Neville's old

185
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,680
cataloges probably about 89 90ish right

186
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:53,479
and you'll see something called Kush by

187
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:59,120
kush yeah which later he clarified was

188
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:02,079
kush for by nl2 right right and um you

189
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,278
know and he believes you can take this

190
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:08,759
for what you will he believes that the

191
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,600
what we consider Kush in in our OG Kush

192
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,120
TK all that different stuff he felt that

193
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,480
stuff looked so similar to it it was

194
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,759
probably descended from it I mean he

195
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,600
went so far as to say that he believed

196
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:25,240
that OG Kush was just

197
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,680
nl2 which is interesting

198
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:32,480
because we have a more common like

199
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:36,239
metric for what nl2 looked like through

200
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,720
Oasis then original packs of nl2 and

201
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,680
when you compare them it's so night and

202
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,959
day what came out of Oasis never looked

203
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:48,519
like OG um and it makes me wonder what

204
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,319
we hadn't seen of nl2 that made him so

205
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,480
convinced that OG that he saw in his

206
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,240
later years oh this is just [ __ ] I me

207
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,639
he might have he might have picked he

208
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,919
might have picked a

209
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:04,720
particularly cushy in his mind look

210
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:08,719
to cross to the Kush um I have a I have

211
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,720
a screenshot from from uh from Mr Nice

212
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,440
where he literally says he believes that

213
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,639
hybrid is the foundation of today's Kush

214
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,000
lines whether or not that's true I can't

215
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,399
say I I I never bought those lines from

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,159
him I don't have any personal experience

217
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,480
so but that's what he said okay yeah I

218
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,159
could you know I tried desperately to

219
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:32,200
get those [ __ ] Ortega 2 f2s that

220
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:36,278
[ __ ] G slot [ __ ] uh may just

221
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,480
made I got the [ __ ] I got the Ortega

222
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:41,000
to hybrid up that was how I made purity

223
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,920
ring all this but like I couldn't get

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,720
any of those f2s up and I knew they were

225
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:48,078
like 22 years old when I tried to pop

226
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,320
them but like I I took my best stab at

227
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,958
trying to see what the [ __ ] was there in

228
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,560
a in a lost era just failed we don't we

229
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:58,119
don't really know those were a seed line

230
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,838
that was available for probably three

231
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,399
four years right right and um you know

232
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,880
he made some comments about what the you

233
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,958
know he clarified what was in it years

234
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,639
later and he made some comments about

235
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,078
what he thought about it but that's not

236
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,680
really um that's really all we know

237
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,239
about it right okay um and I will say

238
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,319
that we should probably take a moment

239
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,159
because I feel like most people's idea

240
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,800
of kush for now is a plant that looks

241
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:31,078
very very similar to Bubba Kush and has

242
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,039
been shared with VAR people I know CSI

243
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:37,479
has it I know bod has it I know they

244
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:40,879
both made hybrids with it but in

245
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,920
that is that what kush for was

246
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,759
originally we don't know is that

247
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,838
something that someone was like hey this

248
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,919
is this is kush for you know this this

249
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,440
is it and it it's hard to say so even

250
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:56,159
metrics we should have today how

251
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,040
reliable they are we we can't say I mean

252
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,759
there's also a thing too for a few years

253
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,039
I haven't seen it much lately but there

254
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,799
was percolating around collector circles

255
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,399
about seven or eight years ago there was

256
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:10,278
a kush for clone that that's what I'm

257
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,000
talking about yeah that was that was

258
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:17,639
reputed to be um you know from that or

259
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,120
whatever um but it's very you know it's

260
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,560
just it's just soaked in mystery from so

261
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,759
long ago right and you know out of all

262
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,078
the things that Jim did say when he came

263
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,399
back if anyone needs to find things that

264
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:34,239
Jim said or post he posted as dog

265
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,278
on a number of forums um but out of all

266
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,959
the things that he did say and some of

267
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:41,320
them

268
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:44,159
were a little much I mean uh he never

269
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,079
verified that that cut that goes around

270
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:51,958
and it no no he did not he he did never

271
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:55,958
came up he did pop up on on the forums

272
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:58,838
over there and um he did clarify what he

273
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:01,399
sent Neville and they did do some back

274
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:04,720
and fourths and stuff and so it seems

275
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:06,039
like it happened right the next two

276
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
things that I'm going to talk about or

277
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,240
we're going to talk about are things

278
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:14,600
that are sort of the meat and potatoes

279
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:18,079
of what Ortega gave Neville in the sense

280
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,440
that they got much more widely used and

281
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,278
they're much more familiar to people and

282
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,480
so I think I'll leave the big one for

283
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:31,519
last but the third thing that he gave um

284
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,680
was garli garlic Bud yep and Neville had

285
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,000
a whole bunch of thoughts about garlic

286
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:40,359
Bud yeah right Neville called garlic Bud

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,639
a pre- Sam

288
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,159
skunk yeah which probably irritates the

289
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,519
piss out of Sam if he's listening um but

290
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:52,159
uh sorry uncle those those guys are

291
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,120
those guys are the those guys are uh the

292
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:59,519
original weed beef right so not to tap

293
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,120
into that I wasn't there I I was a child

294
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,399
or whatever but um as well but when it

295
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,959
comes down to it um what we do know is

296
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:16,120
that is that Neville sold garlic Bud as

297
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:18,039
a line okay for um for very um you know

298
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,879
he sold it in his in his seed bank

299
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:24,559
company okay and um he put pictures of

300
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,120
it and he said it was a very high

301
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:30,799
yielding you know donkey dick as as you

302
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:34,919
like to as people like to say sometimes

303
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:39,399
uh donkey dick style buds okay and he

304
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:41,759
viewed it as a skunk Arc Type yeah would

305
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,240
you say interesting what's interesting

306
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,240
especially with the garlic is because we

307
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,399
don't have an exact distinction about

308
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,519
how Neville received all of the seeds

309
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,639
that we're talking about there is a

310
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:57,480
chance that what we call Garlic bud and

311
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,399
what we call you know Maple Leaf in

312
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,399
reference to you know the Afghan in the

313
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:05,639
Afghan s might have actually just been

314
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,240
the same group of seats yeah we don't we

315
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:12,959
we we we know what we know what they

316
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:16,480
told us okay and so um so garlic Bud was

317
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,479
widely sold by Neville okay it was very

318
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,879
popular because you can go back and look

319
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,480
at the catalog and they just have this

320
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,480
picture of this plant with this mon

321
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,120
monster colos monster side branching

322
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,720
resinous very very pretty all that type

323
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,039
of stuff it was very popular okay he

324
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,319
crossed it um into all kinds of things

325
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:41,198
um because it had that as he likes to

326
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:42,919
call it uh donkey dick style buds right

327
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,359
certain

328
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:50,278
Gena and so and so we'll we'll jump

329
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,959
ahead briefly okay okay so when Neville

330
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:55,720
got bust when Neville got busted and he

331
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,719
ended up having to

332
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:03,239
sell up having to sell his company

333
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,959
to um to the dronkers right and sell his

334
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,198
seed stock to sensey all right sensey

335
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:15,638
did not want to just make it seem like

336
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:18,879
their company was a um direct Port from

337
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,720
Neville would you say that's fair any

338
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,600
yeah no it's absolutely accurate but I

339
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,560
mean it

340
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:32,199
was um so what they did okay is they

341
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:35,039
changed the name of garlic Bud to Shiva

342
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:38,318
Shanti yep okay named after Ben's

343
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:41,159
daughter right yeah and Shiva Shanti was

344
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:43,719
sold a lot longer than garlic Bud was

345
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,480
right the interesting thing about that

346
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,959
and this is a whole story in itself is

347
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,278
that since he was lazy enough they uh

348
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:55,278
they didn't change the picture they

349
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:57,078
didn't change the advertisement like the

350
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,639
they did change the they did change the

351
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:03,000
advertisement but they mostly the same

352
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,798
verbiage in language yeah it's very

353
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,720
direct they took a few sentences out

354
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:12,918
right and they changed some names okay

355
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,439
so garlic bud is Shiva Shanti so it's a

356
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:19,240
direct it's a it's a direct Port right

357
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,519
it is although I'm not exactly sure and

358
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,318
I don't know if it's ever been clarified

359
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,679
by anyone close but there is a Shiva

360
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:29,038
Shanti one and two um yes there was a

361
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,720
more Afghan version of Shiva Shanti that

362
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,319
came out later right I wonder how each

363
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,880
one of those was made like was one you

364
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,639
know f2s of a different mom than

365
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,919
whatever however the sad thing about the

366
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,960
dronkers is that they're both still

367
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:49,600
alive right and they're a they they

368
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,679
could be an immense Fountain of

369
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:56,199
Knowledge and historical information and

370
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,360
they basically decided to say ceny is

371
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,000
the exact same it's always been all the

372
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:02,038
parents are are the exact same they've

373
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,200
always been all the lines are the exact

374
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:08,720
same they've always been by from Sensei

375
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,480
we're the ogs right which is not

376
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,440
particularly help like so not

377
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:18,120
helpful so garlic Bud Shiva Shanti right

378
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,679
because of the length of time that it

379
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:23,199
was sold as seed

380
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,880
stock ended up probably in a lot more

381
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,360
weed than most people think it ended up

382
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,440
in all kinds of hybrids it ended up in

383
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,279
all kinds of stuff from you know Neville

384
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,320
gave a bunch of the stock from from

385
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:39,599
shant from to Shanti right um so Jim

386
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:41,798
Ortega giving the garlic line to there

387
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:45,119
was a version of Black Domina that had

388
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:47,480
garlic in it um yeah there was a there

389
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,359
was a lot of uh there was a lot of

390
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:55,480
things that permeated from that right

391
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:58,359
sure and it's still sold today okay um

392
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,679
but what most people don't know is that

393
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:03,879
when they bought the company most of the

394
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,440
things that they sold at Sensei were

395
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,159
large amounts of Neville's seed

396
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,919
stock right that he had already made and

397
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,520
they didn't actually make anything new

398
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,600
for the first three or four years that

399
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,798
they bought the company right they just

400
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:24,079
sold stock that he they had already

401
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:25,839
purchased right so probably the last two

402
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,759
two two three years I can't remember if

403
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,959
it was 88 or ' 89 that he came out with

404
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,038
it but the last two or three three years

405
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,159
you could buy garlic Bud from the seed

406
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:39,519
bank and then proba and then probably

407
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:41,840
from like 90 to 95 you could BR 91 to 95

408
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,279
you could Bry Shiva Shanti that was

409
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:47,599
probably the same damn seed stock

410
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:51,279
probably you know direct from from

411
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:54,158
Neville okay and so that that bud from

412
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,839
Jim Ortega made a huge impact because

413
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,679
tons of people bought Shiva I mean

414
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,639
there's rumors that like for instance

415
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:04,159
the Ohio dumpster

416
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,240
is a is a is a Shiva Shanti feno um it's

417
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:11,240
probably in a lot more things than we

418
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:14,200
think probably yeah in all

419
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,679
H you know probably honestly it's

420
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,480
probably in a lot more things than we

421
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:23,400
than than we think and so um and so you

422
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,319
know the um I'm ignoring tons of

423
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,038
comments guys because I'm trying to stay

424
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:31,359
focused on what we're chatting you know

425
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:34,279
so uh I'll get distracted and I'm trying

426
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,519
to get like a I'm trying to get a uh a

427
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,918
consistent thing out here right so um

428
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,679
maybe we'll get back to them maybe we

429
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:45,720
won't okay so anyway garlic Bud Shiva

430
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:49,480
Shanti pretty impactful sold for a long

431
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,440
period of time um you know and the the

432
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,120
interesting thing about garlic bud is

433
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,038
that it doesn't see it seems like it was

434
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,798
always a seed line right yeah which

435
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,558
meant which was important because it

436
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,798
meant that it wasn't dependent on one

437
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:05,000
clone Staying Alive in order to make the

438
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:07,839
breeding right anytime you have a line

439
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,159
that relies on a single clone mother

440
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,798
father or whatever to make a breeding

441
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,080
it's delicate because that thing has to

442
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:16,558
stay alive anything that you get that's

443
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,558
an actual line it's a little easier to

444
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,519
keep it going because even if you lose

445
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,200
some of it if you have a bunch of seed

446
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,639
you can pop it and find stuff you want

447
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,120
and just make more of them yeah right

448
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,240
because you have a whole line okay um

449
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,639
and so

450
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,599
so I would say that the first two things

451
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,600
we mentioned um the the least you know

452
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,038
the least impact just in terms of how

453
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,000
often they were used garlic was used in

454
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:43,679
all kinds of stuff and Shiva Shanti was

455
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,159
used in all kinds of stuff so that was a

456
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,600
pretty huge impact and then the thing

457
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,720
that the thing that Jim Ortega gave to

458
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,319
Neville that probably had the most

459
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,558
impact was what crybaby already

460
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,960
mentioned uh this thing called Maple

461
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:00,839
Leaf

462
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:05,000
Indica okay um he gave Maple Leaf Indica

463
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:07,119
to Neville right and Neville popped it

464
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,839
sounds like he got a whole bunch of

465
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:15,319
seeds yeah because not only did Neville

466
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,558
pop the seeds and find various phenos

467
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:19,918
that became famous and ended up in all

468
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:22,000
kinds of different things but he had so

469
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,840
much seed he decided to sell that

470
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,880
Original Seed and he called it what did

471
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,480
he call it original Afghan mix or

472
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,480
something original Afghan mix 50 packs

473
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,599
yeah and he would sell literally he

474
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,200
would sell breeders packs in the 89 and

475
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,000
90

476
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,240
catalog of stuff that he got that was

477
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,640
just the same seeds that he pulled all

478
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:48,359
of his famous fenos out of right um and

479
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:53,720
and all that right and

480
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:58,678
uh um and so the reason why Maple Leaf

481
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:02,200
became so impactful okay is because he

482
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,600
had um this feno of maple leaf that he

483
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,159
called Afghan

484
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:09,599
te right that's right and he crossed

485
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:13,000
this to skunk and that became the basis

486
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:15,519
of Super Skunk right which is obviously

487
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,880
one of the most longtime extremely

488
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:21,079
famous lines that has ever existed right

489
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,840
it was also his best-selling line by

490
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:28,000
Miles he sold so much of that [ __ ]

491
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:30,199
line it it would probably be shocking to

492
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,159
think about you know that kind of speed

493
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,440
movement the [ __ ] he said he analyzed

494
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,000
his own sales and he analyzed um

495
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,880
sensey's sales and um you know it was

496
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,480
the bestselling line yeah right so he

497
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,840
basically took some stuff from Jim

498
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,038
Ortega and he crossed it to some stuff

499
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:49,798
from Sam and he ended up with this you

500
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:51,640
know he called it he put the skunk

501
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,440
because Sam had intentionally been

502
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,440
breeding the skunk out of

503
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,159
skunk he felt that by throwing this

504
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,720
skunk line back on the AF the Afghan he

505
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,000
brought out the original

506
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,120
skunk and I will go back a second

507
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,960
because you know one of the similarities

508
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,918
in all of this and one of the shared

509
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,840
like little commentaries is one of the

510
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,799
reasons that it seems although not

511
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:22,439
confirmed that garlic and maple might

512
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:25,319
actually be the same seedline not just

513
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,720
two different things is because that

514
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:32,000
commentary about being a skunk archetype

515
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,600
um was used about Afghan in particular

516
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
as well he said that you know what was

517
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,839
it like oh it was like you know the

518
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,720
archetype of Sam skunk

519
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:45,158
so oh yeah Afghan is the Bas of allies

520
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,519
but um yeah so before any further so

521
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,840
anyway this one's gonna take up a chunk

522
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,158
of time for a second because it goes

523
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,678
into all kinds of things

524
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,880
so Neville made some interesting

525
00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:02,440
observations right about how he thought

526
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:06,159
he understood the maple leaf line okay

527
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,000
but it kept throwing um different fenos

528
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,840
that would throw him off right so he

529
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,960
said when he first started popping Maple

530
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:18,398
Leaf he got these like very big bud

531
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,480
style chunky like bubblegum smelling uh

532
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:23,199
Afghan fenos right yeah and he thought

533
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,000
oh this this is kind of cool I

534
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,120
understand what's up and then he said

535
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,839
that he started popping some stuff and

536
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:35,879
he started getting these very hash plant

537
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:39,759
very frosty very dark hashy type plants

538
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,080
that he called Ortega right and then he

539
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,919
popped more and he found these sister

540
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:47,599
plants that he ended up calling Afghan

541
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,520
te and Afghan s right and he thought

542
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:53,199
these were more like skunk Arch types

543
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:56,200
right yeah bigger buds longer running

544
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,120
buds they were all in the same they were

545
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,840
all in the same line okay yeah um but he

546
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:06,158
found when he bred with them that they

547
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:08,119
tended to breed true to type yeah even

548
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,440
though all those types were within the

549
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:13,959
line itself you know he felt like the

550
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,759
bubblegum big bud ones tended to breed

551
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,360
more B big bud Bubblegum style plants

552
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:24,038
the hashy Ortega ones tended to breed

553
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:27,519
more hashy dark thick Afghan plants

554
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:29,079
right the Afghan s and Afghan T were two

555
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,599
of his favorite he used them in all

556
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:34,199
kinds of hybrids and he ended up making

557
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:38,158
a ton of stuff of which only a tiny

558
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,798
percentage got released yeah right and

559
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,799
so you know and there's a lot of stories

560
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:47,679
like he mentioned um you know uh Maple

561
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:50,158
Leaf uh Maple Leaf Wilson um there's a

562
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,640
lot of rumors about where this stuff

563
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,000
came from yeah you know uh that we could

564
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,000
talk about a little bit but the bottom

565
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,480
line is that they came from Jim Ortega

566
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,919
y Jim and Neville both agree that that's

567
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,038
where they came from right Y and Jim has

568
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,480
never

569
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,879
seen um worth it to him right for lack

570
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,839
of a better way to put it to come out

571
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,360
and lay out whether or not these things

572
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:18,839
he made whether these things he

573
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:22,759
collected who he got them from what

574
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:25,558
their parentage or lineage might be um

575
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:28,720
so all we have is Neville's

576
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:31,839
observations sure and

577
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,240
the way I is that Jim was a big

578
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:37,839
collector and had his people and the

579
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:42,720
things that he did make were things like

580
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:45,439
uh the queso Negra and stuff the cheese

581
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,558
Mexican or [ __ ] whatever it was but

582
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,600
you know early stuff and I think that

583
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:52,558
Neville's own words kind of you know

584
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,959
have that same implication you know

585
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,720
these things came from the collection of

586
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,200
someone else and this is someone who

587
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,480
isn't who you know we know that I got

588
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,240
them from

589
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,399
so but regardless of how they occurred

590
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,079
or anything else it just doesn't seem

591
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:12,319
like he has interest and what Jim has

592
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,319
seemed to be very interested one second

593
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,038
hi

594
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:18,519
Dwight oh I've been completely ignoring

595
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,278
uh the commentary because I haven't

596
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,960
wanted to throw off

597
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:26,519
anyone um but well done the only person

598
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,200
whose comments the only person whose

599
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:29,919
comments I've been putting on this

600
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,278
screen where Dwight's comments as you

601
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,038
were talking so anyway I'm not gonna I'm

602
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:38,558
not gonna out Dwight but um but if if

603
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:42,158
nine I DJ is Dwight um then he is one of

604
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:45,038
Neville very very old friends um and he

605
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,640
was around in the 80s and he was present

606
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:49,558
for a lot of this history that we're

607
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,600
speaking of um and he's also just a

608
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:56,319
really nice cool person so uh I feel

609
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:58,959
very happy that uh that he's in here um

610
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,439
and I like him quite a bit and uh I

611
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,880
really appre he's taken I've spent hours

612
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,120
chatting with him on various things uh

613
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,278
he's a straight OG uh he knows a lot of

614
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:11,518
the old history and um yeah so anyway

615
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:13,398
the reason I've been ignoring all the

616
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,480
comments is because it's it's gone off

617
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:19,119
into like Todd in NL land and I didn't

618
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,558
really want to get um uh completely

619
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:25,158
Sidra absolutely

620
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:28,200
sidetracked but I will say that Neville

621
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:30,320
loved the maple leaf okay and I feel

622
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,640
it's important I'll mention a few things

623
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:38,119
all right everybody got everybody got

624
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,320
obviously famous um you know from the

625
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:44,359
nl5 but when Neville made his first um

626
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,079
nl5 Haze crosses but when Neville

627
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:48,959
crossed the haze his two favorite

628
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:52,439
indicas at the moment were were the a

629
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,558
were the Afghan T and the NL and the nl5

630
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,919
feno that he had and so he made Haze by

631
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:01,158
Afghan te as well right

632
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,720
um I don't think he ever released it you

633
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:05,760
know but he had it and he called it I

634
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,159
even think he called it silver haze

635
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,960
right he did he called it silver ha

636
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,480
which is really confusing because then

637
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:16,440
later on uh released

638
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,720
the ceny released a silver haze that was

639
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,080
silver Pearl by Haze so it was very it

640
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:26,558
was very uh it was very different um but

641
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:28,558
Neville made a ton like a literal ton of

642
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:32,398
hybrids he had

643
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,678
I want to say three to five fenos of

644
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,038
maple leaf Indica pure Maple Leaf Indica

645
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,640
that he gave specific names to Afghan T

646
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:45,200
was one Afghan s was another he had one

647
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:48,278
that he called Ortega 15 okay um these

648
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,038
got used a lot um these got passed

649
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:54,960
around um the Ortega stuff went over to

650
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:58,200
Canada uh some of those seeds and and

651
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,000
they were released uh Louie Legends

652
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,000
indicia was based upon Neville's uh

653
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,960
Maple Leaf work um obviously the super

654
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,599
skunk has has been probably one of the

655
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,720
most things that was bred in by tons of

656
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:16,519
people into tons of work and Shanti

657
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,519
still uses a a Neville Super Skunk male

658
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:23,278
to this day so the the Afghan te uh

659
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,638
exists in a lot of different lines and

660
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,119
then I should say it's just it was

661
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:29,839
basically just like one of the biggest

662
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,558
Staples and whether it got name changed

663
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,558
or whether it got bred into different

664
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:39,720
things it became one of the big

665
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:42,278
backbones yeah canis I I mean kandle

666
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,120
kandle loved nordal too and that's the T

667
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:48,679
and the S smashed up with skunk one and

668
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:51,398
like those things hit there I I don't I

669
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,759
don't know if they thrived there but

670
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:55,239
they certainly [ __ ] hit there was

671
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,079
things that Neville made that he didn't

672
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,519
release that batches of seeds got out to

673
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,319
other folks in Canada and elsewhere and

674
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,759
then they ended up making lines and

675
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:08,398
releasing lines of things that Neville

676
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:11,038
had bothered to release right and so

677
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:13,879
there was um you know there was all

678
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,960
kinds of stuff going on so if you're

679
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,760
looking at impact um as crybaby

680
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,558
mentioned 10 minutes ago or something

681
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:24,919
like that Neville when Neville analyzed

682
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:27,319
sales both at his company and at Sensei

683
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:30,799
Super Skunk was probably the bestselling

684
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:33,720
line of the 90s yeah right so it it just

685
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:36,038
got blended into eenth million things

686
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,440
which meant that the maple leaf that Jim

687
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:42,440
Ortega had given to Neville ended up in

688
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,759
just all kinds of stuff renamed or

689
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,320
elsewise right yeah absolutely and still

690
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,359
percolates to this day right

691
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,319
so going back all right and this is

692
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,839
something that that Shanti just revealed

693
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:58,200
not that long ago in an interview with

694
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:02,199
his son but super skunk was something

695
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:06,440
that was bred by Neville but that Sensei

696
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,038
ended up trademarking the name okay so

697
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,880
when I went over to Amsterdam after

698
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:12,000
Neville had left Sensei uh and and was

699
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,080
working with

700
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,398
Greenhouse he would sell this stuff

701
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:19,519
called Ultra Ultra skunk yep that was

702
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:23,239
that was basically Super Skunk but it

703
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:27,798
couldn't have the name all right and

704
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:31,759
then later on Neville gave a super skunk

705
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:34,319
breeding mail to Shanti okay at Mr Nice

706
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,398
and Shanti couldn't call it super skunk

707
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,558
but if you look at his breeding and if

708
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:43,479
you see an Afghan skunk

709
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:46,599
male that's the super skunk male yeah

710
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,000
right so it literally is getting back to

711
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:52,798
the to the maple leaf maple leaf is

712
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,638
literally in in it's in so many things

713
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,480
yeah it's unbelievable one of the final

714
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:59,879
things one of the final things I should

715
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,558
say about Maple Leaf is that what's

716
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,000
interesting about Maple Leaf is that

717
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:05,839
when Neville when the company went from

718
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,599
Neville's own company to being owned by

719
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:13,319
the dronkers in sensei okay Maple Leaf

720
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,760
fell off the menu for about seven to

721
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,800
eight years I

722
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,520
think okay and then in the in the very

723
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,480
late 90s I don't know we were trying to

724
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,480
we were trying to figure out exactly

725
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,838
what year but we're just going to say

726
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:33,559
the very late 90s okay yeah sensey

727
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:36,960
re-released Maple Leaf Indica as a line

728
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:40,719
that they still sell right crybaby and I

729
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,918
were trying to figure out exactly we

730
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:46,678
don't know because ceni doesn't tell you

731
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:53,158
but Neville made a lot of hybrids that

732
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:55,398
were basically 75% Maple 25% skunk one

733
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:59,079
you know he took a lot of the fenos that

734
00:34:55,398 --> 00:35:01,960
he liked like Afghan s Afghan te Ortega

735
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:05,240
15 so and so mash them together use

736
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:08,480
skunk as a pollen donor um for some of

737
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:12,919
those ones and so it's entirely possible

738
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:16,320
although we're not sure that the um that

739
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:20,159
ceny revive the maple leaf indicial line

740
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:24,480
yeah from those

741
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:27,960
mostly Maple Leaf but slightly skunk

742
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,679
hybrids that Neville seems most likely

743
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,119
it it's what seems most likely we don't

744
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,000
know for sure but we do know for sure

745
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,640
that after seven or eight years of being

746
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,039
off the menu it rep popped up on the

747
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,920
menu and most of the maple leaf

748
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,079
including the stuff that crybaby and I

749
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,358
and our friend rings and stuff like that

750
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:49,720
has been percolating around is from that

751
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:56,400
late is is from that late 90s very early

752
00:35:49,719 --> 00:36:00,118
2000s Sensei releases yeah you know um

753
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,160
and uh you know know and you know so it

754
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:06,119
it exists it percolates around out there

755
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:08,078
um that plant those that seed line that

756
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,640
that Jim Ortega gave to Neville Neville

757
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,039
loved and he crossed it with basically

758
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:15,440
everything good that he had he released

759
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,838
some lines officially under his own

760
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,559
brand Sensei released some other stuff

761
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,960
it was mixed into all kinds of stuff

762
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,159
there was a version of black domino that

763
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,880
had the garlic bud in there uh there was

764
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,358
a version of black domino that had the

765
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,640
Afghan s in there I believe

766
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:36,000
um right there was a lot of there was a

767
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:39,639
lot of different things um released you

768
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
know uh Shanti because Shanti bought a

769
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:44,519
chunk of Neville's collection both uh I

770
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,400
believe clones and seeds um there's

771
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,480
probably a lot of that percolating

772
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,200
around through shanti's work because it

773
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,639
seems like that super skunk male is one

774
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:57,078
of the cornerstones of his breeding yeah

775
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:59,799
which means that it exists in all kinds

776
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:03,318
of forms throughout different uh

777
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,200
different things right and so it's sort

778
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:07,679
of one of the big it became one of the

779
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,719
big backbones of cannabis because

780
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,279
Neville liked it so much crossed it with

781
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,639
so many different things and then it

782
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,599
popped up and percolated in different

783
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:18,078
companies in Canada different companies

784
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,039
in Switzerland different Holland

785
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:25,440
companies and it just I think it's

786
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:28,239
impact you know um despite being like

787
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,480
here's the funny thing right is that Jim

788
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,639
Ortega has decided not to tell us very

789
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,039
much more than we already know about

790
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:39,400
this line right but the reality is is

791
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,599
that Neville liked it enough and other

792
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,880
people have liked it enough to keep

793
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,160
working with it like to me that's the

794
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,358
greatest compliment you can give

795
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:50,239
cannabis is when people like it enough

796
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,519
to work with it and then over years

797
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,959
people still want it to keep finding it

798
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:56,318
to keep working with it because they

799
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,440
like it so much well think about this

800
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:00,440
way one of I I mean what would

801
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,280
conventionally be seen you know in a

802
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,599
commer sense as one of Neville's

803
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,119
greatest rivals in the early era when

804
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,160
they had the opportunity to get that

805
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:14,640
number three Orga seed line they made a

806
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,920
whole [ __ ] deal out of it Hank made

807
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,039
it the biggest [ __ ] deal when Dutch

808
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,680
Passion released that Ortega number

809
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:24,159
three and it was in these special boxes

810
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,879
and it was a [ __ ] Legacy pack and

811
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,039
that was someone who did actually have

812
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,640
weed that was unique from neb earlier

813
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,440
cuz he was the big hash Smuggler way

814
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:36,799
back and all that [ __ ] like he had Dutch

815
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:39,280
[ __ ] that wasn't Sam that wasn't Nev and

816
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,920
even when a decade later he had the

817
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,960
opportunity to pounce on that he was

818
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,880
like this [ __ ] I'm gonna I'm [ __ ] I'm

819
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,838
getting this [ __ ] I'm releasing it and

820
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,800
and that's and that's a great example

821
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:56,000
when when the impact of your work

822
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,839
actually makes your [ __ ] competition

823
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,880
consider that they need a pie pie of

824
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:03,759
that too they need to do something with

825
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:06,119
that too so the cool part is that a seed

826
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,839
deal that Neville made in the late in

827
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:12,760
the mid to late 80s okay still

828
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:17,239
dramatically impacts the Cannabis scene

829
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:20,400
today yeah absolutely it does you know

830
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:21,879
um you know and and uh a lot of you know

831
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,559
a lot of the

832
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,519
uh you know honestly to to switch back

833
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,799
too like when gab I don't know if gab's

834
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,358
still in here but when Gabby and I were

835
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,560
doing a bunch of that super dog work

836
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:38,318
right that had super skunk from Neville

837
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:40,039
in it yeah you know so it like it I mean

838
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:44,159
whether or not people get credited or

839
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:46,559
not um you know Jim giving that to Jim

840
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:50,279
giving that to Neville and then Neville

841
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:52,119
popularizing it uh we keep using it you

842
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,880
know so people were using it in the 80s

843
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:55,800
people were using it in the 90s Gabby

844
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,000
and I were using it in our own way in

845
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,280
California it gets used used and used

846
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,239
and used you know all these different

847
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:08,760
things and it just has ended up being a

848
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:10,159
combination of um you know a jeel um you

849
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,240
know there's all kinds of different

850
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,399
things that it keeps popping up in it

851
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:17,919
really

852
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,358
is um one of the biggest backbones in

853
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,119
cannabis well you know and this kind of

854
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:27,480
goes back to you know where we started

855
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:30,280
hours ago you know what does it mean to

856
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,719
cannabis if you started with what's

857
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,400
essentially very close to primordial

858
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,480
material in the Cannabis world you know

859
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,318
did your work with it and managed to

860
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,760
reface the whole [ __ ] game the whole

861
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:48,358
industry the nature of what people

862
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:52,800
wanted for an indefinite future is I

863
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:54,920
mean how how can you breed any further

864
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,880
than that really the funny part about

865
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,599
this is you know we were trying to uh we

866
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,519
were trying to uh keep these shows to

867
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,760
two hours or something I

868
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:07,960
thought I thought that when we when we

869
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,839
started this this chat about uh uh this

870
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,318
week's history lesson that we would be

871
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:15,239
able to bring it in a little shorter

872
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:19,559
than that but it just goes to show um

873
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:21,639
how wide ranging uh that trade or that

874
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:25,000
that deal that Neville made with with

875
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:27,279
Jim did and how um you know and how

876
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,318
impactful it was and how impactful it

877
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,040
continues to be um you know and so I

878
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:36,199
think like a lot of the original Afghan

879
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:38,400
a you know Afghan mix parents are dead

880
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:42,759
but it's children and grandchildren and

881
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:46,480
stuff like that uh like really really

882
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,359
continue to impact sure and you know we

883
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,960
can't do genetic testing and stuff like

884
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:55,598
that right now but um you know it it's

885
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,639
in so many different things because it

886
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,800
tasted good and it smelled good good and

887
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:04,400
it made nice bud structure and all that

888
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,079
and if you look at it that Afghan skunk

889
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,599
if you look if you go on Mr Nice you

890
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,880
know seed bank or something and you look

891
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,400
for things that a Afghan skunk that

892
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,079
breeding mail that Neville gave him is

893
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,838
one of the four or five backbone

894
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,760
breeding males that is still in all of

895
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,838
his stuff yeah and it's been used and

896
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,319
used and used over and over and over

897
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:26,920
again it has used to

898
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,639
death yeah because it's just good it's

899
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,079
just good and it's been used by

900
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:31,480
different companies in different ways

901
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,359
and different companies have taken

902
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,440
different permutations of some of these

903
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,159
things and gone in their own directions

904
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,800
with it uh I mean I I wish today I could

905
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,440
still get Louie you know Legends

906
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,559
ultimate indicia it would be it would be

907
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,720
pretty neat you know and uh and those

908
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,800
guys in Canada and Blockhead and some of

909
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,519
that different stuff that they were

910
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:54,519
making with it and that was just random

911
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:58,000
seeds that they got right so um Black

912
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:59,199
Domina uh was out of seeds that I

913
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,760
personally

914
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:06,118
bought um that was the coolest thing

915
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,680
that I found you know and um you know

916
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,400
speaking of speaking of Gabby uh Gabby's

917
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:13,558
buddy gave us a Black Domina that I was

918
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,318
tasted like pepper and I wish I still

919
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:18,079
had it was phenomenal Yeah you mentioned

920
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,759
that to me before yeah it was really

921
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,920
good man I I still regret losing that

922
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,680
one um but it it it was really I mean so

923
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,240
I think what happened is is that's a

924
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:30,078
story for a different time because we

925
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:34,159
can get on we can get on tangents we'll

926
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:37,000
save that one but in in in closing on

927
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:39,159
this week's history a mysterious guy

928
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,880
from America that chose the moniker Jim

929
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:43,838
Ortega did some trades with Neville gave

930
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,880
Neville a bunch of stuff the stuff ended

931
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:48,199
up being fire he ended up using it in

932
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,440
all kinds of different things and it

933
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:52,799
keeps taking on a life of its own and

934
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:57,440
popping up in different breeders work

935
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,670
still today rundown was immaculate

936
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:08,699
