1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,539
how's it going future cannabis project

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,280
Community Lobster fam Farms here today

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,258
I'd like to go through some of my most

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,739
recent techniques and methods to be

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,920
viroid safe while taking cuttings

6
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,959
so I like to start by bleaching any and

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,100
all tools I will be using to take

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,880
cuttings that includes the scissors the

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,618
bottom trays the top domes and even the

10
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,539
little plastic containers that I'm going

11
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:34,920
to be using to put the cubes in and the

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,960
rooting solution

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,320
and anything you use you want to bleach

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,320
thoroughly

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,859
we've had these scissors soaking in the

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,859
bleach for about 20 minutes

17
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,859
so I've got all my equipment and tools

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,140
bleached I've taken a shower and changed

19
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,239
my clothes so I can be as clean as I can

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,680
now it's time to set up for taking

21
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,259
cuttings

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,900
so I've got some rock wool cubes today

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm going to be handling everything with

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,359
plants or with plant fluid with my left

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
hand which is going to be gloved at all

26
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,879
times with a different glove for each

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,879
plant

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,159
so I've got mine for for

29
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:38,900
rooting mixture water ready

30
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,900
and start soaking some cubes

31
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,740
while those are soaking

32
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm going to place in each plastic cup

33
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:58,019
this isn't something I've ever done

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,478
before taking cuttings but thinking

35
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:03,000
about it long and hard it seems like

36
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,859
this is another way that the fluids can

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,618
pass through each other so if you're not

38
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,598
doing one genetic from one plant and a

39
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,759
whole tray this is my preferred

40
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,359
technique where I've bleach these little

41
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,359
cups

42
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,340
do probably

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,920
maybe nine per tray maybe only six or

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,239
eight but what I'm trying to accomplish

45
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,919
here is making it so that the root base

46
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,599
and the fluids passing through will

47
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,818
never touch each other and I'm going to

48
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:34,500
try to give them each enough space so

49
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,539
that the plants themselves don't touch

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,318
each other if they were from a different

51
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:39,318
mother plant

52
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,359
cubes are soaked up

53
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,939
with the glove hands

54
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,359
I'm gonna plop one in each

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,080
and then after we get those all set up

56
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,419
Next Step begins

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,560
so I'm making my labels for the plants

58
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,719
that I'm going to be taking cuttings

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,400
from and even this process I'm going to

60
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,259
hold them all with my left hand with a

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,760
fresh glove and use the marker with the

62
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,979
right hand just because these are going

63
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,419
to be jammed down in the soil I do not

64
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,340
know how long the fluid would just live

65
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:23,958
on a piece of plastic and fresh air but

66
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,959
one more thing to keep in mind

67
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,158
so I've got my area staged I've got all

68
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,199
my scissors bleached and cleaned I have

69
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,598
as many gloves as I can fit on my paw

70
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,818
comfortably I can usually fit about nine

71
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,939
or ten before I start losing dexterity

72
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:41,098
and circulation I have about 18

73
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:44,158
different plants to take cuttings from

74
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:46,139
today so two rounds of nine gloves will

75
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,239
do just fine

76
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,119
last thing I'm doing

77
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,158
is putting rooting solution in each of

78
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,658
their own individual cups for the 18

79
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,378
plants

80
00:03:54,658 --> 00:04:00,239
I like to use plastic Dixies and bleach

81
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,098
them but sometimes these little wax

82
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,378
paper ones are good in a pinch they're

83
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,658
quick they're cheap and it doesn't

84
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:09,500
really like leave too much of the carbon

85
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:09,500
footprint so

86
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,900
I've got my rooting solution ready one

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,298
for each plant

88
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,358
so what I'm running through today I have

89
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,418
eight Harlem River hazes from pifcoast

90
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:27,599
genetics and I generally like the

91
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,939
morphology so far they got humongous

92
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,100
leaves some of them are narrow some of

93
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:34,759
them are a little broader but I like the

94
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,759
way they're drawn

95
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,399
next I have some sister nice

96
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,978
that is a Oregon Afghani crossed with a

97
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,739
G13 old school G13 these ones are from

98
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:51,478
Professor p and Relic seeds and I'm

99
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,060
really digging these ones they got the

100
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:57,478
super leathery looking leaves dark dark

101
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,639
green now this one right here has a

102
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,319
serious issue that doesn't seem to be

103
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,000
showing itself anywhere else in the

104
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,800
garden so it's got to be a mutation or

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,120
something genetic anyone out in the

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,520
community who can give me a little

107
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,759
Clarity on this it seems like it's

108
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:15,240
directly one half of this Leaf directly

109
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,919
these two halves of these Leaf blades I

110
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,600
don't want to go Bro Science and try to

111
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,459
diagnose it if anyone out there knows

112
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,180
better than me let me know

113
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:26,819
I have four of those then I have these

114
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,240
two that I'm very excited about these

115
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,978
are Oregon Afghani cross with uh the

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,379
cheese male the cheese back cross mail

117
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:37,038
that Professor P messes with these ones

118
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:40,740
again have super super dark green

119
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,240
leathery leaves squat growth and I'm

120
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,100
really really stoked to see what comes

121
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,019
out of these I only have a couple so

122
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,520
it's kind of a gamble but we'll see it's

123
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,459
always fun

124
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,879
speaking of gambles I have three of the

125
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,739
Holy Communion crossed to a Wilson by a

126
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,600
mortal Hatchery although I don't think

127
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,579
he would call himself a breeder but he

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,379
made some seeds they found their way

129
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:04,800
into my hand and they got wet the next

130
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,939
day so I have four of them this one I

131
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
don't think I'm going to take a cutting

132
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:08,939
off of I just don't like the growth of

133
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,939
it

134
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,259
just I just don't dig it so I got these

135
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:17,339
three that I'm going to take cuttings

136
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:19,199
off of this one's super super lanky

137
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,519
this one's got some broader darker

138
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,620
leaves

139
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,418
a little more closer structure but the

140
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,978
branches aren't going out so much this

141
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:28,680
one I kind of like so far I'm hoping

142
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:32,180
this one's a tasty female

143
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,180
that's what's on the table today

144
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,279
so I think I'm just gonna do six plants

145
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,899
per tray on this one I have this hand is

146
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,638
going to be my scissor hand every time

147
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,399
that's not going to touch a plant and

148
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,720
it's going to go from this scissor is

149
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,120
going to be put down I'm going to grab a

150
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,800
fresh one every time I'm going to try to

151
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,660
not get plant fluid on this hand

152
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,939
regardless even though ideally it's not

153
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,919
touching another plant each time I go

154
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:59,160
through a plant I rip off a pair of

155
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:03,060
gloves and then that is for the next

156
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,919
Plant I have the little cup of rooting

157
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,060
solution that will be just for this

158
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,818
plant

159
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,459
ready to rock and roll now as I've

160
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:16,800
already gone over in a previous short I

161
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,799
did I like to get at least two

162
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:26,339
cuttings when I'm first starting so that

163
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:28,139
I can flour one and keep one as a backup

164
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:32,219
so I'm going to try to get at least two

165
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:36,259
off of each plant this first one is the

166
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,259
Holy Communion crossed into the Wilson

167
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,620
and I'll tell you what that sucker looks

168
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,819
covered in grease already

169
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,978
whoa doggy

170
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,979
okay that's fun that's fun

171
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:04,219
and now this plan is going to rest on

172
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,220
the cup that's going into

173
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,780
this plant smells good man I love this

174
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:14,779
left

175
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
so we have two

176
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,500
of the Holy Communion Wilson number one

177
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,280
is ready to go this set of scissors

178
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,079
going down after I plug those this pair

179
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,458
of gloves coming off actually these

180
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,500
scissors aren't going down yet this is

181
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,598
something I wanted to touch on now I've

182
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,879
been being hyper cautious with this

183
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,500
round of seedlings I haven't even pruned

184
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,838
the cotyledons are like the little

185
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,519
jammies off yet so since I have a pair

186
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,640
of gloves and scissors that correlate

187
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:51,659
with this plant this is a perfect time

188
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:53,580
to get in there and prune

189
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:56,879
and typically I would have already

190
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,080
pruned all this stuff off but again just

191
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,259
trying to be

192
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,440
hyper cautious this round

193
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:07,919
against this viroid but this is a plant

194
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,620
shape that I much prefer

195
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,120
especially when doing a hunt

196
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,200
because that doesn't take up as much

197
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,080
room

198
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,820
it's not going to transpire as much

199
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,778
maintain it pretty much just get cuts

200
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,700
off of it

201
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:22,320
and another thing to consider that I

202
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,519
just thought of since I'm doing so many

203
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,220
less

204
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,500
plants than typical on a tray like this

205
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,360
the little micro climate in there is

206
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,159
going to be something to consider now

207
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,919
I'm going to take some bigger cuts to

208
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,719
try to fill that area out but whatever

209
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,159
your Technique is going to be if it gets

210
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,480
too dry in there obviously the Coatings

211
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,360
aren't going to be happy so if you're

212
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,000
ever going to do this few Cuts per tray

213
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,200
most people do 50 20 at least

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,879
you're gonna have to keep that in

215
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,980
consideration the microclimate is going

216
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,980
to be a little different so these are

217
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,259
soaked for a solid 10 seconds or so

218
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,259
I'm going to use the sand glove

219
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:12,500
I think that sucker right now

220
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,500
use this same glove

221
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,879
I don't see how this could be a male

222
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,860
this thing reeks

223
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,778
and so now those two plants are going to

224
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,220
take up that little area

225
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:26,278
these ones are going to get their own

226
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,220
area even though they're sisters

227
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,039
and pro they came from the same you know

228
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,259
flower

229
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,740
just in case

230
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:40,139
they're all going to get their own space

231
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,440
I haven't heard conclusively from anyone

232
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:46,019
yet if there is a 10 pass of the viroid

233
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,820
through seeds doesn't seem like it's

234
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:51,360
really proven yet so I'm going to assume

235
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,980
yes and that if I have 18 cuttings in

236
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,039
here most likely two of them are coming

237
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,720
equipped with the Violet so why not just

238
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,740
keep them all separate and keep them

239
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,019
safe

240
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,459
from there it's a good way to start

241
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,120
things at least

242
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:08,399
so this plant's prunes

243
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,919
his glove off

244
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,919
onto the next one wash rinse repeat

245
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,120
some final thoughts on hot plate and

246
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,338
prevention

247
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,078
when taken cutting so it's not just when

248
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,200
taking Coatings it's all throughout the

249
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,479
entire gardening process even late stage

250
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,759
transmission can lead to some funky

251
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,759
flowers so I've been trying to train

252
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,578
myself to be super diligent one thing I

253
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:38,399
like about the garden beds is that if

254
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:40,739
you do the same genetic ideally from the

255
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,379
same mother plant let's assume the

256
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,320
plants are clean to start then you can

257
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:47,700
only have to use one set of scissors per

258
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
day

259
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,100
on you know or one one pair of scissors

260
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,778
per bed which is ideal to me that like

261
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,399
I'm like not stripping gloves off all

262
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:57,838
the time and just being able to go at it

263
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,120
and not have to worry about all the

264
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,940
little hiccups in between that really

265
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,200
helps me a lot

266
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,440
um

267
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,300
some questions I have for the community

268
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,640
if anyone else knows like I'd love to

269
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,379
know some things how long does this how

270
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,139
long can the viroids survive on

271
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:18,899
fingertips like let's assume I had dirty

272
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,939
practices pinching some leaves off of

273
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,399
some Infected plants how long can it

274
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,680
live in that fluid on my fingertips

275
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,500
how long can it live on the plant fluid

276
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,899
on the scissors let's say I missed

277
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,120
something and shared scissors with a

278
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,039
plants that I shouldn't have but it was

279
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,259
like you know let's say in theory 10

280
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,879
days apart can that fluid still be

281
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,179
living on those scissors what's the

282
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,120
expiration date and how that can

283
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,578
correlate too it's like let's say I I

284
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,980
pruned an infected plant two days ago I

285
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:51,599
got plant fluid on my hand that was the

286
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,000
last thing I did now I'm going to a

287
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,980
clean Garden is like my watering

288
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,659
practices and me touching the bucket and

289
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,579
like my hand even touching the water

290
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,759
that's the mixture is that a possible

291
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,319
transmission I don't think so but like I

292
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,539
want these things to be clearly laid out

293
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,980
that's for sure one thing I would love

294
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:14,099
too is to see clear concise conclusive

295
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,220
evidence if the viroad is being passed

296
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,740
by pests or not I feel like then all of

297
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,660
these techniques are for not if it's

298
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,180
just going to be as simple as uh having

299
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,399
a bug come in bite won't plant and bite

300
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,620
another I've heard very conflicting

301
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,259
views on this subject I'd love to raise

302
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,560
the conversation more I'm not educated

303
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:38,278
enough and you know entomology or plant

304
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,379
biology to speculate but I'm assuming it

305
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:45,059
can you know but I want to know how long

306
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:47,458
can that plant fluid survive on a pests

307
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:49,919
you know anthers or you know wherever

308
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:52,259
this fluid is smothered in its face so

309
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,958
I'd love to keep this conversation going

310
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,419
I love to hear other people's approaches

311
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,458
and techniques if anyone sees any Folly

312
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,179
in my Approach I'd love to hear that as

313
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,879
well

314
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:06,019
and uh nothing but respect and most love

315
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,019
to the Cannabis community

316
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,778
peace out
