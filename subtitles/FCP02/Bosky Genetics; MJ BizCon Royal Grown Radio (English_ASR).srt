53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,079
comes in at and uh we're excited to find

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,920
out what the strain is i remember going

55
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,279
and visiting you last year's competition

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,478
right yeah and you guys were ahead of

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,519
the game you had already harvested

58
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,438
smart even

59
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,118
with that one man we uh we jumped the

60
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,560
gun you know on getting it out there

61
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,000
before the competition was over and

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,080
there was you know

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,560
but it was fun we made a little uh you

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,400
know jar that had let our

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,920
customers you know chime in and guess

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,879
what the stream was too so yeah but he

67
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,799
was stoked to uh participate so one of

68
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,639
the coolest things about the grow-off is

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
this mystery genetics and getting a

70
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,399
genetic that's kind of new to market

71
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,639
that hasn't really blown up yet you know

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
getting access to that cut

73
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,318
i just love

74
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,959
a lot about the grow-off competition the

75
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,759
data analytics the kind of

76
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,640
actual scientific data but really for me

77
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,560
the coolest thing is like what stream is

78
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,159
this yeah i don't know i'm curious this

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,080
is the first that i've actually seen

80
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,239
finished flower we were talking trees

81
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,200
farms and seeing the plants live on the

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
vine

83
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,439
and the smell yeah was like

84
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,280
sweet papaya punchy

85
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:03,039
yeah but it had a little bit of like

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,039
dirty acrid putri

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
but it's crazy to see all the different

88
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,359
growers you know too i mean both indoor

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,040
outdoor you know the techniques the

90
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,959
nutrients that everybody use you know

91
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,560
lighting i mean everything affects the

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,680
way that this flower turns out you know

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,000
so it's

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,080
it's neat man i will say as as you know

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,759
a company that we sponsor him every year

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
what are we on four or five years now

97
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,120
yeah at least and for many of those

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,719
years i've had the the honor and

99
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
privilege to go to a ton of these

100
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,039
contestants farms and facilities and see

101
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,878
them yeah and it is really fascinating

102
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,239
to see the differences on how they're

103
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:41,598
being cultivated

104
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,878
you know sometimes really different

105
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,079
sometimes you get there and i'm like wow

106
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,318
this looks like a completely different

107
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
strain in some ways i agree i agree

108
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,399
everybody has their own method this

109
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,840
tweet everybody has their own way it's

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,039
you know it's your way is the best i

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,560
mean there's a lot of input from the

112
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,798
industry and a lot of nutrients that we

113
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,640
can use and a lot of lighting we can use

114
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,319
but what ultimately it comes down to is

115
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,598
being comfortable with what you're doing

116
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,878
and loving what you're doing and being

117
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,238
happy when you're done you know that's a

118
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,679
true success you know

119
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,039
definitely people in it for the business

120
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,959
and for the financials of it and the

121
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,239
game that they believe is there but you

122
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,519
know people that are true to that i

123
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,280
think are going to be more successful

124
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,360
because this makes me feel like i'm a

125
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
kid again man like the excitement is

126
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,799
like opening up presents on christmas

127
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,478
you know so it's that's

128
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,638
that's the joy for me i like i like

129
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,159
growing cannabis you know so every

130
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,519
strain is is

131
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,120
important you know

132
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,799
so what sort of strains are you working

133
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,879
on you guys are obviously breeding doing

134
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,960
all sorts of genetic experimentation

135
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,639
like what is it that's popping out to

136
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,039
you right now what's the avenue that you

137
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,840
want to see genetics steer towards i

138
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,080
love gas i love ogs i mean that's i love

139
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,159
that dominant you know force in the in

140
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,680
the strain you know so for me i mean

141
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,759
most of the stuff that i've i've played

142
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,478
with in the past is all og dominant you

143
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,960
know

144
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,918

145
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,638
the uh

146
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,639

147
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,040
ocido and that there's heavy og

148
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,639
influence on that too so uh the phenos

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
we're finding i mean i'm finding a lot

150

little bit you know

154
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,959
yeah it's amazing and like we were kind

155
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,879
of going through a few of these phenoms

156
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,120
earlier at the booth you were showing us

157
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,079

158
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,319
i just love getting into that like fino

159
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,478
hunt type of mindset and you're like oh

160
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,120

og cut through it's winning the battle

164
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,599
here and then you had what was it the

165
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,519
five i think you said yeah the number

166
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,199
five is my favorite that's that to me is

167
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,560
the powerhouse it it'll stop you

168
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,879
mid-joint you know and make you think

169
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,879
about it

170
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
like when we were smelling it on the

171
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,639
floor i'm like i can't pinpoint it like

172
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,879
this emoji

173
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,680
no yes and there's some sweeter notes

174
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,759
but it's really unique

175
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
i love it man i mean i i still have

176
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,120
crosses with the old train wreck you

177
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,279
know i got train wreck for brian you

178
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
know yeah matches so that that got

179
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,679
incorporated into some of the the lines

180
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,080
and and so i mean we found some crazy uh

181
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,800
phoenix

182
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,800
is a staple of my youth in cannabis one

183
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,400
of my my long time i've held that strain

184
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,919
longer than any strain i've had

185
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,399
throughout the years i mean i held it

186
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,918
for over 15 years i think you know i see

187
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,279
it occasionally in outdoor farms up in

188
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,719
humboldt you know i think last year i

189
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,000
went to two different farms up in alder

190
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,520
point yeah and they were running some

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,839
train wreck and it is something that

192
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,079
happens when you're about 25 feet away

193
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,719
from that road that you're like oh damn

194
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,038
i just got like the whole deja vu

195
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,560
man it's it's still one of the all-time

196
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,959
favorites i agree

197
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,959
yeah it's one of my favorite profiles

198
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,719
also one of my favorite smokers yeah i

199
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,918
like the way it is exactly

200
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,400
the feel

201
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,399
it's clear i love the train ride yeah we

202
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,239
think you see it brought back into a lot

203
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,000
of breeding programs in the near future

204
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,680
there's already some companies that are

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,439
using it and working with it because it

206
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
has a lot of traits that benefit you

207
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,719
know different kinds of strains you can

208
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,879
mix with this so you we think you'll see

209
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,560
in the future train wrecks like to come

210
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,759
into breeding programs and start coming

211
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,598
back around

212
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,199
it is pure you know it doesn't have a

213
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,519
lot of influence from the the newer

214
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,680
genetics so it's nice to mix the old the

215
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,598
new and you know have that ability to do

216
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,918
that man i love that you mentioned that

217
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,240
new school genetics i talked with my my

218
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,240
old man about this and yeah he's back in

219
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,918
michigan does this little tiny medical

220
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,199
thing and you know got old school

221
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,519
strands and i'm like

222
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,199
check out the new school genetics

223
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,079
there's a difference here it's not just

224
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,560
like a new strain yeah it's a new type

225
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,198
of genetic profile we weren't seeing

226
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,598
these cookies gelato type

227
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,680
nuggets the bud structure the way that

228
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,759
they grow i mean it's yeah everything

229
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
out there that i'm seeing i mean hats

230
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,560
off to all the breeders that are doing

231
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,839
it you know i mean it's a lot of work

232
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
you know the guys that are really like

233
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,598
like humble seed company for instance

234
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,280
those guys put a lot of love into this

235
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,279
plant you know and and the amount of

236
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,878
seeds that they're planting and the

237
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,559
farms that they're working with and and

238
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,120
you know building in that network you

239
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,519
know is amazing we had the monroe grown

240
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,038
radio uh the beginning of season two i

241
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,639
believe yeah yeah and we were talking

242
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,959
about some of those female hunts ten

243
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
twenty thousand plant you know hunts um

244
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,839
you know nat obviously he's been in the

245
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,918
game and doing this for a while super

246
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,519
passionate and then his daughter ali is

247
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,519
just you know she's amazing amazing just

248
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,198
super brilliant yeah and uh and just

249
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,598
right there in her dad's daddy's doing

250
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,680
god's work man i mean

251
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,759
it's amazing to see it well that's one

252
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,680
similarity i see is the passion like

253
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,160
that's what really spoke to me about

254
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,160
what nat and hallie do is that they mean

255
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,680
it with every fiber of their being and

256
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,959
that's one thing i've seen from you guys

257
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,440
from the get-go too is like

258
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,199
you want to blow people's minds and you

259
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,760
want to make yourselves proud of what

260
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,919
you do and that's what separates any

261
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,278
truly successful business

262
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,799
or process

263
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,159
yeah we put the plant first i mean

264
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,599
that's that's the

265
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,759
that's what's carried us through the

266
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,680
last you know 20 plus years of our life

267
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,519
you know so i mean that if we take the

268
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,879
focus away from that then nothing

269
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,080
nothing works out you know if you're

270
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,919
looking at the other side of it the

271
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,360
money and and all of that you know

272
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,039
that's that's the wrong thing to look at

273
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,120
you know something that we talk about

274
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,399
quite a bit on this on this program is

275
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,399
that uh you know the hustle with

276
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,159
integrity yeah you know coined by fat

277
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,759
bold clothing you know good big shout

278
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,519
out to brian swizzler for that one man

279
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,559
but we can't stop saying that and

280
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,159
bringing that back up in the

281
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,599
conversations because

282
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,039
that is something that attracts all of

283
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,519
us man that hustle with integrity you

284
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,559
keep keeping your good intentions

285
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,320
you know when we're driving the

286
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,039
direction of this plan you know going

287
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,399
forward and being able to dodge the uh

288
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,079
the ill intentions you know because

289
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,080
there's a lot of them always is going to

290
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,839
yeah no doubt i think you focus on

291
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,959
trying to be great at your craft no

292
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,480
matter what your craft is whether it's

293
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,399
cannabis painting

294
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,759
your you know music or whatever it is if

295
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,879
you're trying to truly be great at your

296
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,799
craft that attracts people which which

297
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,639
in turn will attract the financial that

298
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,799
people are looking for that comes with

299
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,000
that but you should focus focus on

300
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,919
that's what you're trying to do and

301
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,679
accomplish and be better at it and make

302
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,360
that better and truly enjoy what you're

303
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,559
doing you know and all that will come

304
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
later you know a lot of people are

305
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,679
successful you know chasing the dollar

306
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,519
in a sense you know what i mean they

307
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,559
figure out their path or their brand or

308
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
whatever they do that makes them

309
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,078
successful makes them money and that's

310
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,879
their place that's okay you know but

311
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,399
just for us we just try to focus on on

312
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,639
you know perfecting our craft and

313
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,679
staying genuine as cultivators and

314
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,159
trying to really you know dial in

315
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,000
staying true to a legacy grower but

316
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,399
bringing science into it and being able

317
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,159
to bridge the gap between both and be

318
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,078
able to communicate in both worlds you

319
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,919
know and and be successful with that

320
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,519
we're not trying to do a large grow

321
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,199
we're trying to blow things up you know

322
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,679
we're trying to be a small you know

323
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,920
boutique things it's amazing to have the

324
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,519
access that we have now to technology

325
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,759
and what we can actually bring into the

326
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,200
equation you know to uh assist with the

327
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,958
growth you know whereas yeah it's got a

328
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,879
lot more data today you know it was it

329
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,479
was difficult to do that so the other

330
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,399
day that was great data driven was

331
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
hanging out at the local hydro store and

332
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,399
yeah and the owners bring it for an hour

333
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,720
when there was no searching

334
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,879
comparing forums you know like that

335
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,720
stories from family members or

336
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,039
especially multiple generation growers

337
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,879
that you know uncles are our parents

338
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,039
that have grown in their life and passed

339
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,278
on stories that we've sat around as kids

340
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,199
listening to you know as they smoked or

341
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,639
you know told us about the plan or

342
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,560
different methods that i still believe

343
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,078
in as in like the old

344
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,518
hippie style method compared to a

345
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,439
scientific method because i think you

346
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,839
got to stay genuine to the passion and

347
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,839
the love to really understand you know

348
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,120
where this originated at and started and

349
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,200
got to this point you know what i mean

350
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,879
so yeah a lot of old stories from family

351
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,879
members and you know they could use

352
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,879
to be able to put a number to you know

353
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,000
what we've seen for all these years you

354
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,000
know and that's that's really the

355
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,919
awesome part of it is correlate the

356
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,839
numbers with you know the results well

357
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,240
that passion fuels the request for data

358
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,839
so you like you're like this is better

359
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,519
yes what did we do differently exactly

360
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
let's get a soil sample let's send it to

361
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,278
the lab let's check tissue samples every

362
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,200
week you know it's tissues every week

363
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,958
we'd send nutrient samples every week i

364
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,639
mean wow that was kind of our routine we

365
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,719
ran well water with the last grow we

366
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,399
were at so we had a moving target we

367
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,079
were always chasing you know what was

368
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,320
going on with the the chemistry in the

369
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,078
ground you know so it was uh it was fun

370
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,519
it was a major learning experience you

371
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,599
know it definitely uh

372
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,120
brought out the best in us

373
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,399
yeah yeah you know it makes you better

374
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,919
and if you approach it in a positive

375
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,919
sense that trying to better and learn

376
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,958
and accomplish and beat that then it

377
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,159
just makes you better at what you're

378
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,518
trying to do you know what i mean before

379
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,360
you know it especially growing your

380
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,120
whole life that's the goal is eliminate

381
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
variables you know and make it as easy

382
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,839
as possible so you can be happy and

383
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,600
successful at the end if you fought it

384
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,279
the whole time it's you're stressed out

385
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,120
you burn out you're tired you question

386
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,439
what you did and so it's eliminate those

387
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,360
variables you know and learn you know

388
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,360
what to do so that you don't have those

389
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,399
issues and in the beginning and prepare

390
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
you know so that you don't have those

391
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,759
issues and then after that especially

392
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,600
the right environment and the dialogue

393
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,120
environment really gives different

394
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,759
strains you know the opportunity to

395
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,240
thrive and grow and a lot of people will

396
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,919
discard different strains because they

397
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,120
didn't you know do well but they didn't

398
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,958
have their environment dialed or they

399
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,879
had other issues or spikes or you know

400
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,958
water issues or different issues so and

401
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,240
they would ultimately go to the strain

402
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,518
and kind of put that off so you know

403
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,120
some strains don't get him be able to

404
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,879
live and be able to show this one was

405
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
tough the first i this is the second

406
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,759
plan i grew the first one was uh i

407
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,759
didn't have the same results

408
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,240
get some of that just dried in the back

409
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
seat of the car on the way over

410
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,000
here so incredibly fruity it lost a

411
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,599
little bit of that future yeah yeah

412
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,839
you'll smell it you know in the end you

413
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,879
know but it is it's fruit fruit up front

414
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,440
wow and almost like a minty fruit yeah

415
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,958
that's fantastic i i love what you're

416
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
saying about

417
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,638
data and testing and testing your well

418
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,479
water and yeah that's something we're

419
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
focusing more on too we just brought in

420
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,879
a soil lab called imperial analytics

421
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,198
okay so that we can have soil samples

422
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,198
sent to us yeah we can test and process

423
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,120
it and send you your fertility back so

424
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,198
you can actually compare that with your

425
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,240
sap testing and be like okay my soil's

426
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:55,838
got this

427
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,159
but my plant's missing it what's going

428
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,240
on what's my uptake issue or

429
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,838
i've got way too much k in here yeah i

430
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,159
don't need that i'm wasting money

431
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,079
dumping all this extra fertilizer in so

432
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,120
we want to help kind of feed that

433
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,359
knowledge quest and yeah kind of data

434
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
fuel for sure it's important you know we

435
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,560
take

436
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,000
50 leaf samples per zone off nine flower

437
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:20,000
zones plus three veg zones a week plus a

438
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,360
well water sample a b c plus a mixed

439
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,879
sample and everything mixed together and

440
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,320
then a runoff sample and then we'll

441
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,879
compare what was in our plans completed

442
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,480
runoffs and adjust a mix that that ryan

443
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,559
developed for the last couple years and

444
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,720
adjust that mix to benefit you know what

445
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,239
i mean we always had adjustments to make

446
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,839
with that you know and that's

447
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
ro is obviously different you know

448
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,160
that's obviously beneficial because you

449
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,159
strip all the elements out and you know

450
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,600
so you know i love i mean for a crop

451
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,120
that's this valuable

452
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
you know in the grow that we're building

453
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,078
i'm i'm going our own all right yeah

454
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,759
we're not going to you know deal with

455
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,439
the vehicles eliminate that where we

456
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,198
live especially we're surrounded by

457
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,880
agriculture i mean i want to say yeah

458
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,319
your water water challenge we've got

459
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,799
changes where nitrates have changed

460
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,959
overnight where we've got you know

461
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,759
oh yeah a lot a lot more build up in

462
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,119
nitrates more uh chloride i mean it's it

463
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,399
was it was a struggle you know different

464
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,399
times of the year

465
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,879
water is shallow you know it's 120 feet

466
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,320
deep so i mean

467
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,399
it's a lot more influenced by what

468
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,639
happens above you yeah so yeah and we

469
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,759
adapted and we'll be able to adjust and

470
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,720
learn a lot of things and be sure to

471
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,838
also

472
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
class with the water that we were

473
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,240
pumping out

474
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,040
six or seven hundred parts per

475
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:25,920
yeah that just reinforces that

476
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:25,919
you million

477
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,720
importance not only testing your soil

478
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,319
testing your sap but test that

479
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,320
irrigation water that's another service

480
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,759
we offer at imperial too so yeah that's

481
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,839
awesome so and then it's coming out of

482
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,039
the same lab as your soil test so you

483
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,079
data as well we're not doing tissue

484
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,078
are know your

485
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,440
that's a bigger nut to crack and yeah

486
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:49,198
when we brought the lab in we really

487
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,120
wanted to focus on providing ourselves

488
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:54,599
the services that we needed a quick

489
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,600
turnaround tomorrow

490
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,799
it's 100 critical we take a line sample

491
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
and we need to have that information

492
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,799
immediately like you as a grower yeah

493
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,639
you're like i need this snapshot and i

494
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,958
need it now before i do something else

495
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,799
that changes it especially when you're

496
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,799
growing something like rockwool where

497
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,838
you get a lot of results fast or you see

498
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,120
a lot of

499
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,720
changes fast you're dealing with an

500
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,399
issue you want to get results right away

501
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,720
so you can make those changes hopefully

502
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,078
you try to catch those issues way early

503
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,519
on or you eliminate those issues from

504
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,278
the beginning like we were talking about

505
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,639
you know the last ship samples out so

506
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,399
you're dealing with lead times you know

507
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,839
they have to ship it out and wait for a

508
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,679
third party to process it and send it

509
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,839
back to them you know so finding the

510
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,599
right lab is is one of the key factors

511
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,040
in this where you can get the results

512
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,360
fast you know i mean that's that's

513
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,439
something we i think that you know the

514
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,639
lab where we kind of we live out will be

515
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,120
great you know because where we're at

516
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,039
kind of the labs are pretty far this is

517
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,039
the way so it's more challenging or even

518
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,399
in this lab eventually you know

519
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,399
something you can do just for your own

520
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,839
testing somebody that can do you know

521
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,278
on-site you know you don't test them to

522
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
keep on top of those kind of things so

523
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,078
yeah and that's the challenge and that's

524
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,519
why we

525
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,120
at royal gold we're like we have to

526
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,039
maintain this lab that you know the

527
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,558
local people dirty business soil

528
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,480
consulting they were

529
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,199
done with the lab moving on to their

530
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,439
education and like crop consulting were

531
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,519
putting that first and we're like we

532
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,400
need this for us but we need it for the

533
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,599
community we need to offer this service

534
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,439
we talked about just bringing it

535
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,599
internal and not allowing people to

536
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,000
submit samples anymore and we're like no

537
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,639
yeah we need to provide this for people

538
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,318
and it really has come a long way really

539
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,919
quickly i grew up working in ag man i

540
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,519
worked for a soil laboratory for three

541
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,840
years you know so all i did was take

542
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,798
soil samples petiole samples leave

543
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,319
samples and process data and

544
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,319
you know correlate that to what we had

545
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,000
to give the field to you know get it

546
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,798
back to where it needed to be so i mean

547
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,798
that

548
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,480
that i grew up at a young age seeing

549
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,400
that and the importance of it you know

550
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,079
in the field you know on a grand scale

551
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
of you know tens of thousands of acres

552
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,960
you know so

553
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,639
yeah it is no different than what we're

554
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,960
doing you know and people on that level

555
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,038
of ag they don't cut corners on them

556
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,079
they do not at

557
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:01,839
a core all

558
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,519
of their program that hundred dollar

559
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,879
test could save you a thousand dollars

560
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,879
and miss applied nutrients

561
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,558
yeah

562
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,240
and that's where the other thing that's

563
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,038
really important is

564
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,120
methodology like testing the native soil

565
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,359
here in las vegas is a different process

566
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,918
they're testing a potting media they're

567
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,759
testing a hybrid media and that's where

568
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,360
i think you know cultivators like

569
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,599
yourself you know what's in that soil

570
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,599
you know all right hey i need a native

571
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,159
test on this because it is not a lot of

572
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,918
organic matter this is a mineral soil or

573
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,600
hey this is all potting media i need a

574
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,280
potting media test because it's

575
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,038
different extractions to show you what's

576
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,639
available what's already in the media

577
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,720
before you put your plants in you want

578
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
to

579
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,678
levels of what you know what you have in

580
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,519
there exactly yeah which compounds or

581
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,720
which macro or micro nutrients you're

582
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,319
having or

583
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,839
those kind of things you know so it's

584
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,200
important you know it's also

585
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,159
quality of the plan you know not just

586
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,160
you important for

587
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,240
financially but if you're trying to

588
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
produce the best quality you can and do

589
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
the best you can and you want to check

590
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,639
all those things and you want to make

591
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
sure that you have all that dialed in

592
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,759
right you know because when you step

593
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,200
back and you're done and there's

594
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,480
something that you're not happy with you

595
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,480
automatically start thinking about all

596
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
those little details yeah and you're man

597
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,360
i wish i would have done that or man i

598
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,280
wish i would have did this and this and

599
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,199
that so the next time what you do is you

600
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,879
do those things and over the years and

601
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,600
over the different grows and gardens and

602
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,200
that you put in you slowly eliminated

603
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,359
and changed and adjusted to where you

604
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,558
just automatically do all those things

605
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,599
even though it's a little more it might

606
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,960
cost a little more or whatever in the

607
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,759
beginning you do those because in the

608
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
end

609
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,919
you're going to have a better product

610
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,519
and you're going to be happy with what

611
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,240
you did you know and so

612
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,240
you learn that over time

613
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,879
yeah we're on mj biz here las vegas 2021

00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,798
but uh the cookie land and all the

639
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,599
crosses that we've made with it

640
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,960
the grow is is getting built as we speak

641
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,199
so uh

642
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,000
we're hoping you know may of next year

643
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,279
is kind of our eta of being operational

644
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,960
and then

media and you know stay tuned to see

647
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,000
what we end up doing there because it's

648
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,200
going to be a fun one where can people

649
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,919
find you online at bosque genetics

650
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,080
is my main account uh that that'll be

651
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,240
you know for the grow uh bosque cannabis

652
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,000
and bosque consulting um we we do

653
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,519
consulting as well so i mean that's

654
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,599
that's the other side of here right now

[Music]

673
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,240
you know

674
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,000
the look and a lot of frost and the

675
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,440
right smell and the terpenes i mean some

676
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,960
people can't deny it you know even it's

677
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
green purple whatever

678
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,558
if you open it you're true it's kind of

679
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,240
sore a smoker those people are gonna you

680
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,240
know at least try it and i want to get

681
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,319
the good flavor and a good clean burn

682
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,558
and you get that good xl flavor you know

683
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,918
and it just you know all the things that

684
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,359
happen when you smoke good flour you

685
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,960
know it's undeniable so i think that as

686
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,359
long as we put out a good brand a good

687
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,679
brand a good quality flour that's truly

688
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,759
quality all around not just bag of peel

689
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,919
but also a nose to it also flavor you

690
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,919
know great xl a great high to it clean

691
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,120
height to it i think that it a lot of

692
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,919
people are going to come on board with

693
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,199
that and so as long as we do our job and

694
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,799
and make sure that we're doing a good

695
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,080
job when we're in our garden and making

696
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,038
sure we're carrying ourselves correctly

697
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,960
and doing the right things that we

698
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,960
should do in our garden and trying to

699
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,880
put all those years of experience into

700
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
that and are disciplined in what we're

701
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,039
doing i think that it will just all come

702
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,959
with it you know as people learn about

703
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,519
it and start smoking our flour i think

704
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,110
that it will definitely grow

705
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,240
we want people to try it you know

706
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:08,079

714
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,879
come from that that industry so we all

715
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,480
know that a lot of people say

716
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,440
that they do this or they produce that

717
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,038

721
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,119
problem putting it on the table so if

anybody else can put on table and it's

723
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,879
not that we're trying to be cocky or a

724
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,558
competition in that but we're confident

725
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,760
in the way that we carry ourselves and

726
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,440
