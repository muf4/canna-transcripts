1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,618
please

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:22,140
[Music]

3
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:25,800
hey everybody Chad Westport here it is

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,500
day 44 on the nakatomi Plaza grow we are

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,420
getting close to the end a couple of

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,899
them are showing signs are going to be

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,000
done really soon uh there's one and a

8
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,239
half we'll just call it two that look

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,700
like they may go a week longer but let's

10
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,799
go in and take a look at them

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,960
all right so we had three of the same

12
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,359
height and three with the same bud

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,399
structure they're all similar but again

14
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:54,359
just trying to group them into

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,020
categories this one I did not defoliate

16
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:01,619
but the one to on the right side of the

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,700
tent was actually same height same shape

18
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:08,219
same everything except I defoliated it

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,780
so we'll kind of see if you know all of

20
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,780
a sudden the defoliated one has much

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,939
larger smaller Buds versus the one with

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,560
the least still on it so that's just

23
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,618
kind of a fun little experiment that I'm

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,200
doing on this grow out the one thing I

25
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:25,560
will say is this one still has a lot

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,820
more white pistols stigmas actually a

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,799
lot more white stigmas on it compared to

28
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:34,319
this one that I defoliated now is that

29
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,420
related or was it just maybe because I

30
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,699
bumped some of them and you know that

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,340
caused them to mature early we'll find

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,740
out but those are these two nakatomi

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,799
plazas and then we have this one in the

34
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:49,078
center which was one of the two taller

35
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,600
ones but it actually shares the same bud

36
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,000
structure as the other two shorter ones

37
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,179
I just showed you but this one I also

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,340
defoliated just uh wanted to create a

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,320
little more airflow around it again you

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,960
know it's like I shaved the legs on it

41
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:07,379
but the side branches are pretty compact

42
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,679
the bud set is pretty tight on there so

43
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,780
that was the other

44
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,479
nakatomi Plaza in here let's go take a

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,759
look at the ones in the back so here's

46
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,399
that nakatomi Plaza in back that you

47
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,318
know what I mean it really reminds me of

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,140
the Westport grape juice that's what

49
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:28,259
this thing looks like to me uh you know

50
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:31,318
it's just the color it's got decent you

51
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,239
know buds on the sides just all over the

52
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,039
place oh I can't see because the

53
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,020
camera's so freaking or the light's so

54
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,979
bright on the back of the camera I'm

55
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,980
just gonna move it around

56
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,199
and then there's this one in the back

57
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,420
which is just [ __ ] doinking up man

58
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:56,339
this thing is just putting on

59
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:59,219
powerful freaking colas on every Branch

60
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,159
tip you can see there's a little bit of

61
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:05,180
nutrient issues with the lease but you

62
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:09,060
know what it seems to be doing just fine

63
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:12,300
uh big old donkey Cola here

64
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,400
I mean do I need to like zoom out to get

65
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,120
it all shoot

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,459
yeah so that's the nakatomi plaza in the

67
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,879
back growing some nice

68
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,239
fatty buds wherever you look

69
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,318
and that one the smell is pretty damn

70
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,200
pungent

71
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,539
so that's a wrap day 44 of the nakatomi

72
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,359
plaza grow out again these are all being

73
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:40,139
grown under the spider farmer SE 5000

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:44,340
light it's a 480 watt light and they are

75
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:46,919
in the soham living soil water only soil

76
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,259
so I've actually given them one top

77
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,419
dressing of the kiss Organics nutrient

78
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,579
pack gave them one top dressing couple

79
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,098
weeks into flour but other than that

80
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,719
yeah this has been water only and

81
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,000
they're in the three gallon containers

82
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,939
which is smaller than the size that

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,280
soham actually recommends but you know

84
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,560
what I did a really quick veg on these I

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,620
just wanted to flip them Grill them out

86
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,080
for everybody to see the nakatomi plaza

87
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,879
so I'm glad you guys have followed this

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,040
grow so far probably a couple more

89
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,139
updates coming I'm guessing really only

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,060
a couple weeks left here these things

91
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,340
are going to start swelling filling out

92
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,639
turning brown and adding a little bit

93
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:28,258
