1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,680
so that's a great transition point like

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,119
to jump us forward a little bit because

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,199
i could sit and listen to these stories

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,480
of black bear and dead to her all day

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,239
but

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,080
i want to talk a little bit about

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,919
cultivation and how

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,320
we got to where we are now with you out

9
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,278
doing the designing cult and consulting

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,359
so

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,600
i first visited your farm scarlet fire

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,920
farms out in willow creek

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,679
what was it probably seven years ago now

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,279
or so yeah it was 2015 2016. yeah i

15
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,439
believe when we were filming an episode

16
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,679
of growing exposed which you can check

17
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,599
out still on the growing exposed website

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,759
it's still out there and

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,280
features brian

20
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,439
telling you some of the secrets that you

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,359
may have to pay him a bunch of money for

22
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,439
now to get them out to consult

23
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,840
so there's a lot of really cool things i

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,198
learned that day

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,879
but

26
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,238
one of them was that we owned the same

27
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,920
piece of land

28
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,679
i owned it apparently directly after you

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,640
in willow creek

30
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,399
and

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
you know that was one of my first

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
outdoor farms in humboldt and we

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
connected over the fact that well there

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
was no sun for about five months

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
and

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,760
you know among other things it was my

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,960
first exposure to

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
scaled up knf

39
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,280
making your own nutrients all the way

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,960
from scratch

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,000
literally you guys were

42
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,519
fermenting deer carcasses you were doing

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,319
all sorts just to harvesting your own

44
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,879
seaweed yeah we're trying everything

45
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,639
and that's where all these kind of new

46
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,478
modalities of cultivation and

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,840
permaculture and sustainability are

48
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,920
coming from as those days of

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,759
experimentation what led you to that

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,519
moment you know because i'm

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,879
you went down a long road of cultivation

52
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,519
with two lights in a closet apparently

53
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,399
tell us about some of that road

54
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,798
um as far as the you know the k f or

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,519
actually the modern nature farming which

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,840
is more of a you know

57
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,920
current way of explaining it was just

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,200
really intriguing to me you know i

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,920
started was introduced to a friend um

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
ancient dank on instagram and i was just

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,598
like kind of watching some of the stuff

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
that he was doing and it's like this is

63
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,759
so crazy like

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,598
why shouldn't why let's try this i mean

65
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,679
we're in the woods we can

66
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,318
grow what we need we can harvest what we

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
need let's give it a try you know and it

68
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,000
was kind of on the cutting edge you know

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,319
it was on the edge of like a big change

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,519
anyway so it was like how can we make

71
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,318
this change even more exciting all right

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,319
um

73
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,399
so yeah uh

74
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,479
of course with all the experience you

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,159
know the years and years of cultivation

76
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,919
i've tried pretty much everything you

77
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,400
know i started out with general

78
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:50,359
hydroponics you know the the green and

79
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,360
the green and the red

80
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,639
and then you know i tried

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,000
once they changed into the what is it

82
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,079
the

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,158
um

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,760
i can't remember their organic product

85
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,598
that they put out but

86
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,359
anyway we just changed into that oh

87
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,079
general organics general organic there

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,840
you go that's a slipped my mind yeah and

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
i was going hard with that one you know

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,200
that one worked real really well but as

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,080
we were kind of scaling from inside

92
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,719
to outside it just didn't really seem

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,599
like it would fit to be using bottles

94
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,680
you know expense purposes waste purposes

95
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,199
all that kind of stuff you know it's i

96
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
felt like when you're indoor you're kind

97
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,518
of creating this like little world your

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
little laboratory and you do all these

99
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,519
different things right because you have

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,439
to you're creating your own environment

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,680
so you know you feel like you're forced

102
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,000
to use bottles and whatnot and then also

103
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,799
the lack of knowledge that was out there

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
open for everyone to to have

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,920
so

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,400
again once i moved out into the

107
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,839
larger scale outdoor and i could do it

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,469
year after year during the wonderful 215

109
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,158
era

110
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:58,000
[Music]

111
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,239
we could start logging data and start

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,799
seeing different changes on what we were

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,360
using and you know it just when

114
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,680
suddenly realized we were dumping like a

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,159
thousand dollars of liquid nutrients

116
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,480
into the into the reservoir for one

117
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,199
feeding app you know in the height of

118
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,358
the season you're like holy [ __ ] i i

119
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,000
feed quite a lot you know

120
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,599
this can't balance out properly right so

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
i mean i feel like

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,439
as we were getting pushed towards this

123
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,600
legalization and regulation i think we

124
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,639
were also getting pushed into like real

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,280
business life yeah price yeah was slowly

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,400
sliding down year after year after year

127
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,879
yeah overhead was going up up up because

128
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,879
for whatever reason every reason land

129
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,560
costs were going up

130
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,040
you know yeah we went through and you

131
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,879
know a gas spike back then too so you're

132
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,199
dealing with that and

133
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,360
you know so um

134
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,120
yeah i just feel like i was like okay

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,280
well let's make some changes because you

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,399
know the prices are dropping and there's

137
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,079
more competition

138
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,198
and so let's see if we can create our

139
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,038
own niche

140
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,120
and that's really kind of what got got

141
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,319
me down that road i really enjoyed it um

142
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,280
i feel like

143
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:13,038
nowadays everybody's so

144
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,198
hell-bent on data and

145
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,599
analytics and all that kind of stuff

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,759
that it really started getting a little

147
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,520
strange for me personally like i'm

148
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,240
making all these beautif these wonderful

149
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,159
things they all smell absolutely gross

150
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,478
the plants seem to love it

151
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,639
but what are we actually putting into

152
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,478
the plants because we don't have any

153
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,038
we're not getting tests we're like you

154
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,360
know if if we're ferment if we ferment

155
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,199
this product for three days longer than

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,879
we did the last time it could be a

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,680
completely different thing

158
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,600
right

159
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
what's coming out of the inputs right

160
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,639
how quickly there's a lot of questions

161
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,959
yeah and in my experience

162
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,319
sorry modern nature farmers but in my

163
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:57,439
experience i saw a yield drop

164
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,038
now i did see a quality increase

165
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,120
and we're always more interested in

166
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,120
quality than quantity right

167
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,680
but breaking the balance striking the

168
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,600
balance is key and in a changing uh

169
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,840
climate that you're dealing with and i

170
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,400
mean family and all the different things

171
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,198
that you generate as you grow

172
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,239
yeah um it was just you know it was

173
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,478
i had to

174
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,879
take a step away from that and kind of

175
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,519
go back to a more

176
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,959
conventional form of

177
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,318
cultivation

178
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,478
um

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,919
makes sense yeah and it's a lot i mean

180
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,399
now i'm seeing that it's a little bit

181
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,879
easier for me to relay what i'm trying

182
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,519
to teach these different farms that i go

183
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,199
to when i can have a product that's

184
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,318
basically you know the exact same thing

185
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,639
every time

186
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,720
repetition is key when you're trying to

187
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,400
push a product into market

188
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,919
especially now where it's not like oh

189
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,519
well this guy's buying it this time this

190
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,359
guy's buying it the next time it could

191
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,879
be going anywhere

192
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
you're probably

193
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,240
needing to fit into a niche in the

194
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,758
regulated market where you're selling to

195
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,918
the same set of people that take it to

196
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
the same set of dispensaries

197
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,839
you know even if it's kind of a

198
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,840
revolving cast it's you know it's an

199
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,439
established cast and you have to have

200
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,399
consistency

201
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,478
so

202
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,120
did that lead you to

203
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,758
really kind of going back more almost to

204
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,560
salts or did you end up seeing more like

205
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,919
hybrid technology or

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,160
what's

207
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:25,598
what are you seeing now as the

208
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,560
consistent way to get that output

209
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:32,159
well i've always tried to follow the the

210
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,079
natural input mindset you know

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,720
organic whatever

212
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,719
organish

213
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,680
but i've always kind of stood along

214
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,519
those lines you know once i got away

215
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,240
from the general hydroponic or the you

216
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,038
know the the hydroponic the whatever

217
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,639
yeah

218
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,399
the go boxes that's how i always

219
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,598
remember it general organics because

220
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,000
they had those boxes yeah that's crazy

221
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,759
yeah so i always try to stay with the

222
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,598
natural stuff i've never really been

223
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,400
into salts

224
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,240
as like you know a nutrient base and i'm

225
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,839
sure that there's a lot of

226
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,120
place for that in the new industry

227
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,959
because

228
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,519
you know there's a lot more data

229
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,399
collected there's a lot more

230
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,560
instruments designed to read that data

231
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,519
that you know you're trying to find

232
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,439
um

233
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,279
but i've always wanted organic because i

234
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,279
vote i'm a smoker

235
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,119
i'm like

236
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,519
when i'm growing weed i'm only smoking

237
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,360
my weed you know i mean there's other

238
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,799
people that i know that

239
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,560
i hold in a high regard that i would

240
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,918
smoke theirs too

241
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,399
but

242
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,399
i'm growing for myself number one and my

243
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,320
family and my friends you know so i

244
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,519
always wanted to be at least natural

245
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,560
um

246
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,480
we all want three pounds of light but

247
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,000
do we want to smoke the weed that is

248
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,360
typically created off of the three

249
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,600
pounds of light

250
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,720
not every time not every time right so

251
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,920
yeah that's why i always just stuck with

252
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,920
organic type nutrients and

253
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,319
natural inputs

254
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,319
awesome

255
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,519
were you still making teas and doing it

256
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,640
that way are you more into amending

257
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,560
well i like to do a soil amendment

258
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,759
you know i'm really big into soil

259
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,319
analysis

260
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:22,958
so you can track what's being put in and

261
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,440
what's actually being used up um i'm i'm

262
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,559
a big feeder i like feeding the plant so

263
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
i'll do

264
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,958
a

265
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,639
light amendment mix you know i'll juice

266
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,599
up the soil a little bit but then i like

267
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,919
to do a feeding and my my choice of

268
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,000
product these days is bio biz because

269
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,439
it's very natural product they've been

270
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,519
out in the game for

271
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,000
they're celebrating their 30th year this

272
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,839
month wow um and

273
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,200
most of their product or their products

274
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,800
are derived from beets sugar beets

275
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
and it's a fermenting process that they

276
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,000
use too so it's you know

277
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,240
in a fashion it is similar to the modern

278
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,120
nature farming

279
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,519
but

280
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,720
with the consistency of a bottled

281
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,480
product

282
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,600
yeah it's got a ton of sugars there's

283
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,519
some kelp

284
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,560
yeah it's i mean it's it's a it's a

285
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,679
great product i really like using it

286
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,639
it's very

287
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,919
forgiving you know you you know it's not

288
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,919
that's one of the things i've learned

289
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,319
with salts is that it's not very

290
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,879
forgiving and typically the environment

291
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,360
that you have to create to

292
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,360
utilize salts efficiently is not

293
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,278
necessarily the

294
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,839
environment that i'm trying to create

295
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,838
yeah being like rock wool and things

296
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,399
like that well you eliminate so much of

297
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,640
the microbiology which a product like

298
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,720
biobiz especially

299
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,319
i always really liked that as a liquid

300
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
when i used liquids too it was one of my

301
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,920
favorites

302
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,600
because the biology aspect you're

303
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,278
feeding the soil yeah if you start with

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,759
an amended soil like

305
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,320
power flower back in the day i loved bio

306
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,480
biz with pi power flower because that

307
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,519
you know rich sugary

308
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,440
it's kind of a mild nutrient really it

309
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,560
really is kind of a mild nutrient it's

310
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,240
definitely not something you're going to

311
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,559
burn a plant with i mean you could

312
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,919
probably pour the product straight into

313
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,838
the plant it wouldn't

314
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,240
it wouldn't burn the pro the plant we're

315
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,640
not recommending that at home but you

316
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,320
probably could

317
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,399
and that's always been my mo when it

318
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,360
comes to feeding though i've never been

319
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,679
a huge fan of pushing the ppms to the to

320
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
the brink into the stress point like i

321
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,278
like to get close

322
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,959
right you know but i've always kind of

323
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,439
been more more or less on the like you

324
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,719
know on a moderate strength nutrient

325
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,040
regimen and then obviously i've always

326
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,278
been big on t's too which i feel like

327
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,360
naturally kind of get your get that

328
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,439
extra charge in there yeah you know but

329
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,320
through a fermentation process yeah

330
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,800
absolutely um what i'm seeing

331
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,480
with everybody scaling so large so fast

332
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,559
that i'm seeing people start running

333
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,720
into problems with teas and things like

334
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,879
that because there's

335
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,839
employee turnover there's you know

336
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,879
whatever the different factors may be so

337
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,720
so typically when i go to a farm

338
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,240
i'm not pushing t's and things because

339
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
that's a whole nother learning curve

340
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,039
that somebody needs to learn he's like

341
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,199
let's get let's get the ship rated you

342
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:18,078
know let's get you going

343
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,399
and once you start you know seeing some

344
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,879
you know ground being covered and seeing

345
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,159
some increase in some things then let's

346
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,958
veer off and try some high-level stuff

347
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,120
right yeah create a sense of stability a

348
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,599
platform to build on that's right

349
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,919
something we say all the time to you

350
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,159
know we get phone calls from new growers

351
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,679
daily at royal gold and it's like hey

352
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,360
start simple

353
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,039
don't like try everything at once

354
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,039
because how do you really know what

355
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,480
you're doing at that point like you

356
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,799
don't know whether this product worked

357
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,159
or that product worked or this one is

358
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,599
effective or

359
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,519
what burned your plant if you're

360
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,639
throwing all of these things at it all

361
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,799
the time so

362
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,759
i completely agree with that perspective

363
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,559
of like

364
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:03,519
whoa whoa whoa let's strip out the duff

365
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:06,159
let's get to a baseline

366
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,679
and create some new avenues towards

367
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:12,879
improving it it's it's k it's the truth

368
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,120
um i hear a lot um you know cut your

369
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,000
costs on nutrients cut your costs on

370
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,679
food and honestly like if you want

371
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,078
optimum

372
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,239
results would do you starve

373
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,799
you know would you starve the cow if you

374
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,200
want the best meat no you probably would

375
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,278
i see what my biggest thing that i see

376
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,560
when i go to all these different farms

377
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:37,519
that i've been is procedure

378
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,838
they just lack procedure

379
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,278
which causes

380
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,680
more labor cost and chaos and chaos so i

381
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,240
feel like my mindset when i go to farms

382
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,519
is typically let's get a procedure going

383
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,039
we're not going to starve your plants

384
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,000
because it costs money to feed them

385
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,599
we're going to starve your labor

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
because it costs money to feed that too

387
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,680
because it does yeah you know we get

388
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,680
complete procedure in place

389
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,359
you know you have these milestone

390
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,159
targets that you're going to have to hit

391
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,639
every single harvest so after the second

392
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:11,519
one it's muscle memory

393
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,240
and then you guys are off and running

394
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,919
and

395
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,959
yeah that's that's really interesting

396
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,639
because with feeding and i'm you know

397
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,679
kind of equating this in my head as we

398
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,879
speak

399
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,958
there's

400
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,039
diminishing returns at some point yes

401
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,599
you want to feed you need to feed i'm a

402
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,838
big plant feeder i want to push it

403
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,839
but there is a point especially at scale

404
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,880
where it hits diminishing returns

405
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,680
where okay i'm giving plants nutrients

406
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,600
now

407
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,759
that they aren't able to consume in a

408
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,680
realistic time it's washing out it's

409
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,838
being consumed by microbiology that's

410
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,838
not effectively contributing to

411
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,839
real-time plant growth

412
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,680
you can overdo it

413
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,959
and the same is true of labor and that's

414
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,799
something we're seeing in humboldt

415
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,078
county big time

416
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,039
in this

417
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,799
crazy press on mom and pop farmers that

418
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,958
have been doing it forever

419
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,958
they're having to eliminate labor

420
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,638
everywhere nobody can afford the labor

421
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,000
because it's a diminishing return you're

422
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,198
paying all this money for these people

423
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,039
to be out there

424
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,159
stripping the plants giving all this

425
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,879
care

426
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,198
but

427
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,958
the cost per pound is so low now we have

428
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,759
to find ways

429
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:20,719
to prop the farmers up and they have to

430
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,958
find ways to cut those costs and

431
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,040
there's a diminishing return in over

432
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:28,000
feeding and over labor and over

433
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,559
application of anything yeah right

434
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,480
that's a good good generalization of it

435
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,679
for sure absolutely

436
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,839
no it's true

437
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,159
um

438
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,759
yeah i think that

439
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,399
there's so many the stakes are so high

440
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,159
now

441
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,480
right you know

442
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,719
there's no time to mess around

443
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,278
there's no time to have that bro that's

444
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,560
you know kind of a lazy guy but he's

445
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,958
your bro

446
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,799
so like you know i'll keep them on

447
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,159
you know there's those days are it's a

448
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,879
shame but

449
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,759
the culture is being stripped away

450
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,559
to

451
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,919
you know

452
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,919
some degree

453
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,039
and that's and that's where we're seeing

454
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,559
it right

455
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,799
yeah and i

456
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,559
like what you said there it is a lot of

457
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,000
people that are making hard decisions

458
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,599
for people that they care about and

459
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,519
saying hey man

460
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,120
i'm sorry i can't afford to employ you

461
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,600
anymore i can't afford to have you live

462
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,000
here on the farm and like work hard for

463
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,920
the pushes but like kick your feet up

464
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,799
for you know four months of the six

465
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,639
month

466
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,039
grow season and

467
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,560
they're hard decisions being made

468
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,799
by people that really care about each

469
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,719
other and that's one of the things that

470
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,679
we're really fighting hard to kind of

471
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,759
help

472
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,078
right the ship with measure s and now

473
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,839
everybody's trying to get to sacramento

474
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:42,799
to start looking at taxation because

475
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,759
these are

476
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:48,958
decisions that are affecting

477
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,360
the overall impact economically and

478
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,339
socially of cannabis on the communities

479
00:16:51,360 --> 00:17:04,679
