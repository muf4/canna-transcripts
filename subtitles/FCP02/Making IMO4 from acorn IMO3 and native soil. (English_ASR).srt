1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,520
all righty today I'm going to be making

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,199
im4 this is Acorn imo3 that just came

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,879
out of Gasoline

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,879
Alley get a chunk of it let's look at it

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,240
look at that nice

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,519
stuff that is Acorn

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:26,198
imo3 you can see all the IMO all over it

8
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,198
that Acorn imo3 was made with logs that

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,480
look like this right here mushrooms

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,359
growing out of them everywhere ground up

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,640
tons of logs like this added acorn meal

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:39,439
that I gathered around my house got them

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,920
all crushed up added some inputs and

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,920
things like that cook that in Gasoline

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,600
Alley so now I'll be taking this

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,320
imo3 and I'm going to be using some

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,439
native soil that I got I'll show you

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,000
where I got it and I'll be adding some

19
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:58,558
inputs and I'll show you here we

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,878
go all right and this is IMO 4 material

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,839
I'm getting some native soil oil out

22
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,878
from

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
underneath all of that right there get

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,079
all those

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,000
mushrooms but this will be native soil

26
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,719
I'll be using to advance my

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,799
imo3 to

28
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,959
im4 and I just went and got a bunch of

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
chicken manure today for5 so that's what

30
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,359
we're getting right there that's going

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,478
to be good

32
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:28,078
stuff all right so first I'm going to

33
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:32,158
mix this up basically equal

34
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:32,158
parts it's still under 5

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,040
gallon equal parts of native soil that I

36
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:42,399
got from Outback that you saw in those

37
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,439
videos and then about the same amount

38
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,478
Acorn IMO 3 I'll also be adding the

39
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,478
inputs and I'll show

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,920
you I just kind of mix it up

41
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,718
to something I think it looks like I can

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,159
grow

43
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:02,078
in I need that a little more soil

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,079
remember it's going to get

45
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,318
wet but if that right there was wet

46
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,199
would it be a good growing

47
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:14,920
medium man it's getting real close to

48
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,919
it might add a little more

49
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,640
soil all right so there's the first

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,640
batch kind know what it looks

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,480
like it's real good that looks like

52
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:35,159
something that I could grow in it's like

53
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,119
a good pretty much a good

54
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,959
soil so I'm going to make a little bit

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,560
more making it right here this little

56
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,080
tote it's Acorn

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,080
imo3 native

58
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,158
soil a little mix

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,280
and I want enough to feel this tote

60
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,640
right

61
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,719
here look at the contrasting

62
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,598
color that's what comes with native soil

63
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,598
native

64
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,518
creatures that's what makes it

65
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:16,119
good I never worry about creatures or

66
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
things I see out in the native soil I

67
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,120
just let them come along let them come

68
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,359
along and keep doing what they do all

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,158
right here's the mix we got a little jlf

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,799
in the bucket I'm going to make a mix

71
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:29,438
pour it all in and then if I need more

72
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,640
moisture I just going to add water look

73
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:34,120
at that that is hashw waterer Labs look

74
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,119
how got the purple Hue to it the

75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,599
Cannabis we used or the Cannabis we

76
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,120
washed was very purple this is Alfalfa

77
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:47,119
and kelp

78
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,759
FP made by atona farmer gentics this is

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,759
some sea

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,680
water this is Oriental herbal nutrient

81
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:01,679
this is fish amino acid from Marco

82
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,680
growing all that going to get mixed up

83
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,199
there's the full wheelbarrow this is

84
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,400
going to get poured all over it and then

85
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,199
if I need more moisture I'll add water

86
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,400
but this everything has a little bit of

87
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,479
moisture in it right now that native

88
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,199
soil

89
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:23,798
does get this all in there start

90
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,799
mixing all righty mix it

91
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,600
up water kind of drains to the bottom a

92
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,599
little bit

93
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:46,478
a little more water in I might even add

94
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,400
some rice

95
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:52,399
holes break this up a little bit more

96
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,719
the native soil is a little more compact

97
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,959
not bad more compact than

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,199
compost I often use

99
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,560
compost for this method for my own

100
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,560
growing

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,079
but you can see how the dirt will kind

102
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,800
of Clump little bit of rice hole little

103
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,120
bit of uh oh wheat brand will help that

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,120
out a

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,280
lot all right going to add some rice

106
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,080
holes that will help break that soil up

107
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,879
a

108
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:38,079
bit and a bit of wheat

109
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,120
brand always

110
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,639
good now I'll definitely have to add

111
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,639
more moisture with all these dry

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,478
ingredients but this will just make it a

113
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,479
better growing medium just from

114
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,079
experience and it's it does have to be

115
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,160
moist cuz you have it has to get

116
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,000
inoculated

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,080
it's dry it just doesn't work well but

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,560
again not wet

119
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,560
moist everybody

120
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,399
moist

121
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:51,279
oh that's

122
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,799
perfect all right so the im4 has been

123
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,280
made now these are two different types

124
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,800
of im4 they're both made from Acorn imo3

125
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,359
this one was made from native soil this

126
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,800
one was made from compost this is

127
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,120
actually the bucket that I took to the

128
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,038
Mushroom Festival this year and it's

129
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,399
been what I've I'm growing in gasoline

130
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:15,038
Alle but let me show you it just comes

131
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,120
out in beautiful sections and brownies

132
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,120
cuz it's got high F all in

133
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,280
it really good stuff but see it just you

134
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:27,439
want to look like something you can grow

135
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:30,559
in a good soil that's what the im4 level

136
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:34,399
is for me anyway way it's something that

137
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,120
I use to grow in so I'm going to make a

138
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,839
few batches of im4 because you need im4

139
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,598
to advance theo5 and you need you need a

140
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,239
couple of IMO fours you need a couple of

141
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,079
IMO 5 so that's why I've made all that

142
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,199
Acorn imo3 I want to make a lot of IMO

143
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,878
fours so that I can make a couple more

144
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,439
IMO 5S all right I'm going to close this

145
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,840
up put in Gasoline Alley and show you

146
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,839
the conditions I use all righty here's

147
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:58,439
the cooking conditions inside Gasoline

148
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,158
Alley one space heater some guny sacks

149
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,839
that I'll put on top

150
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:04,120
I like to kind of poke some holes in it

151
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,119
like

152
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,959
this and those holes will start to see

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,879
high feet grow all in

154
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,038
them it'll

155
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:18,000
take four or five

156
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,038
days it's going to stay covered up that

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,038
right

158
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,959
there space heater kind of close don't

159
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,439
burn

160
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,598
nothing and that's it about 5 days I

161
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,598
have some good

162
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:29,598
im4
