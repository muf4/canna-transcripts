and you feel like you need a little

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,400
upper

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,960

church welcome to cali high episode 54

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,640
i'm your host chenzo nico and this week

14

owner and ceo of the humboldt seed

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,558
company

17
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,919
as planting season draws near we talk

18
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,238
with nat about the new strains at the

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,640
humbled seed company the selection and

20
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,959
process for making a stabilized strain

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
improved quality of autoflower strains

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,520
how to save a phenotype with tissue

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,000
culture trends in strain popularity and

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,760
commercial versus personal seed choices

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
we also talk about the current problems

26
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,439
with the legalization of cannabis in

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,519
california and more

28
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,959
coming from a science background matt is

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,359
one of the best informed people in

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,118
cannabis breeding and as in our previous

31
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,280
interviews with him he lays out a

32
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,280
cornucopia of valuable knowledge before

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,599
us in this must-see episode

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,439
that also appears in cali high episodes

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,079
39-23

36
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,079
stay tuned

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
kelly high is blessed to be here with

38
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,798
nat pennington for the third time

39
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,280
good morning nat how are you

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,720
good morning doing well excellent

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,680
um

42
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,879
so

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
you know we were going to talk about a

44
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,199
few things today the state of cannabis

45
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,399
but before we get to that part i just

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,240
want to find out what's going on with

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,280
the humble seed company

48
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,239
um

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,159
so

50
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,839
what new strains are on the lineup this

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,439
year

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,799
we've got some pretty exciting new

53
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,319
strains out this year uh

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,360
we

55
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,639
we've been

56
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,519
definitely putting a little bit more

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,439
uh

58
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,199
giving autoflower some more attention

59
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,239
and it that's been sort of like a

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,118
gradual process over the last i don't

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,599
know

62
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,280
seven eight years but

63
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,759
uh

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,080
it took a while for our you know like to

65
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,120
convince ourselves that

66
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,800
there was

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,560
you know

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
i mean the biggest thing that i always

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,598
kind of point

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,039
point out is that

71
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,759
i really truly believe that there's no

72
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,519
baggage that comes along with the auto

73
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,519
flowering

74
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,599
trait and so you know

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
when people say

76
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,679
autoflowers are

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,000
are this that or the other i mean if

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,400
they're referencing any

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,439
anything other than the fact that they

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
flower

81
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,039
automatically without having to change

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,439
the light

83
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,639
then it's a

84
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,479
it's a false stereotype i would say

85
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,559
that's something that i've

86
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,560
learned is is a fact i think it's got a

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,000
bad rap well i don't i mean yeah there's

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,959
been people that

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,598
have

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,280
you know said that they're just

91
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,238
i've heard things like oh they're all

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,439
crap or whatever stuff like that and

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,200
um

94
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,598
just like firsthand

95
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,799
experience there's

96
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,719
you can

97
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,239
through just i'm not even talking like

98
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,878
i'm not talking about

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,719
gene editing or anything weird

100
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,798
just through

101
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,840
traditional breeding practices selective

102
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,920
breeding

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,158
you can uh

104
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,199
essentially just kind of cut

105
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,039
that trait that is the

106
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,798
you know no matter what i'm gonna flower

107
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,359
after a month and a half or after a

108
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,360
month whatever um

109
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,440
and paste it into

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,400
whatever

111
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,598
style cannabis you want so whatever

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,920
you know

113
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,959
you can have the dankest cannabis in the

114
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,399
world could easily be an autoflower uh

115
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,560
yeah well that's great for outdoor

116
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,239
farmers right it's one more than one

117
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
crop i would imagine it's it's

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
convenient for a lot of people i mean

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,959
we've got a we've got a guy

120
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,479
who is i would say sort of a little bit

121
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,040
of a pioneer

122
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,560
who uh

123
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,639
you know what what i've always kind of

124
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,399
assumed is like our the

125
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,720
least likely

126
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,918
client that we would have as a genetics

127
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,120
company

128
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:31,839
especially for our autoflower varietals

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,519
or strains is is a like indoor

130
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,638
hydroponic type grow environment

131
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,519
and

132
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,840
we've got this indoor hydroponic person

133
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,959
who is just

134
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,599
absolutely loving

135
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,279
being able to run autoflowers because

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,199
you know it's just

137
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:53,198
zero you know pests zero pathogens

138
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,080
and it's just this like

139
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,079
incredibly low

140
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,360
low maintenance

141
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
process of just like sticking the seeds

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,199
in

143
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,879
to

144
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,038
you know he uses like sort of the rock

145
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,719
wool yeah yeah um

146
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:13,199
hydroponic growing style and

147
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,320
just you know plugging the seeds in

148
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,919
getting them

149
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,159
a few inches tall

150
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,719
trans planting them into the bigger

151
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,520
rockwool cubes and into the main

152
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,039
uh

153
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,038
you know what what you would normally

154
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,478
think of as a veg space

155
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,800
and uh

156
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,079
then it just goes and there's no like

157
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,478
having to

158
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:36,079
you know shut the lights down for

159
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:38,719
12 hours and and because of that

160
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,519
the plant is actually photosynthesizing

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,199
and

162
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,159
being able to build flower the entire

163
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,120
time

164
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,520
that

165
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,600
you know i think that they're leaving

166
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,959
do you know whether he's on like 20 hour

167
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,360
light 18 yeah so some people go

168
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,079
18 some people go 20.

169
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
and uh it actually is just like it's a

170
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,599
more efficient

171
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,879
way of growing and you you might not

172
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
necessarily think that because you're

173
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,959
like oh there's like more electricity

174
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,600
but actually that electricity

175
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,959
is being used by the plant to build more

176
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
flour

177
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,519
and it cuts down on on the number of

178
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,038
hours

179
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,799
therefore it stays

180
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,120
power right

181
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,038
well overall you can cut you can have a

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,600
quicker life cycle

183
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,560
um overall because you you know thinking

184
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,400
about

185
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,680
you know clones and having to keep

186
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,758
mothers

187
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,160
and that whole process of getting

188
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,160
something to where it's a you know a

189
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,880
five inch tall clone or

190
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,199
or whatever um that takes a lot of

191
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,800
energy and and people don't necessarily

192
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,840
think about it they're like well i just

193
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,639
pay

194
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,638
you know

195
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,840
eight dollars a clone or whatever and uh

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,598
but that eight dollars is is energy that

197
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,879
they've spent yeah yeah yeah and uh

198
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,159
you know

199
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,800
so

200
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,240
long story short there's i think a lot

201
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,800
of different applications that people

202
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,038
don't even realize the obvious ones are

203
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,918
like well you know we don't have to do

204
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,879
uh light depth

205
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:16,560
in the outdoor growing environment

206
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:19,839
which is a huge advantage and uh just

207
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,839
also just a lot of like agronomic

208
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,839
advantages and then we always think

209
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,839
about just the personal

210
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,239
grower and um

211
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,439
we think it's easier for them as well

212
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,598
just

213
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,199
have some plants in the backyard and you

214
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,159
can actually do it

215
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,639
you know at least two times in a summer

216
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,000
right for her and you know if your state

217
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,680
says

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,120
you can only have six plants or

219
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,478
something well

220
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,759
you can probably

221
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,079
have

222
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,199
two harvests and so then you can kind of

223
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:54,240
have 12 plants yeah exactly like the the

224
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,199
big new strains that we've released are

225
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,199
the potty mouth which is um was actually

226
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
kind of a collaborative project with our

227
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,439
friend jason

228
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,038
uh

229
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,800
ridgeline farms

230
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,240
who's a fellow humble farmer who just

231
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,038
kind of like

232
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,000
won emerald cups you know year after

233
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,680
year and uh is an excellent grower

234
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,680
obviously so

235
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,720
what's it like

236
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
it's

237
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,680
the reason that he

238
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,598
gave it the name pottymouth is because

239
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,720
it was so

240
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,680
um

241
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,639
it's the flower structure of it is not a

242
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,959
lot of

243
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,240
leaf not a lot of fluff it's just like

244
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,958
all the

245
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,320
the bracks that make up the best part of

246
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:43,038
the cannabis flower yeah and so when it

247
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,920
grows it just looks like this

248
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,039
monster like you know kind of all gnarly

249
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,039
like that

250
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,719
and uh

251
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,719
and that so he kind of came up with that

252
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,278
name we were like screw it you know the

253
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,519
cannabis strain names are

254
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,000
are off the wall these days no i know

255
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,879
anyway so

256
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,759
if we can have stuff called meat breath

257
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,958
and

258
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,439
you know yeah

259
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,639
whatever else garlic breath yeah

260
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,800
yeah then

261
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,319
you know we're just so anyway it's a

262
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,159
it's an awesome one and we just got the

263
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,040
test results back

264
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,919
uh

265
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:21,199
and it tested it 34 and that's through

266
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:24,319
like a lab in california that's

267
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
uh known for integrity

268
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,800
which you know

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,159
not

270
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,159
i don't want to

271
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,519
say but there's just so much going on

272
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,079
with the labs

273
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,879
yeah everywhere that and this stupid

274
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
race for thc we don't really

275
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,360
uh

276
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,278
personally

277
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,000
give it that much

278
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:48,559
credence but you know it definitely uh

279
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,519
seems like it's it's a driver for

280
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,359
economics yeah people like the high thc

281
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,360
numbers and you know

282
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,959
yeah they want to feel 34 is pretty high

283
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,120
i must say

284
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,159
yeah well especially from like a lab

285
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,959
that's

286
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,120
that's legit um

287
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,439
and then the farmer's daughter is

288
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,560
another one that was just this like

289
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,959
shining star in our final hunt efforts

290
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,879
in the last year and uh

291
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,799
that one was

292
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,360
a pleasure to be able to get out to the

293
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,639
world what would you compare these two

294
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,839
i mean

295
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,240
so

296
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,600
the potty mouth is like this

297
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,879
you know what seems to be

298
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,360
what people are

299
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,559
gravitating towards in the

300
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
sort of

301
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,439
vast commercial

302
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,399
marketplace is the purple uh

303
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,959
gassy and purple strain yeah

304
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,078
which you know we've always had

305
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,759
really good

306
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:50,239
purple gasty strains like our all gas og

307
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,559
is kind of a purple

308
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,720
royal highness is another one

309
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,278
that's like that that that we've had for

310
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,639
a long time and it's just funny how

311
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,559
i mean there was

312
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,360
a few years where

313
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,759
people

314
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,159
thought for some reason that

315
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,919
purple cannabis was

316
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,078
it turned purple because there was

317
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,399
something wrong with it like that

318
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,559
it had a

319
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
deficiency in a nutrient or something

320
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,000
like that

321
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,880
and of course we always knew that it was

322
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,278
just

323
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,679
genetic and we always like oh the purple

324
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:27,039
stuff is beautiful you know and it

325
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:30,799
it's good and stony and and all that

326
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,639
but it's just funny how um

327
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,199
you know the trend will go one way and

328
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,039
then it'll go another and so yeah i was

329
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,278
going to ask you about trans

330
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,199
quite some time

331
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,559
quite a while where

332
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,720
you know people were just like we don't

333
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,879
want any of that purple

334
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,800
don't give us any genetics that have the

335
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,078
purple and

336
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,719
now everybody wants purple flash forward

337
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,519
four years and and everybody's super

338
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,959
interested in the purple yeah um

339
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,399
one of your pineapple plants turned

340
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,679
purple for me

341
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,720
yeah yeah some of the yeah and the

342
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,039
lesson for me as a breeder is just has

343
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,399
always been more and more just like

344
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,360
trust

345
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,200
uh

346
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
trust your instincts

347
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,278
as a both a

348
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,200
smoker and a breeder

349
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,360
smoke what you like

350
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,079
who gives a [ __ ] you know like

351
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,519
what you hear is supposed to be the best

352
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,120
because

353
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,799
you know everybody's experience is

354
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,039
different and

355
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,039
uh

356
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,480
and the only way to to know is to get

357
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,000
out there and get in touch with the

358
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,920
plant and

359
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,278
and check stuff out

360
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,639
experiment

361
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,480
grow your own

362
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,639
uh-huh oh yeah

363
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
so one of my questions was you know have

364
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,320
you noticed trends towards certain

365
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,958
strains this year as as compared to

366
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,720
years past and i i see that that kind of

367
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,919
leads into it

368
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,639
um yeah the purple gas is

369
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,919
is really popular right now which is

370
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,959
great because

371
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,078
we we have lots of that stuff yeah

372
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,479
it still

373
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,199
has to be high in thc the the potty

374
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,879
mouth strain is really high in thc

375
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,680
and it's purple

376
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,439
it's gassy um

377
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,519
the vanilla cream pie is another one

378
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,839
that's purple and gassy and it's really

379
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,480
high in thc

380
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,560
some of the most strongest turpin ones

381
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,800
like the all gas og

382
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,039
and the royal royal highness like those

383
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,439
ones are probably

384
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,120
some of the most gassy

385
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,990
just

386
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,560
rank

387
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,600
[Laughter]

388
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,759
really you know super pungent

389
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,959
strains that we have

390
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,639
in that

391
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,879
kind of gas

392
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
genre uh

393
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,159
those ones

394
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,839
you know i i wouldn't say that they're

395
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,399
going to like

396
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
crush it with with the test results but

397
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,078
certainly

398
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,920
if people just want to

399
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,159
grow something that you know they're

400
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,319
going to enjoy

401
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,639
those are really good candidates for

402
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,480
that and and both of those the royal

403
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,639
highness and the all gas og are um

404
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,320
quick finishers too

405
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,600
so they they

406
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,000
only take you know until

407
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
like 50 days or

408
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,958
more

409
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
late september rather than

410
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,879
mid-october yeah

411
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,479
doctor that's cool what about farmer's

412
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,720
daughter

413
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,159
that one is

414
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,560
that one's

415
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,120
just it was this amazing fino that stood

416
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,198
out to us actually it was kind of funny

417
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,959
because you know we take all these

418
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,799
clones from

419
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,638
fields and fields

420
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,958
uh partnerships with

421
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,360
big farms all over the

422
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,518
you know really all over california

423
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
and uh

424
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
and

425
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,278
keep all these cuttings because we don't

426
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,198
want to lose anything so we take it the

427
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,958
cuttings like before they really are all

428
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,359
the way in flower

429
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,159
and then code everything so we can go

430
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,839
back and reference it but um

431
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,360
every now and again

432
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,920
there's something will just be so

433
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,720
amazing in one of the breeding chambers

434
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,639
that will go and try to

435
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,560
uh

436
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,240
you know we haven't necessarily cut

437
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:24,000
every clone in the breeding chambers and

438
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,480
that one was one of those and it was

439
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,120
like almost touch and go we were like

440
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,920
all right we're gonna try to re-veg it

441
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,039
and get it to come back out of flower

442
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,719
and and capture some clones off of it so

443
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,000
that we can preserve it because it was

444
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,480
just this

445
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,159
unbelievable standout

446
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,079
individual

447
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,759
yeah that's so cool

448
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,879
yeah out of a breeding chamber that was

449
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,919
like

450
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,399
i don't even know how many

451
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,240
siblings it had but it there were

452
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,639
you know

453
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,839
at least i would say a hundred um yeah

454
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,519
so you have to keep like a hundred

455
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,440
mothers going until you figure out which

456
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,919
one you want right or something well

457
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,399
that's i mean every year we do thousands

458
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,479
of them and we do that but mostly that's

459
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,639
just on stuff that we're not

460
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,920
pollinating so that's like right on

461
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,720
fields of sensemia whereas

462
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,360
we

463
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,120
don't tend to take cuttings off every

464
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,240
single thing that we're pollinating

465
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,600
because

466
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,919
i mean one of the things about

467
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,759
pollinating stuff is it kind of changes

468
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,559
the way that the flower is going to

469
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,759
express because it's full of seeds right

470
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,919
and so

471
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,759
but you can still tell a lot about

472
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,879
you know i mean it's you can

473
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,919
almost tell just as well basically that

474
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,519
if it

475
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,519
looks really good and smells really good

476
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,600
even if it's got seeds in it

477
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,480
so occasionally

478
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,959
we'll find something that's so amazing

479
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,839
that even though it's flowering and

480
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,479
seeded and and yada yada yada that we'll

481
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,560
just do our best to

482
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,120
get it back and put it back in the

483
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:04,639
vegetative you know get it back in veg

484
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,119
and and get cuts off of it yeah and

485
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,799
that's how the farmer's daughter started

486
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,359
it was just something that

487
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,720
stood out so much that we were like oh

488
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,558
my god you know

489
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,279
and and i honestly

490
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,879
i basically did tissue culture to get it

491
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:23,838
to come

492
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,240
back from being in flower because um

493
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,038
you know that is a way to

494
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,319
essentially kind of clean stuff up yeah

495
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,558
yeah

496
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,159
baby and pamper something that may

497
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,119
otherwise be

498
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,679
uh

499
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,599
kind of jeopardized or whatever yeah

500
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,120
interesting can't wait to try that

501
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,759
actually

502
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,759
yeah no it and really like all it is

503
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,440
the essence of tissue culture

504
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,120
is starting with something that's so

505
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,160
you know like the only thing that's

506
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,678
alive

507
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,038
inside the

508
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,798
the little

509
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:03,440
petri dish kind of

510
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:05,279
environment is the the cannabis plant

511
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,240
no

512
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,879
no powdery mildew no

513
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,720
um funguses no

514
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,400
obviously no

515
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,279
insects no

516
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,240
uh

517
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:22,399
hopefully no pathogens even though

518
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,359
viruses and things can live inside

519
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,200
tissue but so what you do is you start

520
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,279
by taking it

521
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,240
a little tiny cutting

522
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,119
and

523
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,120
first we rinse it in

524
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,319
in soapy water essentially just like a

525
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:41,199
detergent so you can use anything like

526
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:44,079
like dawn for example and

527
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,558
we'll shake all of the little cuttings

528
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,519
inside a

529
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,918
mason jar essentially of detergent

530
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,160
and then the next step

531
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,400
is uh pull them out

532
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,160
kind of dry them off shake them off even

533
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,519
rinse them if you want and then we put

534
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,279
it into a

535
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,319
a second bath that's a chlorine bath and

536
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,319
so

537
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,319
we'll just completely

538
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,399
wipe out anything

539
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,279
that um

540
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
might you know sort of challenge the the

541
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,279
rooting

542
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,679
and the continued growth of the plant

543
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,558
and then we'll just go instead of going

544
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,840
totally into the tissue culture media

545
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,000
we'll

546
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,879
into a classic

547
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,839
clone scenario but just keep it a lot

548
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,120
more

549
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,439
uh

550
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,639
airtight and a lot more

551
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,880
you know isolated a lot more that's cool

552
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,400
use rooting hormone and and that's been

553
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,880
an amazing

554
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,320
trick it's kind of like a hybrid tissue

555
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,480
culture in a way

556
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,480
but

557
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,079
when when we're trying to get something

558
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,558
to go from

559
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,359
full full flower

560
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,519
and

561
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,319
save it and keep

562
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,400
you know preserve the genetic

563
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,480
get it back into veg

564
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,559
we found that that can be helpful

565
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,079
especially you know if if it's something

566
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,759
that you find uh and it's outdoor for

567
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,879
example there's

568
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:15,038
you know just more like potential for

569
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,240
yeasts and molds and things like that

570
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,119
yeah yeah

571
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,079
and you can't dig the plant up and put

572
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,158
it back under 24 hour light so

573
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,839
it can be easier if if you're doing it

574
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,760
if you're happening

575
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,038
if you're growing in a pot a lot of

576
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,079
people will just be like oh well i'm

577
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,599
just gonna

578
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,720
take the pot

579
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,199
and

580
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,919
bring the plant back into the

581
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,159
you know the bedroom and

582
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,480
you know a month and a half later

583
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,559
there's little sprouts coming out that

584
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,279
are our veg

585
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:50,158
but you know when you're doing this in a

586
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,480
big field kind of environment you can't

587
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,320
really do that yeah but

588
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,679
you know the advantages of the big field

589
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,279
is that you can

590
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,759
pick the one

591
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,279
out of 10 000

592
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,558
because you have

593
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,158
that many more to look at uh

594
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,319
so you know there's advantages and

595
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,159
disadvantages to all of it but

596
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,720
that's how farmer's daughter came about

597
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,919
and it's it was a

598
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,600
it came out of a humble pound cake and

599
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,038
then

600
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,038
it's always interesting cause people are

601
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:21,839
always of course the first question is

602
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,319
like

603
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,199
what's the cross

604
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,439
and

605
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,400
for us a lot of the time we're never

606
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,240
like releasing a genetic that's just

607
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,280
a times b

608
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,000
equals

609
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,558
this litter of mutts we're we're

610
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,359
actually trying to make uh

611
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,960
a

612
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,319
a line you know

613
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,200
your stabilized strain a real strain and

614
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:50,960
and in seed form that involves

615
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,200
many many um iterations of

616
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,840
of back crossing and

617
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,120
sort of stabilizing and

618
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:01,519
in that process

619
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,918
you know it may have started

620
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,319
five years ago by just crossing two

621
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,240
random things but

622
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,079
a lot of the time what it ends up being

623
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,400
for us is like

624
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:16,798
you know m 69 crossed with

625
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,759
m 27

626
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:22,000
then the next year we chose

627
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,000
uh

628
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,880
you know g number three and crosstalk

629
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,679
with

630
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,360
x number four

631
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,240
like none of them ended up being uh

632
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,000
strains because in as in and of

633
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,359
themselves they were just individuals

634
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,359
that were selected right and

635
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,839
but

636
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,839
but it at the end of the day it it makes

637
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,359
something and it's sort of hard to like

638
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,240
reference back

639
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,038
um

640
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,240
what that was but yeah

641
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:58,400
yeah so pound cake and

642
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,759
um

643
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,840
i think

644
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,679
the vanilla cream pie was those were

645
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,439
sort of like

646
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,038
basically offshoots of of that

647
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,400
when you're developing something too

648
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,960
you're gonna

649
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
you know you kind of like set a goal

650
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,000
that

651
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,678
let's just say you know go back in time

652
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,839
um

653
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,919
15 years when we were

654
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:28,480
developing blueberry muffin

655
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,480
or 12 years or whatever it was and um

656
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,400
you know at some point

657
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:37,279
there may have been like before it's

658
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,038
entirely stable and everything

659
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,240
it smells exactly like a blueberry

660
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,319
muffin

661
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,880
there could be one that you're just like

662
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,918
oh my god that smells like

663
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,080
apple pie and

664
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,679
and then all of a sudden like you know

665
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,439
that may be

666
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,880
bbm

667
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
number

668
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,760
36

669
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,079
and and

670
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:05,919
so you move bbm 36 into a new

671
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:08,319
lineage and a new new category no and

672
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,120
you're like okay i love this

673
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:14,639
individual so much that

674
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,479
i'm now gonna start to move it into like

675
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,159
a new

676
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,159
you know a whole new genetic or a whole

677
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,278
new strain and

678
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,960
and that's

679
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,798
you know perfectly

680
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,798
normal and and fair um

681
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,879
and you know you so you then of course

682
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,200
someone's gonna be like well what's

683
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,039
what's the cross on apple pie and you're

684
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,679
just sitting there thinking like i mean

685
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,599
it's not even really a cross because

686
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,720
you know it was just a fino yeah it's

687
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,959
just a variant of the of the cultivar or

688
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,519
it's a very good yeah that's a good way

689
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,440
of putting it um

690
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,440
but i think you know so many

691
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:56,720
cannabis breeders are at this stage

692
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,679
where they're just like

693
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,919
you know

694
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,000
they don't have the room to like look at

695
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,278
this stuff at a grand scale so they

696
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,558
don't have

697
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,599
you know

698
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,558
acres to be able to devote to having

699
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,558
breeding

700
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:14,879
chambers and fields to to run things and

701
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,200
and they don't uh

702
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,760
you know a lot of it's happening

703
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,440
indoors so you see a lot of like

704
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,558
all right well if you're doing breeding

705
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,720
indoor

706
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,960
there the chances of pollen conden

707
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,440
contamination from one

708
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,880
area to another are actually much higher

709
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,440
because you've got

710
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,278
like hvac yeah and

711
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,600
you know like literally

712
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:37,599
i've

713
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,120
i've bred indoor plenty and

714
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,679
you you got to go in there every time

715
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:48,399
you change to the next thing you have to

716
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,720
go in with like uh

717
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,919
um pressure washer and like

718
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,480
get the corners and just it's crazy

719
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,759
because the pollen actually sticks

720
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,839
everywhere

721
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,119
it lives longer and it'll stay in the

722
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,720
vents and the heating pumps and stuff

723
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,599
and you know you'll go and you'll be

724
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,240
like

725
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,879
there's no way like the only source of

726
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,599
pollen that i could have you'd like see

727
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,600
a couple seeds in your next batch

728
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,639
and you're like the only pollen that was

729
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,959
ever in here it was six months ago but

730
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,120
it'll actually stay

731
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,440
um so it

732
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,319
and amazingly enough it when you're

733
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,919
outside and you've got nature's sort of

734
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,319
pressure of

735
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,278
of wind and and

736
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:37,359
dew and all these you know heavy duty

737
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,000
sunlight and stuff like that

738
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,359
um it's a lot less likely that you're

739
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
going to have

740
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,399
you know like there's no way no

741
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,440
lingering pollen yeah no pollen is left

742
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,120
yeah

743
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,278
at the at the farm right now you know

744
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,959
aren't sure but um

745
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,000
so we have a

746
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,880
you know

747
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,400
but when we do breed indoors uh

748
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,400
[Music]

749
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,440
oh you know so i guess i was just saying

750
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,600
like

751
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,640
so what you see a lot of

752
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,199
with

753
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,159
a lot of seed companies is just

754
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,400
you know like one you'll take

755
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,960
you know oh the white runs is really

756
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,080
popular so i'm just gonna take the white

757
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,278
runs and i'm going to

758
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,519
have it

759
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,079
pollinate this room and i'm going to put

760
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,759
30 different strains in there

761
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,720
and just

762
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,599
you know

763
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,079
that's

764
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,079
basically your seed line for the year is

765
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,038
white runts times girl scout white runs

766
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,000
time

767
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,679
gelato white runs styles oh gee white

768
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,759
runs times

769
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,480
blueberry muffin and

770
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,960
and that's cool if if your customers

771
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,440
just want to like really have a pheno

772
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,399
hunt if they want to

773
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,440
look you know if they're trying to grow

774
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,798
something that's going to basically have

775
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,200
you know

776
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,000
a litter of mutts yeah

777
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,360
but the reality is mutts are great dogs

778
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,839
um

779
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,839
but you know our goal is to

780
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,558
get purebred lines and then do true

781
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,519
hybrid breeding

782
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:21,839
but

783
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,200
i have to admit it's it's not

784
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,199
easy and

785
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,159
even though we're like putting a bunch

786
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,720
of

787
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,720
energy and effort towards it

788
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,679
it's uh

789
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,798
cannabis isn't is a

790
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,679
keeps you on your toes yeah it sure does

791
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,440
um

792
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,600
is there a difference between the choice

793
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,278
of strains commercial growers are asking

794
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,719
for is compared to like

795
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,240
small medical people like myself

796
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,440
yeah i mean i don't want to say that

797
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,000
there's

798
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,720
necessarily like a difference so we

799
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,079
can't be like here's

800
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,558
um

801
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,278
i mean we actually do

802
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,278
have uh

803
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,558
kind of like a

804
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,000
a sub

805
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:12,879
set of of our genetics that were

806
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,880
that we endorse for commercial people

807
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,480
much more than

808
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,440
just let's just say the whole catalog so

809
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,440
yeah

810
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,320
you know this time of year

811
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,798
you know every day

812
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,119
we're doing what we call genetic

813
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,879
consultations with

814
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,079
farms and

815
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,360
and uh

816
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,720
you know across

817
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,719
california and

818
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,278
definitely

819
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,200
you know almost every conversation

820
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,119
involves

821
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,798
having to be like

822
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,759
oh you know i don't know if you want to

823
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:49,440
grow

824
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,879
something like

825
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,360
and and i don't want to throw these

826
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,240
strains under the bus because they're

827
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,439
awesome in their own right but

828
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,640
you know i don't know if you want to

829
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,759
grow

830
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,679
uh

831
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,319
train wreck or

832
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,159
jack herrer or

833
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,480
um

834
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,960
blue dream kind of stuff

835
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,079
because it's just really hard to sell

836
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,079
anything or like even our old strains

837
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,558
that we created like

838
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,798
like ppd and

839
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:20,798
uh

840
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,240
i don't know it

841
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,240
it just depends but but it's really so

842
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,519
based on

843
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,798
thc

844
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,798
what like what dispensaries will buy and

845
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,398
unless you have

846
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,278
your own brand

847
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:42,079
and and unless your brand

848
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,278
specifically speaks to people

849
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,278
that are

850
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:46,798
above the whole

851
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,398
thc

852
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:51,839
you know that are smarter than

853
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,079
than

854
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,879
the general population in that they

855
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:59,199
don't just go into the store and say

856
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,880
what strain has the highest thc that's

857
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,640
what i want to buy

858
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,840
so if you have a brand that

859
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,159
that's doing education and kind of

860
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,158
you know

861
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,439
has your

862
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,398
your

863
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,600
differentiation is that your brand has

864
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,199
like really unique turpins or

865
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,879
you know like and and our blueberry

866
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,399
muffin is a perfect example of it

867
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,440
because

868
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:29,599
anybody who has ever experienced it

869
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,880
knows that it's just this incredibly

870
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,119
pleasant

871
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,919
high and

872
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:38,719
like a wonderful thing to grow it smells

873
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,200
amazing you know oh yeah i have my

874
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,440
freezer is full of bags of

875
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,600
you know various grades and sizes of

876
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,278
your the blueberry muffin

877
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,359
yeah and you show your friends and

878
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,599
they're just like oh my god that smells

879
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,918
you know it's seductive it's like

880
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,959
it was also the densest bud i've ever

881
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,480
grown

882
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
ever they're like

883
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,679
rocks

884
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,199
it's super easy to grow

885
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,320
and so

886
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,880
there's there are those ones that

887
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:09,038
and dispensaries ironically

888
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,760
will tell you that like

889
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,960
all anybody wants to buy is really high

890
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,879
thc

891
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,360
except there are a few things that they

892
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,960
go and ask you know some a lot of people

893
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,918
go in and they're like

894
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,000
you know

895
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,360
well i don't care what the thc is just

896
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,278
give me that blueberry muffin that's

897
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,918
what i want

898
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,839
and so there's some things like that

899
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,720
that will but aside from that

900
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:35,038
unfortunately we have to tell people

901
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,000
um because we care

902
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,879
a lot about our community and we

903
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,240
know

904
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,600
like the times are really really tough

905
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,519
right now in california because

906
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,599
you know i don't want to totally blame

907
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,919
it on on

908
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,038
the way that the

909
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,480
new

910
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,480
law has been applied but

911
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,158
there's an

912
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:04,398
oversupply of cannabis and it's

913
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,440
very hard for

914
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:10,479
some of the you know original small

915
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,679
family farms to survive and yeah we're

916
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,278
going to talk about that in a few

917
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,159
minutes here but

918
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:15,359
um

919
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,519
let me ask you

920
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,959
one or two more questions about

921
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,919
the amazing air

922
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,360
um

923
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,440
if you had if you were like

924
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,119
stuck on a desert island what three of

925
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,679
your strains would you want to have some

926
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,678
buds of

927
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,678
i wouldn't want to have buds i'd want to

928
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,679
have seeds

929
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,399
that's as long as

930
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,399
seeds in them okay

931
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,399
um i'd probably bring

932
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,839
seeds of

933
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,839
uh blueberry muffin

934
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,519
you know to be honest i might bring some

935
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,679
trainwreck seeds

936
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,919
or maybe even freak show

937
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,919
um

938
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,398
just because it's like this to fool the

939
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,398
natives

940
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,398
it's this kind of an uplifting like i'd

941
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,480
really like to pinolin high

942
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,279
the eye that you get from that kind of

943
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,159
tropinolim train wreck smell

944
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,919
but

945
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,599
i would definitely bring something that

946
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,838
was just like a

947
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,039
super high

948
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:24,480
octane gas you know so

949
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,000
something that would

950
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,119
something that would knock me out help

951
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
me sleep

952
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,838
be real ethereal kind of like a pain

953
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,559
so you know along those lines it might

954
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,440
be an og bush it might be

955
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,519
uh

956
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,358
headband a humboldt headband it might be

957
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,000
um

958
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,838
the all gas og and then

959
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,559
like i said the blueberry muffin and

960
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,918
then the uh

961
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,639
shootout maybe i would bring some

962
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,158
autoflower too because i want to have

963
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,838
i'd want to have

964
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,640
weed like

965
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,000
every fresh weed every month yeah i'm

966
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,279
gonna have to try some of those by the

967
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,920
way

968
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,070
either that or else i'd build like a

969
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,240
palm light depth out of palm

970
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,200
[Laughter]

971
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,919
um

972
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,279
you know i i follow your instagram page

973
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,720
and um

974
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,200
i get excited

975
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:22,239
i got really excited i saw you had gone

976
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,639
down to columbia is that right so

977
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,159
and i know you have other

978
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,000
countries you've been to so are there

979
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,838
any land race cultivars you've been able

980
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,800
to find that you've stabilized that

981
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:36,239
compare favorably with established

982
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,800
strains here in california

983
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,799
um and we did we

984
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,839
you know and and ben was the one who was

985
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,119
down in colombia most recently and

986
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:50,239
jamaica i was down in jamaica

987
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,079
uh a couple years ago

988
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,639
we did you know of course everybody

989
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,440
always talks about the the lamb spread

990
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,639
in jamaica and

991
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,480
um

992
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,279
so we kind of went out on a

993
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,880
on a mission to find that

994
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,560
and

995
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,920
the cool thing about them is that

996
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:11,838
there's like

997
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,720
there are definitely a lot of

998
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,719
unexplored

999
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,440
uh amazing qualities to be found in

1000
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,800
those

1001
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,400
varieties

1002
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,800
and

1003
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,680
the unfortunate thing about them

1004
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,800
is you know they often test

1005
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,199
at like

1006
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,079
between 10 and 15

1007
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,039
yeah

1008
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,280
so

1009
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,199
you know you bring them back and

1010
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,880
sometimes you know we want to hybridize

1011
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,039
them and

1012
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,680
we did that a little bit with the the

1013
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,960
lamb spread and a friend of mine

1014
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,199
um

1015
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,559
at full moon farms

1016
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:51,439
actually has

1017
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,960
kind of found a really cool

1018
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,639
cross that

1019
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,679
i think came from something that we

1020
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:59,519
initially crossed and then he

1021
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,118
you know really

1022
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,280
sifted through the

1023
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,880
the population but full moon is in

1024
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,839
jamaica

1025
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,720
no full moon is actually

1026
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:10,400
humboldt

1027
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,078
right halle that's

1028
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,920
that's it right

1029
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,880
full moon farms

1030
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,119
nick

1031
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,119

1032
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:23,799
it's like full moon 707 is the instagram

1033
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,800
handle i believe

1034
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,240
he's he's really cool and he's been

1035
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:32,078
working on that for a while

1036
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:33,358
so you know give him credit um

1037
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,560
but

1038
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:39,039
it's a challenge because you know for

1039
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:42,480
one thing there's like the

1040
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,320
idea of keeping the land race totally

1041
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,039
pure which we

1042
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,880
we definitely did that with the uh

1043
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,000
the lamb spread we were like we're not

1044
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,920
gonna um

1045
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,320
just focus on

1046
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,320
on out breeding we're gonna

1047
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,960
continue to keep it

1048
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,320
pure and stable and so

1049
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,480
you know the

1050
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,280
the work involved with that is like

1051
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,760
busting it out every four years and

1052
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,200
and making sure that you know it's

1053
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,400
either that or putting it in like

1054
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,358
cryogenic storage which is possible you

1055
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,838
know

1056
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,400
um

1057
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:20,639
but

1058
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,960
uh

1059
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,759
one sleep once weed is not

1060
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,920
ridiculously expensive to grow

1061
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,400
in a

1062
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,559
you know in a license i think that there

1063
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,160
will be

1064
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:35,199
cool

1065
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,598
breeding

1066
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,439
groups that are just like you know we're

1067
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,359
gonna keep

1068
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,320
propagating

1069
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,078
um

1070
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,960
heritage strains from different places

1071
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,880
and

1072
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,480
and just kind of keep

1073
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,640
you know because it's not it's not

1074
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,639
expensive to do

1075
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,598
and it's it's a little bit of a labor of

1076
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,920
love and i think people would want to

1077
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,039
to grow those i mean a lot of people ask

1078
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,159
us for some of those land race um

1079
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:08,000
like for example those land race uh

1080
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,559
lamb spread seeds

1081
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
we also have lambs land race

1082
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,400
ethiopian seeds

1083
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,679
from the blue nile river

1084
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,358
we have land race colombian seeds that

1085
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,078
ben picked up

1086
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,319
when he was down there we have

1087
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,240
some land race do you know where in

1088
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,240
colombia he was um

1089
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,680
the

1090
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:37,358
sierra mod or the

1091
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:39,039
sierra nevada actually was a place that

1092
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,358
i think that

1093
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:45,599
he had found some seeds actually

1094
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,799
i know that that sounds like

1095
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,440
it's a california but there's also

1096
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,800
a mountain range in colombia yeah yeah

1097
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,159
yeah

1098
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,880
um yeah you remember santa marta gold i

1099
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,759
remember yeah completely red colombian

1100
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,920
black brown green

1101
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,920
but you know that the crazy thing is

1102
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,400
like if you look back

1103
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,480
i think on our youtube or on our

1104
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,920
instagram either one

1105
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,719
you'll see we have

1106
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,000
we made a little

1107
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,799
video

1108
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,838
of our adventures in jamaica

1109
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,880
and uh

1110
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,358
very cool

1111
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,318
it's just crazy because you go there and

1112
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,440
i mean one of the saddest things is

1113
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:29,039
that

1114
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,880
we went around and we were immediately

1115
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:35,599
like talking to you know the oldest

1116
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,200
rosters that we could find and

1117
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,079
and

1118
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,159
we'll learn very quickly that you know

1119
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,839
unfortunately

1120
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,519
western culture

1121
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,838
had

1122
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,920
gotten its

1123
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:54,719
you know un like

1124
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,559
spoiled a lot of of the real rootsy

1125
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,959
culture that had developed around

1126
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,519
jamaican ganja by bringing seeds in they

1127
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,400
weren't jamaican

1128
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:06,800
yeah and just by like you know popular

1129
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,960
culture being like i mean because we

1130
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,318
would go around and we'd

1131
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,880
ask a group of of roster growers and and

1132
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:17,759
we weren't just like i was driving

1133
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,880
around the island with bob marley's

1134
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,520
uh

1135
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,599
nephew nephew-in-law for example who

1136
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,679
who was born and raised and knew

1137
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,000
everybody there and

1138
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,799
and so it wasn't like

1139
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
some random white guy from california

1140
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,519
yeah

1141
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,239
and

1142
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,280
and we'd ask that the guys like you know

1143
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,239
where's

1144
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,240
all the good original jamaican seeds at

1145
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:43,838
and they'd be like oh yeah

1146
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:45,919
um

1147
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:49,199
we'll be right back we got og cush seeds

1148
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,920
we'll give you

1149
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,838
we got sour diesel seeds

1150
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,280
did you ever come across somebody

1151
00:41:53,838 --> 00:42:00,078
mentioning a strain called the cotton

1152
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,680
i do feel like we did because um shia

1153
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,920
kor uh

1154
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,159
cat corey son of third world

1155
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,000
he plays for damian marley's damien

1156
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,480
marley's bass player but uh we were

1157
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,800
having a conversation he goes yeah bob

1158
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,358
bob's favorite strain was something

1159
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,039
called the cotton

1160
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,519
yeah i definitely

1161
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,318
heard about this down there

1162
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,318
and

1163
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,719
i think what people have to remember and

1164
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:25,759
realize is it's like

1165
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,759
you know

1166
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,839
the concept of

1167
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,800
strain especially when you're talking

1168
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:34,719
about

1169
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,000
you know stuff that's propagated by seed

1170
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,838
it's just

1171
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,159
there's such a vast

1172
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:41,199
yeah potential interpretation you know

1173
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,399
like

1174
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,159
we're like

1175
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,280
all right well we're not going to call

1176
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:50,318
something a seed like a strain until

1177
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,359
we've at least inbred and back crossed

1178
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,599
like

1179
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,440
two or three generations

1180
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,838
after pheno hunting

1181
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,440
and finding a

1182
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:01,039
unique um

1183
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,159
whereas

1184
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:06,960
you know

1185
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:08,318
99 of what will we see is just like oh

1186
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,599
you know i took

1187
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,358
these two random clones that i had and

1188
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,200
cross them and

1189
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,159
and i'm just going to call that a strain

1190
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:20,480
and it's like so then but what happens

1191
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,799
is then there's like you have

1192
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,880
30 different things that come out of

1193
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,720
that that are all

1194
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,800
really like

1195
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:31,279
everybody who buys those seeds is just

1196
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,318
going to call them all the strange

1197
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,920
whatever screen it is and so

1198
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:39,039
you could have a million different

1199
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,280
iterations of of something and

1200
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,400
and uh

1201
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,920
it might

1202
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,440
they may not be alike at all and so you

1203
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,280
know and it depends like how you

1204
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,559
describe it like if you say that it

1205
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,040
smells like

1206
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:56,559
um bananas and

1207
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,318
and as that's the strain name um and one

1208
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,679
of them doesn't smell at all like

1209
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:01,599
bananas

1210
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,399
then that one may

1211
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,760
not end up being called

1212
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,920
banana kush or whatever it is which that

1213
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,000
helps a little bit and i think that's

1214
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,280
why so many people

1215
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,719
um

1216
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,359
you know use

1217
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,078
the food references and the food names

1218
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:21,039
in

1219
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,280
in naming strains because

1220
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,838
it kind of just helps you give like a

1221
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,430
defining a reference yeah yeah exactly

1222
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,119
yeah

1223
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:31,440
[Music]

1224
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,318
i noticed that thailand

1225
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,318
had

1226
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:36,000
become the first country in southeast

1227
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:38,079
asia to make

1228
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,039
cannabis legal in some kind of fashion

1229
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,318
and they're

1230
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,759
shooting for recreational but

1231
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:45,679
for me

1232
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,079
you know when i started smoking i only

1233
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:52,159
smoked land race either bud or hash and

1234
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,318
when when finally

1235
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,480
like ty weed came around

1236
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,400
in the late 70s

1237
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,358
um

1238
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,000
it was perhaps the most developed of all

1239
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:05,358
the land race strains in that it was it

1240
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,280
was the first

1241
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:10,159
you'd get that was seedless first of all

1242
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,640
and it was on sticks and they were also

1243
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,239
amazingly spicy and strong

1244
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,239
it was probably the strongest weed that

1245
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:18,000
i'd ever had

1246
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,838
but it sure would be nice to get some of

1247
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,920
that

1248
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,279
i don't know if it still exists you know

1249
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,838
what i mean

1250
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,640
yeah though

1251
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:28,318
we

1252
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,639
we had some thai

1253
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,199
i mean there were definitely

1254
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,199
you know and and you never know for sure

1255
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,279
unless you go and

1256
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,719
pluck it from

1257
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,519
from a field in thailand yourself but

1258
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:46,480
there were definitely thai

1259
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,960
varieties that that were passed around

1260
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,719
and and we experimented with them

1261
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,800
and

1262
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,000
they were actually really awesome a lot

1263
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,359
of them were

1264
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,559
very

1265
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,000
frosty

1266
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:59,838
uh

1267
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,079
and that was something that stood out

1268
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:02,960
for me about the thai varieties is that

1269
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,400
they were

1270
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,519
kind of like

1271
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,160
reminiscent of of uh

1272
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,759
some kind of like a haze variety where

1273
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:14,000
the buds were

1274
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,599
they weren't super dense or anything

1275
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,719
like that but

1276
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,838
but it was incredibly frosty and

1277
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:21,118
yeah

1278
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,880
several of them

1279
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,760
went really late

1280
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,920
uh

1281
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,119
so yeah they grow really long

1282
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,920
yeah really

1283
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,640
almost a sativa type thing

1284
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,680
oh definitely yeah i would say sativa

1285
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:34,799
and

1286
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,318
and

1287
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:41,039
good for that more equatorial type

1288
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:42,559
tropical climate because

1289
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,159
you know

1290
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,318
when you have

1291
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:46,318
the

1292
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:52,078
quicker flowering varieties they just

1293
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,079
don't even have a chance to really grow

1294
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,400
very much before

1295
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:00,079
they're ready to flower and then yeah

1296
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,480
yeah yeah especially when on 12 12 hours

1297
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,000
of sunlight 12 hours of darkness year

1298
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,679
round

1299
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,079
at the equator

1300
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,118
it's it's definitely a whole nother

1301
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,440
yeah

1302
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:15,358
the first plants i ever grew were some

1303
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,200
humble or excuse me um big sur holy weed

1304
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,199
and

1305
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,078
thai seeds that we had from the thai

1306
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,039
weed

1307
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,079
and

1308
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:26,239
the thai finished in january whereas the

1309
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,280
big sur holy weed was done in october

1310
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:28,959
you know it was

1311
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,760
it was wow

1312
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,400
so

1313
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,119
those thai varieties are awesome and

1314
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:39,200
we tested them i remember we did do some

1315
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:41,119
thc testing on it and

1316
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,159
it was crazy because like a lot of those

1317
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,800
things

1318
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,159
did they won't come up

1319
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,559
high for

1320
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:50,719
for thc but

1321
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,760
as far as like getting you stoned and

1322
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:55,759
how hard pitching everything i mean it

1323
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,800
was just like

1324
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,400
you know

1325
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,440
a lot of them were just incredibly stony

1326
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,599
and

1327
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,880
i mean there's so much that's yet to be

1328
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,200
and

1329
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,440
unfortunately we're

1330
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,000
human nature wants to

1331
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,838
have things spelled out

1332
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,440
you know we want to like

1333
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,440
understand

1334
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,679
stuff um

1335
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,838
before we

1336
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:27,679
can really believe our own instincts

1337
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:30,000
so

1338
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,440
you know one thing that i've noticed is

1339
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,838
if you

1340
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,720
take a

1341
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,279
rich

1342
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,118
variety and

1343
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,559
uh mix it with a

1344
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,200
thc

1345
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,680
heavy variety and and roll a joint of it

1346
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,118
like you may be getting

1347
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,838
less

1348
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:53,200
overall thc than if you had just rolled

1349
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:55,838
the joint out of all thc but

1350
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:57,519
but um

1351
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:58,639
it gets you

1352
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:59,920
it just like

1353
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,440
totally

1354
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,599
gets you blitzed yeah entourage effect

1355
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,318
yeah it's it's crazy and it's it's

1356
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,440
almost like i didn't really it's not

1357
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,480
something that i

1358
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,079
wanted to do very often because

1359
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,318
it would

1360
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,599
like if i wanted

1361
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,838
to seriously to just get you know

1362
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,440
take a few puffs and just go

1363
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:24,799
straight to bed

1364
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,920
go to sleep

1365
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,440
um feel no pain kind of situation that's

1366
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,920
that would be

1367
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,000
what i would probably do and and you

1368
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,599
know these days actually the older i get

1369
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,519
the more i think about that i'm like

1370
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,760
well maybe i should just have my

1371
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:43,440
nightly ritual and

1372
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,200
and smoke some cbd and some thc and just

1373
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,519
get zonkered

1374
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:48,399
but uh i have a friend that recommends

1375
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,920
that

1376
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,519
yeah that's what i

1377
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,200
that's how it affects me and i don't

1378
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:54,318
know it could affect other people

1379
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,199
differently

1380
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:57,759
but

1381
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,480
i mean one thing i just know for sure

1382
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,920
without a doubt is that

1383
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,719
we know

1384
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,358
maybe

1385
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:07,519
five percent of all there is to know

1386
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:08,558
about cannabis

1387
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:11,199
via

1388
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,200
lab testing and

1389
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,039
our bodies know everything it needs to

1390
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:16,639
know about it

1391
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,440
just by

1392
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:19,118
uh

1393
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,480
experience and

1394
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,280
you know

1395
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,719
but experimenting and you know we always

1396
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,240
encourage people to

1397
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,039
to

1398
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,199
experiment slowly and cautiously like

1399
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,159
don't get super stoned

1400
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,318
especially if you have any

1401
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,759
responsibilities but

1402
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:37,519
uh

1403
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,200
i don't know like that

1404
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:43,039
worst thing that happened to me with one

1405

it's an interesting place it's beautiful

1443
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:11,838
i fell in love with the culture

1444
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:16,240
um

1445
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,239
so well let's go on to part two here

1446
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:22,078
uh so humboldt seed company was a

1447
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,919
sponsor at the emerald cup just last

1448
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,880

1449
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,960
is that right yeah and

1450
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,880
you know did you notice then signs of

1451
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,880
farmers being affected by the current

1452
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,318
taxes and the price crash of cannabis

1453
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,838
yeah that was

1454
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:39,838
i mean it sort of started

1455
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,040
in

1456
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,639
what would you say hallie like it

1457
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,039
started in

1458
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,879
july or june or july when we started

1459
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,400
seeing

1460
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,480
prices just

1461
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,838
yeah tank out i mean like a little bit

1462
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,480
before that

1463
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:59,119
before it was slow it was like happening

1464
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,639
slowly and then it just like dropped

1465
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,480
hard

1466
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:03,759
yeah so i mean

1467
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,440
that's your daughter

1468
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,160

1469
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,280

1470
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:15,078
we're at work too hi hallie i'm vince

1471
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,079
some people call me cenzo

1472
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,199
but

1473
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,519
you know i think there we've all seen

1474
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,079
these like

1475
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:30,079
pits and peaks and valley or you know

1476
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,599
whatever you want to call it of the

1477
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:36,480
prices of cannabis

1478
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,920
especially in the last 10 years

1479
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,519
and we

1480
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,039
have seen it

1481
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:46,079
go as low as like 500 a pound before

1482
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,318
in california and then

1483
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,318
uh

1484
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,240
a year later it was

1485
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:57,440
1400 a pound and um

1486
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,479
and we're talking about outdoor red

1487
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,200
uh

1488
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,159
for whatever reason indoor tends to

1489
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:06,960
fetch a higher price i think you know

1490
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:09,519
the data shows that it's really just

1491
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,280
based on looks because there's no

1492
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,920
there's no

1493
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,599
higher turpin or higher thc it's just

1494
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,960
like yeah it's different

1495
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,640
but um

1496
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,280
and obviously it costs a lot more to

1497
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:22,719
produce indoor flower but

1498
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,079
um

1499
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,078
in any case the uh

1500
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,279
the rebound that we saw in like 2019

1501
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,240
2020

1502
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,440
like the spring of 2020 fall of 2019

1503
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,639
where it went back up to 1400

1504
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,639
um

1505
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,078
that was encouraging for a lot of us

1506
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,159
because we were all

1507
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,280
sort of expecting

1508
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,199
the

1509
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,720
the new

1510
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:53,519
um paradigm of growing in california

1511
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:55,919
with recreational cannabis to

1512
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:58,559
to have an effect on prices and

1513
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,318
everything like that and

1514
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,240
i mean unfortunately it doesn't really

1515
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,599
seem to translate

1516
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:06,479
some people that are

1517
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:09,760
listening might you know go and get

1518
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,798
their cannabis at dispensaries and

1519
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,799
uh

1520
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:15,119
the bummer is is that

1521
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:17,039
when the prices drop for farmers they

1522
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,240
don't really seem to

1523
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,639
get

1524
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,039
cheaper at the dispenser it doesn't

1525
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,719
translate to the buyer it almost never

1526
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,960
does and i don't know why the heck well

1527
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,519
i do know why that is but you know the

1528
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,639
the way that california made the thing

1529
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,719
there's so many links in the chain that

1530
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:37,519
and each link is a business so you've

1531
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:40,959
got distributors and people that are

1532
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:43,920
doing packaging and and processing and

1533
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,760
and then finally dispensaries and and of

1534
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,200
course the labs too and

1535
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,359
all of those companies

1536
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,118
have to turn a profit or else they're

1537
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,078
not a company anymore

1538
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,798
and

1539
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,640
so just you know imagine

1540
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:02,159
each one of them

1541
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:03,440
just chipping away at the overall you

1542
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:05,838
know

1543
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,720
value of the cannabis

1544
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:08,719
and then um

1545
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:16,639
so then

1546
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,318
basically the farmer is the one that's

1547
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,440
sort of like

1548
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:21,039
you know

1549
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,318
it's the

1550
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,000
for whatever reason that

1551
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:28,159
you would think that farmers might be

1552
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,079
able to get together and and fix the

1553
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:33,358
price and be like you know we're not

1554
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:36,240
really going any lower than 500 because

1555
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,519
when you go any lower than 500 you're

1556
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:41,439
probably

1557
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:43,358
about just about losing money as a farm

1558
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,599
but um

1559
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,358
the the problem is is that there

1560
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,680
even if we tried that it just wouldn't

1561
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:52,400
last for one thing it's not legal

1562
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:54,239
there are laws against price fixing yeah

1563
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,838
yeah and then

1564
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:59,679
not specific to cannabis but specific to

1565
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:00,798
agriculture and then for another thing

1566
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:02,798
there

1567
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:04,960
um is always just going to kind of be

1568
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:07,599
like that

1569
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,119
scab i guess you know like yeah

1570
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,559
the person that's going to cross the

1571
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,798
picket line and and go back to work even

1572
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,798
though the prices are not you know

1573
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,639
there's not a living wage

1574
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,400
and and i don't blame some you know

1575
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,759
those people it's not really their fault

1576
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,599
it's just like

1577
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:30,480
it's a product of what we've created

1578
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:31,680
as our society and and a product of

1579
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,798
you know

1580
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:37,759
the the laws not really

1581
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:41,920
looking out or benefiting the

1582
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:44,880
small business small family farm

1583
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:47,119
which you know is is nothing new in the

1584
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,440
united states and

1585
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,318
yeah of course

1586
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,880
that

1587
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:54,798
we'll see how it i think there's like

1588
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,680
some kind of a hope that

1589
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:59,759
the massive consolidation of wealth

1590
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,558
that's happening is just gonna somehow

1591
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,640
resolve itself in this country

1592
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,640
um i don't think so

1593
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:09,440
or you know there's gonna have to be

1594
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:11,118
some kind of an intervention because

1595
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,358
you know clearly

1596
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,880
um if we keep going on the same

1597
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:16,480
trajectory

1598
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,680
uh

1599
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,000
there's gonna be

1600
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:22,639
you know 10 or 15 people that own

1601
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,079
everything in the world and the rest of

1602
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,239
us are going to

1603
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,039
you know essentially live to serve them

1604
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:31,519
in some respect

1605
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,519
and uh

1606
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:37,199
power in what do they say absolute power

1607
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:39,759
corrupts absolutely perhaps absolutely

1608
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:42,159
so it's just yeah or just some like

1609
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,079
facts that that would say that this

1610
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:46,399
isn't going to just be able to work like

1611
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:48,559
this forever so i don't know like

1612
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,240
was it like that guy robert reich he has

1613
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,640
that movie that came out he calls it

1614
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,598
fixing capitalism

1615
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,480
saving capitalism i like robert

1616
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,559
and

1617
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,119
and i kind of like that because i'm not

1618
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:06,240
you know as i've gotten older i'm maybe

1619
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,240
a little bit less of a radical but uh

1620
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:10,239
i do believe in some of the principles

1621
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,000
of capitalism but there are some things

1622
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:13,118
that are just like

1623
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,400
you know

1624
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:17,119
planned

1625
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,680
obsolescence of it almost like we yeah

1626
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:22,720
continue anyway in california there were

1627
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,159
supposed to be we all voted on this

1628
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:25,279
legalization

1629
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:26,159
template

1630
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,599
that

1631
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:32,960
probably one of the biggest

1632
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:35,200
rallying points around it was this like

1633
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,318
five-year period of time

1634
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:38,798
where

1635
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,400
the existing cannabis people

1636
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:42,239
the people that were doing the medical

1637
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,480
stuff the people

1638
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:46,879
you know that were farming

1639
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,440
in these rural

1640
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,039
areas that are kind of like the napa of

1641
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,200
cannabis

1642
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,199
so on and so forth those

1643
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:56,159
folks would

1644
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:58,239
be

1645
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,759
they would essentially not allow more

1646
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:02,959
than an acre

1647
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,880
to be grown under any one business

1648
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,318
uh

1649
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,559
to allow

1650
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:09,679
companies

1651
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,359
that

1652
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:14,239
you know to

1653
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:16,239
bolster their infrastructure

1654
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,959
to be able to then

1655
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,039
be

1656
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,920
in competition with

1657
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:25,039
um bigger more

1658
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,200
capitalized corporate you know investor

1659
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,798
venture capital types

1660
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:30,078
and uh

1661
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:31,838
because it was obvious that they were

1662
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,798
coming and

1663
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:35,838
you know

1664
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:37,759
why not why wouldn't they yeah

1665
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:40,318
it's a potential moneymaker so they're

1666
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,359
gonna give it a shot and

1667
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,798
but then

1668
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:46,798
that rule just vanished and

1669
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:49,358
overnight after

1670
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,400
we you know i personally actually did

1671
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,639
not

1672
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,559
vote on it which was really weird for me

1673
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,798
i voted yes the first time are we

1674
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,880
talking about the one acre

1675
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:01,679
no we're talking about just legalizing

1676
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,400
recreational candidates oh i'm sorry and

1677
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:07,358
and i actually like learned after

1678
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,039
voting yes the first time and it didn't

1679
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:11,679
didn't

1680
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:12,798
past that time and then

1681
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:14,399
people

1682
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:16,880
specifically

1683
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,200
were doing education on like

1684
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,200
what some of the problems with the

1685
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:25,039
the current legislation

1686
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:26,558
were gonna be and so by then i was a

1687
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:29,679
little bit

1688
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:32,640
wiser and i didn't actually vote

1689
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:35,358
voted no on prop 64. yeah

1690
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:36,318
which was so weird for me to to do that

1691
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,358
but

1692
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:39,440
um

1693
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,119
you know i would venture to say that

1694
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,039
that was the right

1695
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,798
vote because

1696
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,719
unfortunately

1697
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,559
i mean it would have delayed

1698
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:50,480
people having access to cannabis like

1699
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:54,319
they do it would have delayed it

1700
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:56,159
by another couple years at least so that

1701
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:58,639
we could get something better

1702
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:01,038
but um

1703
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:03,679
yeah it just it seems like

1704
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:06,799
there were a lot of a lot of things

1705
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:10,159
that were hidden in it and or or just

1706
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:13,038
the way that it was um enacted

1707
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:16,000
what was disingenuous to what it was

1708
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,680
supposed to be so yeah that's politics

1709
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,760
you know like i mean

1710
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:21,759
how many people get elected on a

1711
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,799
platform and then never

1712
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,480
uh

1713
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:26,480
actually follow through with their

1714
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,639
commitments and it's too early

1715
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,039
64 in california

1716
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:33,038
did it did not follow through on its

1717
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:35,760
commitments at all

1718
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:37,680
and you know is it it's

1719
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,559
not i mean it's a little bit

1720
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:44,480
affecting humboldt seed company but

1721
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:47,200
but it's massively affecting the

1722
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,639
farms in the emerald triangle yeah and

1723
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:50,879
so

1724
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,879
um

1725
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,400
how are those problems playing out on

1726
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:57,440
the ground with the farms that helps

1727
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,440
humbled seed company

1728
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:02,000
i mean

1729
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,960
like we service

1730
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,400
like we're not unfortunately we can't

1731
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,358
really

1732
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:12,000
tell the big giant farms that

1733
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:14,960
want to buy our seeds that you know to

1734
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
go kick rocks because

1735
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,599
that's what we built the company to

1736
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,559
serve

1737
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,920
the animals and and so

1738
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,400
you know

1739
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,318
i'm not

1740
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,039
maybe i'm maybe i'm a little ashamed to

1741
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:32,480
admit that we sell the seeds to the

1742
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,640
farms that come and want to buy a

1743
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,358
hundred thousand and

1744
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:37,358
but um

1745
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,078
you know the the ones that are local

1746
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,679
here that

1747
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,798
i mean we kind of

1748
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:50,159
go try to go in above and beyond to

1749
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:51,519
do what we can to help and

1750
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,598
you know i think one of the biggest

1751
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:56,318
things is just educating

1752
01:03:53,599 --> 01:04:01,039
the consumer that

1753
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:01,038
you know there's something to

1754
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,039
there's something really good about

1755
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:08,639
small

1756
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:11,680
batch craft cannabis and

1757
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:14,719
people should seek that out and then try

1758
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:17,838
to support it economically yeah the wine

1759
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:19,679
industry is is uh something that seems

1760
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,358
comparable and

1761
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:23,358
i mean

1762
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:26,639
very friendly towards small wine

1763
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:28,078
wineries right and yet not the same with

1764
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:30,239
cannabis

1765
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,680
well but the problem is is that like i

1766
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,038
know now

1767
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:35,199
when i go

1768
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,480
you know shop for a bottle of wine i

1769
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:41,838
know

1770
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:45,119
the boone's farms from the small

1771
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:47,599
winery you know the moon winery that

1772
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:50,000
yeah that is like

1773
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,640
you know the local

1774
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,519
small batch winery and

1775
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,920
when i

1776
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:58,400
want i you'll never catch me buying

1777
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,798
boone's farm but you know like

1778
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,760
i want a nice bottle of wine that i'm

1779
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:05,038
really gonna like enjoy and and think

1780
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,319
about it

1781
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:10,480
and and have you know a nice experience

1782
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:13,199
and a dinner or whatever it is

1783
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,318
then i will always buy those wines that

1784
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:17,038
i know

1785
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:18,639
story behind it and i trust it and

1786
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:20,160
everything like that

1787
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:22,000
and uh

1788
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,239
you know occasionally i might get a

1789
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,599
bottle that's more just like

1790
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:27,919
general

1791
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:29,280
mid-grade wine but

1792
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,119
um

1793
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,720
the problem now is that you just can't

1794
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,838
tell like you walk into a dispensary and

1795
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:38,480
there's no differentiation

1796
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:40,480
boone's farm cannabis

1797
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,960
uh and

1798
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,880
the the local real craft small batch

1799
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,358
cannabis because you just

1800
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:49,920
it's such a new thing that

1801
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:51,119
we just don't know who's the budweiser

1802
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:55,039
from the

1803
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,559
you know lost coast brewery or whatever

1804
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:59,599
yeah

1805
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:02,839
you know miller high life to the uh

1806
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:06,160
sierra nevada or whatever

1807
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:08,239
and and so yeah um

1808
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,639
that's unfortunately

1809
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:13,679
everybody can put craft cannabis on

1810
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:17,038
their jar no matter how

1811
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:19,118
huge their farm is and

1812
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,520
and so it's it's going to take a while

1813
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,920
for that yeah what would you recommend

1814
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,759
for the state

1815
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,358
to do to save the

1816
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,839
small forces

1817
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:31,679
the state needs to like do

1818
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:33,279
actively be

1819
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:36,719
giving

1820
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:39,519
tax rebates and and everybody's kind of

1821
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:42,318
out there yelling like stop the

1822
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:45,599
campus taxes we need to do it

1823
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:47,920
and and we're gonna try to combat the

1824
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,960
the um

1825
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,639
black market whatever you want to call

1826
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,358
it the

1827
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:55,118
gray market illicit market and and i

1828
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,558
think that's kind of

1829
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,280
michael that's kind of told me i

1830
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:02,000
couldn't call it the black market

1831
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,720
because it contributes to a racist

1832
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,280
you know type of black white thing

1833
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:09,038
but then that's kind of just ridiculous

1834
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,280
like

1835
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,599
i think

1836
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,240
cannabis shouldn't ever be

1837
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:18,160
illicit it should never

1838
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,479
and it's like people should want to buy

1839
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:21,920
it from dispensaries because it's

1840
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:26,159
convenient

1841
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:27,838
and because it's tested and because

1842
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:29,920
they know what they're getting it's

1843
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:30,960
consistent and safe

1844
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,400
um

1845
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,720
not

1846
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,318
not because they're like forced to at

1847
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,558
gunpoint so

1848
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,558
um

1849
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:44,798
i don't think that like

1850
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,598
stricter punishments or harsher laws are

1851
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:50,798
the answer at all and and i

1852
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:50,798
do think that um

1853
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:59,440
um i do think that that

1854
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:02,159
people should be the tax rebates should

1855
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,720
be going to

1856
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:06,798
small farms that

1857
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:08,239
i mean one of the biggest problems that

1858
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:09,280
i see is like

1859
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:10,959
you have

1860
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,039
a certain amount of red tape that's

1861
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,119
involved with running any business at

1862
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:16,560
all and

1863
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:20,880
accounting

1864
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,880
it's permits it's uh

1865
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:25,838
taxes it's

1866
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,560
red tape it's like all of that stuff

1867
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:27,600
that

1868
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,440
is

1869
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,039
the admin of the business and

1870
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,439
one of the issues especially with

1871
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:37,039
cannabis is that there's this like

1872
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:39,919
level

1873
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,679
of of admin and effort that you have to

1874
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:46,158
do it's kind of like the barriers to

1875
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:50,480
entry or even the the maintenance of

1876
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:52,639
those those permits and and licenses and

1877
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,759
and then taxes and and reporting and

1878
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,679
accounting

1879
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,079
all of that stuff is like

1880
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,920
this level here

1881
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:04,158
and if you're a farm that's

1882
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,399
you know 80 acres

1883
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:09,119
it there's a little bit more

1884
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:10,719
work associated with that but

1885
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:13,358
you know if you're

1886
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,838
if you're only 10 000 square feet if

1887
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:19,039
you're like a really small farm

1888
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:21,198
you basically are doing the same amount

1889
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:23,198
of [ __ ]

1890
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,439
that a farm that is

1891
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:28,559
80 acres has to do

1892
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:30,479
um they're just adding an extra zero

1893
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,400
on the end of their

1894
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:35,198
spreadsheet so

1895
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,238
you know you may be doing accounting

1896
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:37,838
and

1897
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,559
it may be

1898
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:42,238
you know six six-digit

1899
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,520
accounting

1900
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:45,678
whereas

1901
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,719
you could just all of that stuff is just

1902
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:51,359
the same amount of work uh

1903
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,119
if you just add another

1904
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,960
zero on the end of it but it just

1905
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:56,800
equates to

1906
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,640
infinitely more

1907
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:02,400
more money or potential for profit

1908
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,119
and and

1909
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:07,679
my i guess my solution would be

1910
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:11,760
figure out ways to

1911
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:14,880
um either drop down some of the

1912
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:17,440
like generally some of the um barriers

1913
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,199
entry for the small businesses or

1914
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:22,799
or the

1915
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:24,158
how hard it is to maintain yourself in

1916
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,920
in the industry

1917
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:27,279
because if you're such a small

1918
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,199
business then

1919
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:31,198
you know the opportunities to have the

1920
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:33,839
things that they're worried about like

1921
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:34,799
robbery or diversion

1922
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,520
like the

1923
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,719
the risk is lower because there's

1924
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,880
less

1925
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,079
you know cannabis to be

1926
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,960
uh

1927
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:47,439
stolen or sent sent out the back door or

1928
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,279
whatever and so there should be less red

1929
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:51,439
tape but there's not

1930
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:53,198
and and i think that's kind of one of

1931
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:54,399
the biggest things that's killing small

1932
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,479
farms

1933
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:58,559
i think um

1934
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,479
and

1935
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,039
and another thing that i

1936
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:05,198
think that's ironic is that you know we

1937
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:07,039
touched a little bit on how

1938
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:09,279
for whatever reason indoor cannabis

1939
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:10,840
sells for a lot more money

1940
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:13,920
but

1941
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,760
that the tax is

1942
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,840
the bit one of the biggest tax i think

1943
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,800
the biggest tax is

1944
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,199
the the harvest tax which is 161 dollars

1945
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,000
a pound and

1946
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:26,000
so

1947
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,560
if you're an indoor grower you might be

1948
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,880
asking somewhere around you know fifteen

1949
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,760
hundred dollars to two thousand

1950
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,239
dollars per pound and

1951
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,239
you know it's the same exact

1952
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:41,039
you know you might have three percent

1953
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:43,519
turpins and you might have you know 25

1954
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:46,399
percent thc let's just say

1955
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,840
and then another farmer is producing

1956
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:49,119
cannabis

1957
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,600
outdoors

1958
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:53,679
that also has three percent turpins and

1959
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,280
25 thc

1960
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,640
but they're only

1961
01:11:55,279 --> 01:12:00,800
off getting offered you know

1962
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,360
uh 500 a pound

1963
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,119
but they're both getting taxed

1964
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:09,359
161

1965
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,679
no matter what for that pound so

1966
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,119
that works out like if basically the

1967
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:16,640
state is

1968
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:20,319
taxing indoor farmers at eight percent

1969
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:22,560
and taxing the sun grown farmers at 32

1970
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,960
percent and so

1971
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,719
to me i'm just like that's so bizarre in

1972
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,520
a state like california that's supposed

1973
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,439
to be

1974
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,760
you know

1975
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,399
green minded and and

1976
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:37,760
so on and so forth that that there

1977
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:38,559
wouldn't be uh any kind of thought given

1978
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,679
to

1979
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:44,000
to the effect that that's having because

1980
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:46,158
you know if you're a smart

1981
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,238
business person and you want to

1982
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:50,319
open up a cannabis business

1983
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:52,238
it doesn't take a genius to know that

1984
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:54,238
like

1985
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:56,319
you know right now at least it doesn't

1986
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,479
look like opening a

1987
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,359
a small farm in

1988
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:03,839
in the emerald triangle is a good idea

1989
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:05,279
because it's like right everybody's just

1990
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,600
saying like

1991
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,599
[ __ ] times are tough

1992
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,600
they shouldn't be because the freaking

1993
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,840
butt is just as good

1994
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,840
i mean

1995
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,640
these guys came in here with some bud

1996
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,480
yesterday

1997
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:25,039
and

1998
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:25,039
to me it looks honestly it looks better

1999
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,880
than most of the indoor flower that i

2000
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:31,279
see

2001
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,520
on the shelves in the stores and i was

2002
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:35,039
just like oh my god like you can

2003
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:38,000
hardly

2004
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:40,319
there's really

2005
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,000
i mean that's

2006
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:44,000
so frosty and just

2007
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,360
this is uh

2008
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:51,919
one straw

2009
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:55,198
organics or

2010
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:59,960
otherwise known as burr's place

2011
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,960
and that's the the hella jelly strain

2012
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,920
these guys are great i just had to

2013
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:05,119
change my batteries on my little board

2014
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,279
here

2015
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:09,599
i know i just i talked

2016
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:11,759
so much i got like

2017
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,360
my crew is sitting here telling me all

2018
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,920
right there's

2019
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:18,479
stuff happening we gotta deal with but

2020
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,520
okay i got one last little thing

2021
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:21,839
so

2022
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,840
um

2023
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,480
uh

2024
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:28,639
the current status of measure s

2025
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,399
and what humboldt county supervisors did

2026
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,280
to bring temporary relief to the farms

2027
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,158
up there

2028
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:35,198
yeah we really appreciate that i mean

2029
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:37,039
and

2030
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:39,119
and that's like humble looking out for

2031
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:42,000
humble so they got rid of 85 of the

2032
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:45,519
excise tax is that what it is and

2033
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,880
85 of the cultivation tax we call it

2034
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,480
here

2035
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:51,119
it was always based on your square

2036
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:52,000
footage so if you have um

2037
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,559
you know

2038
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,399
if you have 10 000 square feet you owed

2039
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,520
10 dollars a year

2040
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:59,599
and

2041
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,679
if you have twenty thousand yo twenty

2042
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,520
thousand actually though

2043
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,520
if you have like a mixed light it was

2044
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,640
more so there were

2045
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,080
uh

2046
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,079
different

2047
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:12,079
levels that you could have but yeah they

2048
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:14,559
they essentially now if you have ten

2049
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:17,439
thousand square feet you only owe

2050
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,560
um fifteen hundred dollars

2051
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:21,039
yeah

2052
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:24,239
so i mean that was great and

2053
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:25,439
and uh i think it's humble kind of

2054
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:27,919
seeing that

2055
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:29,839
it needs to invest and support this

2056
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,279
industry if it's gonna

2057
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,640
um

2058
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:35,519
capture the long-term benefits of it and

2059
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,400
i think

2060
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:40,640
as we see federal legalization happen

2061
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:42,719
and as we see people

2062
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,960
getting getting educated

2063
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,679
like the consumers becoming more

2064
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,359
educated and not you know just sort of

2065
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,399
basing their

2066
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:55,279
their decisions off of you know

2067
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:56,559
misinformation kind of

2068
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:57,519
that

2069
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,480
that

2070
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,280
it will be better for places

2071
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:04,879
like

2072
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:07,359
humboldt mendocino trinity

2073
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,279
the cradle of american cannabis so to

2074
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:10,238
speak um

2075
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:12,800
but

2076
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:14,479
for the time being uh

2077
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,199
the cards are kind of

2078
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:18,839
stacked against us a little bit or

2079
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:23,599
against

2080
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:27,520
um this community up here which is

2081
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:30,320
well we're all praying for the community

2082
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,239
yeah i mean you know people are

2083
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,479
it's people we've seen it we've been

2084
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:36,479
watching it coming so

2085
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:39,759
you know the smart folks are

2086
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,198
have but the problem was is that like

2087
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,560
the bar

2088
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:46,238
to get into the the whole race was so

2089
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,640
high i mean a lot of people just spent

2090
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:50,238
their entire life savings because

2091
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,119
what happened was

2092
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:56,959
you know it looked simple the

2093
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:58,719
applications for licenses were

2094
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,198
you know but then you you started

2095
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:04,239
talking to these other agencies that you

2096
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:05,839
had to get approval from like

2097
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,279
you know some of the environmental stuff

2098
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,400
was just like

2099
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:10,719
oh

2100
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,559
i've been an environmentalist my whole

2101
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,640
life but i'll just be the first to admit

2102
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,880
that some of it was just

2103
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:21,199
over the top and

2104
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:22,880
like certainly i know humble for example

2105
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:24,479
is the strictest

2106
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,679
environmental

2107
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:28,718
loss for any agriculture in the world so

2108
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,359
it's

2109
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:33,679
harder to get a permit to grow cannabis

2110
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:36,880
and humboldt county than it is

2111
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,880
to grow anything anywhere in the world

2112
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,520
and uh well

2113
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,159
maybe that's the way it should be but

2114
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,480
but it's kind of ironic when you know

2115
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:49,119
it's it's there's not any kind of

2116
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:51,119
environmental well there's very little

2117
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:52,238
environmental review if you're trying to

2118
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:54,960
open up

2119
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:56,839
a massive um

2120
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,319
indoor operation in a

2121
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,480
warehouse in the city

2122
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:03,920
and it's just like well what's the

2123
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:05,678
what's the impact really on

2124
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,880
humanity yeah

2125
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:09,920
uh like there may be some impact in like

2126
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,679
a

2127
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:16,640
a small forest ecosystem

2128
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,920
way way out in the middle of nowhere but

2129
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,719
you know

2130
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,119
a lot of these places it's just like

2131
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,279
there's logging and mining happening all

2132
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:26,479
around it

2133
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,238
yeah it's a

2134
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:30,079
bit of inequity there

2135
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:31,839
and yeah and

2136
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,238
and just

2137
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:37,279
yeah the the fact that

2138
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:39,519
you know the sun grown is kind of

2139
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:43,119
having the most

2140
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:44,880
environmental uh oversight compared to

2141
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:46,719
you know indoor and

2142
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,319
and stuff like that

2143
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,439
which leaves a much bigger carbon

2144
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,119
footprint

2145
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,198
as we all know

2146
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,519
well now i want to thank you very much
