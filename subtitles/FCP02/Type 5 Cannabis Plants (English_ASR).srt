1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,960
Travis do you want to go yeah I was uh

2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,960
quite curious what the practical

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,080
application of typ five plants are are

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,000
they going for fber are they going for

5
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,399
seed production is it just for the

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,640
purpose of triing and being able to test

7
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:30,118
as like a neutral almost super curious

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,439
yeah that's a great question um so the

9
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,679
I I guess it's hard to say what the

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,840
practical application is I can tell you

11
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,799
that they were um selected out of this

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,760
uh Eastern European breeding program

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:48,198
originally and that was a result of very

14
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:50,359
strict THC thresholds on hemp production

15
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:55,399
um so the goal was just to kind of

16
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:58,039
reduce all cannaboid production in to to

17
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,679
try to reduce total THC because their

18
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,280
their threshold was basically zero at

19
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,239
that point Point um you know in modern

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,359
applications there are some people who

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,520
are talking about

22
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,599
using hemp as like a hop alternative to

23
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,759
like Flavor beer which could be

24
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,679
interesting um it would be a really

25
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,680
interesting kind of control in um

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,720
medical studies like clinical studies

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,000
right to to have a the same background

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,000
but no

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,519
cannaboids

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,118
um

31
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,679
but yeah it's it's hard to say what like

32
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,438
actual practical applications there are

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,240
very interesting nonetheless that's

34
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,158
cool I like the idea of using it almost

35
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,118
as like a hop alternative that's super

36
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,359
cool I'm assuming it was for seed

37
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,000
production coming from Eastern Europe is

38
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,599
the foret like am I mistaken with

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,118
thinking that they grow mostly over

40
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:54,438
there for food for seed as food I'm

41
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,519
figuring if it was from like the Eastern

42
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:00,919
block yeah I I think it was mostly for

43
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,078
like Dual Purpose H grain and fiber

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,799
production um so they were harvesting

45
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:08,639
the fiber and the grain I just had this

46
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,640
the one question of so the type five

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,679
does not produce cannabinoids but is

48
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:17,119
there a gland there or is it

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:22,519
just Brack and

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,680
leave good question um we we did some uh

51
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,840
scanning electron micros could be of of

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,000
type five plants and compared them with

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,598
uh type four and type three and other

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,159
type plants

55
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,719
um and it looks like the they do have

56
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,959
the glandular tricomes but the heads

57
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,878
were the cannaboids and terpenoids

58
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,400
usually are appear

59
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:47,479
collapsed um and that's kind of

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,439
interesting for a few reasons um one is

61
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,560
that they appear collapsed which you

62
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,000
know is an interesting phenotype um but

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,158
the other thing is that they they're not

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,120
non-existent so it seems like they had

65
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:02,679
to inflate and then collapse so kind of

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,400
there's a question of like what uh what

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,840
were they inflated with and at what

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,080
point do they

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,799
collapse um because obviously in plants

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,879
that produce cannaboids they inflate and

71
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,840
then they don't collapse I think that

72
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,759
summarizes my and answers my question

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,640
really well that's that's super

74
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,719
interesting because when Damon first

75
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,439
mentioned it that that was where my head

76
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,959
first went is like okay no canono so how

77
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,840
does the Tricom itself up that's very

78
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,080
interesting so the head is collapsed oh

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,000
love to see see that like are there any

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,239
research papers that we can look at

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,479
online to see something like that if we

82
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:44,480
wanted to yeah um we published a paper

83
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,679
earlier this year I was looking at um

84
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,000
the impact or the the role of of

85
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,438
cannaboids in defense against insects

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,079
and we were looking at comparing type

87
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,959
three four and five plants and there's

88
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:58,200
some sem images there which showed the

89
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,878
collapsed um glandular tricomes there's

90
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:04,719
also a nice paper um by deire and

91
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,438
colleagues from 2009 where they're

92
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,000
discussing the inheritance of this

93
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:10,919
cannaboid free phenotype and they show

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,318
that you know it's a single

95
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:18,000
Locus kind of recessive um and uh they

96
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:19,918
have some nice sem images that show

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,720
these kind of collapsed or very deformed

98
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,719
tricomes as well
