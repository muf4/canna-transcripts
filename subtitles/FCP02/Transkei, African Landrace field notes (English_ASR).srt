1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,719
hey uh field notes again we already

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:08,638
started covering uh the transki uh we

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,800
showed you another Fino now we're at the

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:14,099
other side of the garden so this is from

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,460
our African sativas today is October

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,879
23rd I want to show you uh up close here

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,699
uh this plant is actually

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,500
in my opinion it's very close to being

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,560
ready for Harvest so if you want to come

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,219
in close on some of these buds see what

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,058
the final bud structure looks like

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,460
um

13
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:38,399
so I probably can go for a few more days

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,820
but it's just very very crystally but

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,879
they're tiny tiny tiny Teensy little uh

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,738
almost like pixie dust trichomes so when

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,179
you look at it at first you're like

18
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,119
where's the Crystal and then you look

19
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,679
closer and you're like oh it's totally

20
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,959
Crystal coated

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:59,479
but they're just tiny little trichomes

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,480
so um and the smell

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,400
oh my God

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,519
oh it's like it's Piney

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,000
also like a fresh parsnip a little bit

26
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:15,920
of parsley and Dill so very Savory herbs

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,599
but then also there's kind of a thicker

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,599
creamier almost like chocolate

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,759
almost like chocolate mint

30
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,560
um

31
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,719
but with

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,118
that's amazing

33
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,118
um but also with like parsley and fresh

34
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:39,478
parsnip like an astringent thing going

35
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,618
so very interesting so this is the

36
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:46,259
furthest thing from fruity Tootie

37
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:51,118
uh modern cannabis flavor this is very

38
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,819
Savory herb Piney astringent uh with a

39
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,920
little chocolatey yumminess in there so

40
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,599
really amazing very excited about this

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,700
