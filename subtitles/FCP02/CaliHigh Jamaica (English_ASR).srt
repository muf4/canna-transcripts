retrospectives called a work in progress

14
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,619
it is the story of my search for

15
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,558
Rastafarians and their herb and what

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,320
really happened in the lessons learned

17
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,939
this episode is a true story and is

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,000

Jamaica

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,460
I went to Jamaica when I was 18 in 1975.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
my oldest brother Chris my music mentor

23
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,199
and fellow cannabis enthusiast

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,759
had told me about a people called

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,840
Rastafarians who smoked herb as part of

26
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,759
their religion

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,118
he also briefly mentioned someone named

28
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,400
Bob Marley a Jamaican musician who would

29
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,140
be in town soon and Chris was going to

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,600
see him at the Roxy

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,819
meanwhile it was approaching the second

32
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,319
summer after I finished high school and

33
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,000
I had some money after selling

34
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,139
high-grade Colombian herb that whole

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,938
year

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,399
and hearing my brother's story of the

37
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,978
Rastafarians in Jamaica I bought myself

38
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,439
a round-trip ticket and early in July

39
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:09,780
flew to Montego Bay Jamaica

40
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,419
[Music]

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,759
I got a cab from the airport and found

42
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,199
an old hotel which had once been a

43
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,060
colonial mansion

44
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,259
it was all white and the rooms were

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,719
sparse

46
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:23,579
it had a certain stuffiness about it

47
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,039
had hardwood floors and there was a

48
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,959
weird vibe to the place the room was so

49
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,598
sparsely furnished there was just a bed

50
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,699
and one small bedside table

51
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:34,560
there was a balcony that opened onto a

52
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,719
view of the expansive lawn that spread

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,340
out in front of the Mansion to a view of

54
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,098
the bay off to the West

55
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,039
and the Caribbean to the north

56
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:45,780
it was mid-afternoon in July and after

57
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,959
depositing my things in my room I

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,300
decided to go find some Jamaican herb

59
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,939
walking down the hotel's driveway to the

60
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,640
street I found girls calling out to me

61
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,098
and dealers trying to sell weed

62
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,779
I asked one to get me some herb and he

63
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:02,579
said we had to get a cab and go up into

64
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,159
the hills to find it

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,959
I got a cab and we drove up the winding

66
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,539
streets into the hills of Montego Bay

67
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,519
near a Botanical Garden surrounded by a

68
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,959
little shanty town and a few shops and

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,519
lots of people just hanging out in

70
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,378
doorways on the street

71
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,780
we hopped out of the cab in front of the

72
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:21,479
botanical garden and immediately my guy

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,818
told me to walk 20 feet behind him and

74
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,500
as we walked all eyes were on me the

75
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:27,459
only white guy around

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,408
that was a new experience for me

77
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,409
[Music]

78
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:38,939
after a bit of a walk he told me to wait

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,639
by the garden and he went in not long

80
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:44,759
after he emerged with a small brown bag

81
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,859
filled with somewhat dried leaves it was

82
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,780
July and there were no buds yet

83
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,760
too early in the season and too late

84
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,560
from the one before

85
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,378
and it was then that I found out you

86
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,780
couldn't buy rolling papers in Jamaica

87
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:59,399
also cannabis was illegal in Jamaica at

88
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,378
the time

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,480
I remember taking a cab back to the

90
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,818
hotel by myself

91
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,699
I was told I could roll up a spliff in a

92
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:11,158
bit of paper from a thin paper bag

93
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,259
I thought I didn't relish

94
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,539
I was beginning to wonder why I hadn't

95
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,399
brought a bud or two of my Colombian on

96
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,139
a pack of zigzags

97
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,599
back at my hotel

98
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,660
I rolled up some leaves and some paper

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,479
from a small thin white paper bag

100
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,780
and as I took a few Puffs realized my

101
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,579
room was in no way airtight

102
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,679
that night in the dining room of the

103
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,659
hotel I met a tourist couple in their

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,000
20s from South Carolina

105
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,500
they had rented a car and tomorrow they

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,478
were driving to the West End of the

107
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,339
island to a place called Negril

108
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,719
where there were tropical beaches and

109
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,459
flood in the Sun

110
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,800
they asked me if I wanted to go with

111
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,839
them and I said sure

112
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,540
I figured they wanted another guy for

113
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,579
security and I was cool with that

114
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,800
surely Montego Bay wasn't what I had

115
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,719
imagined Jamaica to be like

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,300
the next day we were on the way out of

117
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,240
Montego Bay driving down the Palm line

118
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Coast above volcanic rock Cliffs and

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,840
white sand beaches to Negril

120
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,520
I had dreams of that drive for years

121
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,079
this was my first trip out of the

122
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,519
country and I learned two important

123
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,800
things that I would take away from

124
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,779
future travels one

125
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,120
the countryside has friendlier people

126
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,339
than the big city usually and two

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,579
traveling by yourself allows you to

128
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,659
experience a destiny that is 100 your

129
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,519
own

130
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,919
I don't remember the names of the couple

131
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,439
that drove me to Negril but I am

132
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,198
grateful for their help in getting there

133
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,600
Negril has a long coconut palm clad

134
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,478
Beach which gradually Fades into Cliffs

135
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,699
of volcanic rock as West End Road heads

136
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,258
West and then turned South at the West

137
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,960
End of the island

138
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,879
I rented myself a canvas tent under the

139
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,560
coconut palms on the White Sands of the

140
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,839
Negril Yacht Club

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,720
the biggest shot there was a Dugout log

142
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,478
that was fashioned into a canoe

143
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,759
from the Negril Yacht Club West End Road

144
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,758
was dirt and continued West for about a

145
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,360
mile past the awum away Lodge named

146
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,740
after the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight

147
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,740
which had little wooden Huts for rent

148
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,418
and from there the road went up away and

149
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,360
turned South

150
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:23,579
and there I found Rick's Cafe Rick's

151
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,020
Cafe was clearly named after Rick's Cafe

152
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:26,879
American

153
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,560
Humphrey Bogart's Club in the movie

154
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,139
Casablanca

155
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,839
it was an open-air Tropical Bar just set

156
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,819
back from the cliffs 35 feet above the

157
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,159
Caribbean Sea below

158
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,439
an oval bar with a palm thatched roof

159
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,180
and no walls which had a spectacular

160
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,699
view of the sunset

161
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,519
there were tourists sipping pina coladas

162
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,900
and drinking red stripes while enjoying

163
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,879
the view

164
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,859
just south of the bar was a miniature

165
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,459
Cove where people were jumping and

166
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,080
Diving from the cliff

167
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:00,839
there were regulars at Rick's and one

168
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,879
was the diver who clearly stood out he

169
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,258
was doing pipe two and a halfs into the

170
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,478
water below

171
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,699
during my time in the grill I went from

172
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,599
timidly jumping first feet from that

173
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,000
cliff

174
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,939
to pulling off one and a half

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,860
in tandem with the diver guy

176
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:18,538
I was on the gymnastics team in high

177
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,400
school and one of my teammates had had a

178
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,038
diving board where we practiced Dives

179
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,758
and so I knew how to dive but it never

180
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,500
dived from a 35-foot cliff

181
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,560
the main character at the bar was Rick

182
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,959
himself Richard Hershman was an

183
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,819
expatriate American from New York who

184
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,418
had settled in Jamaica and enjoyed his

185
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:41,580
days snorkeling in front of the cafe

186
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,680
we became friends and ended up knowing

187
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:47,038
each other for a few years after that

188
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,319
and eventually a lost touch with him

189
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,300
Rick had a certain world wariness about

190
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,039
him and wasn't far from a tropical

191
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
version of Bogart's character Rick

192
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,399
Blaine

193
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,639
except for the philanthropic movement of

194
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,198
refugees and he didn't run guns although

195
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,199
I did meet him the next year in Miami

196
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,740
for 35 pounds of Colombian but that is

197
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,740
another story

198
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,839
back at my tent that first day in the

199
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,519
grill I met a 40 year old Rastafarian

200
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,279
who hung out at the Negril Yacht Club

201
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,918
whose name was reford Ward

202
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,198
he had some herb mostly leaves and a

203
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,478
small battery-powered cassette player

204
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,680
he had only one cassette and it was not

205
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,079
a dread

206
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,538
by Bob Marley and the Whalers

207
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,879
we smoked leaves in my tent as the sun

208
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:35,278
was going down and I listened to reggae

209
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,740
for the first time in my life

210
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,439
reford put on side two first

211
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,538
so just say started playing

212
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,600
the music had an instant effect on me

213
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:49,259
the funky percussion the horns the

214
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,459
guitar and Bob singing I and I I know

215
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:54,240
Lego

216
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:56,518
and where I am I shall abide

217
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,860
it was exotic to my ears and gave me a

218
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,100
good feeling a feeling of honor and hope

219
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,740
and culture it was a profound moment and

220
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,379
even I knew it at the time

221
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,360
Bob singing about Jamaica

222
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,659
and me looking at Reef rewards two foot

223
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,019
long dreads they said dreadlock he said

224
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:18,240
as the song playing referenced the word

225
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,159
the music gave me a somewhat enlightened

226
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,039
and encapsulated cultural perspective

227
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,819
about Jamaica reeferred Ward and reggae

228
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,579
music

229
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,760
and there was Bob Marley singing Cold

230
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,399
Ground was my bed last night and rock

231
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,519
was my pillow too

232
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,580
this was a seminal moment in my life

233
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,679
a milestone and a great influence on me

234
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,320
musically speaking

235
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,939
when I would eventually go home I would

236
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,000
end up turning all my friends onto

237
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,220
reggae and Bob Marley

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,360
knotty dread became my soundtrack to

239
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,820
Jamaica

240
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,220
reefer Warden I became friends and we

241
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,720
listened to naughty dread whenever we

242
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,240
were together

243
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,339
reford was vegetarian and cooked his own

244
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,839
food which consisted mostly of vegetable

245
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,700
I tall soup

246
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,630
because he had lost most of his teeth

247
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,120
from lack of dental care

248

[Music]

249
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,560
one day we went on a trip up into the

250
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,959
hills of Westmoreland and after hiking

251
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,879
up a steep jungle clad slope

252
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,579
we came to a clearing and they are

253
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,838
surrounded by the jungle was reford's

254
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,139
Grill

255
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,320
it was July and the six foot tall ganja

256
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:31,019
plants only had leaves

257
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,660
corn was growing around the ganja we

258
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:36,419
started a fire and roasted some corn

259
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,399
and leaves to dry and smoke them and ate

260
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:39,719
the corn

261
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,159
afterwards we stopped by his mom's house

262
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,920
somewhere in the Rolling Hills of

263
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:46,379
Westmoreland he introduced me to his mom

264
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:49,379
and she served us lunch

265
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:52,200
later we took a bus back to Negril

266
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:54,240
the road was lined with tall grasses and

267
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,240
the sun was in the West

268
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,159
sunlight glistened off grass blades palm

269
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,500
trees appeared and passed as the bus

270
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,500
drove toward Negril foreign

271
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,500
Road between Wix Cafe and the Negril

272
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,879
Yacht Club became a daily walk I

273
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,620
remembered the mango vendor that would

274
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,220
push a cart up and down the road singing

275
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,259
out Mongo's sweet and juicy mangoes

276
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,300
he indeed had sweet and juicy mangoes

277
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,159
and I bought many from him

278
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,859
for a while I stayed at the awum away

279
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,659
Lodge on West End Road which had teeny

280
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,159
wooden Huts that were barely a step up

281
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,360
from my cannabis tent at the new girl

282
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,939
Yacht Club

283
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,519
Bermuda grass grew between the huts and

284
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,860
it was more lively than the yacht club

285
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,259
while there I met an american guy from

286
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,180
Florida who is a few years older than me

287
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:44,338
at the time who had overstayed his Visa

288
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:47,159
by six months and who offered to buy

289
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,600
mine for a hundred dollars I sold it to

290
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,120
him because I had a round-trip ticket

291
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,700
and wasn't going to overstate my Visa

292
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,039
which was on file and so I reasoned I

293
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,079
wouldn't need it and I didn't

294
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,838
I also remember driving to the Western

295
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,278
Union office in Westmoreland to wire my

296
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,380
mom for money

297
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,700
a week later I came back to pick up the

298
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,700
money thanks Mom

300
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,320
as it turned out

301
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,019
Rick was the only guy around who had any

302
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,600
buds he had a quarter pound bag of brown

303
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,459
Columbia Bud pieces and Shake

304
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,019
we had become friends and regularly

305
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,659
watched the sunset over the West

306
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:31,560
Caribbean while talking about Jamaica

307
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:33,838

bar patrons

309
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,040
one glorious afternoon the sun was

310
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,759
setting and was halfway down in the

311
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,679
water

00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:44,958
when a pair of jumping Dolphins

silhouetted the orange disc

314
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,219
there was also a cute blonde from

315
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,260
Florida who I met at Rick's Cafe and who

316
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,540
had taken a fancy to me

317
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,278
somehow we ended up naked in the shower

318
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,078
back at her hotel

319
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,519
which was the first hot shower I had

320
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,019
taken in weeks

321
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,659
she was sharing a room with her

322
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,339
girlfriends and privacy was at a premium

323
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:08,578
she was there for the weekend and it was

324
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:11,480
a short Affair a fond memory and yet I

325
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:11,479
can't remember her name

326
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,159
there was a Jamaican lady who sold

327
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,079
psilocybin mushroom tea from a little

328

she bottled the tea and old rum bottles

331
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,139
and lined them up on the stands counter

332
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,159
one evening I bought one from her and

333
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,259
drank it

334
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,958
I sat on the beach coming onto the tee

335
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,879
looking North toward Cuba

it was a beautiful afternoon and the sun

337
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,778
was setting

338
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,180
now I'm from California and I had only

339
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,799
seen wild lightning once in my life from

340
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,859
my Uncle Bob's roof in Jacksonville

341
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,899
Florida when I was in the 10th grade

342
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,360
and there are other contributing factors

343
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,159
to my reactions that evening but we'll

344
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
address the background of my psychology

345
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,899
later

346
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,578
Sunset faded to Darkness and I started

347
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,259
seeing flashes of light on the horizon

348
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:04,799
to the north

349
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:07,319
flash illuminated giant thunder clouds

350
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,059
and then the thunder clouds morphed into

351
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,220
mushroom clouds

352
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,018
and then each flash of light became an

353
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,360
atomic bomb Flash

354
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,519
somehow Reef reward was with me and I

355
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,459
was telling him I think the US is

356
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,259
dropping atomic bombs on Cuba he looked

357
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,838
at me as if I was high and then after a

358
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:28,819
moment of realization the vision melted

359
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,820
back into a thunderstorm on the horizon

360
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,539
reefer Ward and I never spoke after I

361
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,639
left Negril and somehow I would like to

362
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,919
thank him after all these years

363
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,560
he would be 87 now

364
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,479
and of those Jamaicans I know now none

365
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,399
have any reports of him

366
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,740
I did get letter from his niece who I

367
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,839
never met seeing how she saw me and

368
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,839
loves me and will I come back for her

369
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,278
my stay in Jamaica was a life-changing

370
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,440
experience if only for the introduction

371
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,838
to reggae but there was so much more

372
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,240
magic in my experience it has stayed

373
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,760
with me all these years Rick hirschman

374
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,519
and I exchanged numbers and a year later

375
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:12,379
he called me from Miami with business

376
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,379
and we'll save that for another story

377
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,160
epilogue

378
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,839
Reef reward taught me many things one of

379
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,939
them was how to grow Lamb's bread which

380
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,019
is really a growing technique and not a

381
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,120
strain

382
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,879
become a Cali High Patron right now by

383
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,360
going to patreon.com

384
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:32,220
calihai La and donating 25 and I will

385
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,320
send you the secret to growing Lamb's

386
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,019
bread for those of you at the hundred

387
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,019
dollar level I will also send 10 Afghan

388
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,899
land race seeds for you to practice with

389
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,759
so far our fundraising efforts have

390
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,919
fallen on deaf ears

391
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,419
and so we come to you this holiday with

392
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,578
an urgent request

393
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:53,159
this Christmas keep the gift that keeps

394
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:55,259
on giving and be generous so we can keep

395
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,600
the lights on here at Kelly High

396
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:59,159
without your help there may be no

397
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,899
calihai

398
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,939
because it becomes more and more

399
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,458
difficult to justify to My Wife and Kids

400
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,620
why I'm doing interviews and writing

401
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,299
stories that no one wants to donate a

402
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,060
few bucks for

403
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:14,759
donate now and you will receive good

404
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,319
karma points that will be redeemable at

405
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,360

406

Saint Peter himself will personally

407
