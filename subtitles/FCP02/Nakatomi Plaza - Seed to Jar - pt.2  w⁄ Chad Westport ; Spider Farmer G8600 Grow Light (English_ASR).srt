[Music]

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,939
hey everybody Chad Westport here and I

4
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,219
am back with another nakatomi Plaza

5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,320
update last time we saw these plants

6
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,600
they weren't looking that good I had

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,179
just come back from vacation and well

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399
you know the babysitter failed but

9
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,619
that's all right I've got these back to

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,840
hell and you might notice there's less

11
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,479
of them in here I started off with 10

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,059
seeds now because they got pretty

13
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,398
stressed while I was on vacation they

14
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,500
all showed me pre-flowers so I was able

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,140
to determine which ones were males and

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,539
which ones were females five females

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,399
five males fifty percent ratio that's

18
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,100
how it rolled with this batch of the

19
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,359
nakatomi plaza but I've done a few

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,579
things to them I'm getting them ready

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,939
for flour I'm gonna flip them into 12 12

22
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,259
later this evening but let's go in and

23
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:11,819
take a closer look and let me show you

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,680
how I prepped them all right so if you

25
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,899
remember the last video there were some

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,299
pretty gnarly looking freaking Leafs on

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,159
there definite deficiencies it was

28
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,140
actually a lockout which caused the

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,840
deficiency so plenty of the nutrient in

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,879
the soil oil again that's why diagnosis

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,859
and understanding the cause of these

32
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,780
things are important because if I just

33
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,819
saw it as a deficiency and I added more

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,340
that wasn't going to correct my problem

35
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,139
it would actually create more of a

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,079
problem because there would be a giant

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,659
imbalance in the soil so soil needs a

38
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,658
balance of nutrients and we got through

39
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,659
that lockout by well letting the soil

40
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,759
dry out amongst other things I upotted

41
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,259
them which drastically helped also

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,899
because I'm using the so home living

43
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,299
soil it's got nutrients in it so it had

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,978
kind of a fresh nutrient draw it can

45
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,840
pull from

46
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,420
but one thing that you notice here is

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,000
you know I've cleaned up the legs on

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,859
these I've gone in and removed some of

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,780
the lower branches I've not actually

50
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,759
done any training on these they're

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,878
growing like a Christmas tree and I

52
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,759
wanted to do that so you guys can all

53
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,560
see how it wants to grow naturally

54
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:21,539
typically I would top it typically I

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,539
would do some low stress training it's

56
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:27,000
going to create more apical colas but

57
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,818
this is a test run this is for you all

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,560
to see the nakatomi plaza just growing

59
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:33,839
naturally so that's what I'm letting it

60
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,120
do now I said I pulled off some leaves

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,500
I've cleaned up the legs before I flip

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,759
it I'm actually going to go in and

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,659
remove

64
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,280
some of these extra leaves as well so

65
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,739
let me actually scroll up and you guys

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,500
can take in the plants in their entirety

67
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,539
not huge you know again they're two feet

68
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,239
or under I just want to get these

69
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,699
floured give you guys an example of what

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,800
to expect kind of show you how the

71
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,179
different uh expressions are going so

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
this is what we're looking at right now

73
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,439
again I'm gonna go in I'm gonna do a

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,780
little defoliation real quick I'll then

75
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,818
show you a picture we'll wrap this up

76
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,640
and we'll put them into flour and there

77
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:14,818
you have it I've defoliated these pretty

78
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,199
heavily before they go into flour I

79
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:19,259
really don't think I'll have to do much

80
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,378
after this we'll see though but this is

81
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:25,560
these are the surviving five nakatomi

82
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:28,500
plazas the other five were males these

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,860
five seem to be female so we're gonna

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,459
flip them into flower tonight we are on

85
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,760
day 10 of flower

86
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:41,878
in the nakatomi plaza test group

87
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:44,519
let's go in and take a closer look here

88
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,919
a little pan down get you kind of a full

89
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,019
shot of what the noctomy plazas are

90
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,139
looking like and again you saw the last

91
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:55,080
video and how much I actually defoliated

92
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,759
before putting into flower Well yeah if

93
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,459
you look at them now they've definitely

94
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,340
bounced back and again day 10 you

95
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,080
definitely see some bud formation on

96
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,580
these plants here

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,819
so

98
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,900
starting to butt up properly I'm excited

99
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:11,759
because

100
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,860
I know what they're gonna finish like

101
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,500
but for you

102
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,379
here you go day 10 and again they're not

103
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,779
stretching uh very much at all which is

104
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,819
good the front two this one

105
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:28,918
and that one they're staying pretty darn

106
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:31,918
compact as far as the apical cola this

107
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:35,099
one in the back a little bit of spacing

108
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,139
out there one in the middle here a

109
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,600
little bit of spacing

110
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,100
and then this one in the back too a

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,100
little bit of spacing but again these

112
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,220
are just minor uh these are the nakatomi

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,080
plazas this is my test being group and

114
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,660
yeah as you can see day 10 things are

115
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,300
starting to Bud up for me it's day 21 of

116
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,780
the nakatomi plaza test I'm using that

117
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:01,259
soham living soil it's water only soil

118
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:04,319
it has the nutrients in it I've upotted

119
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,939
those gnarly looking plants into these

120
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,639
three gallons

121
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,160
got the watering right recovering from

122
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,040
somebody else taking care of them and

123
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,660
now look at them so they're on point and

124
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,300
again that's kind of good I'm glad they

125
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,020
went through the stress because it's a

126
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,060
test run of the nakatomi plaza so

127
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:25,680
sometimes stress is welcome so I wanted

128
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,319
to bring the camera down to this level

129
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,199
you can see how they are growing as far

130
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,779
as comparing the uniformity of them and

131
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,639
you know they are pretty darn close to

132
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,339
everything I mean really there's two

133
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,978
sizes in here we've got you know this

134
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,019
front corner here this front corner and

135
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:45,120
the one in the back those are all the

136
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,978
same size and then you got the one in

137
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,500
the middle and the one in the back there

138
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:51,839
those are the same size as well those

139
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,300
had just a little bit more stretch in

140
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,879
the epical cola area during the

141
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,240
transition it's now day 21 so those

142
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,100
things pretty much should have stopped

143
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,139
very minimal stretching on these which

144
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,600
is kind of indicative of the Westport

145
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,120
grape juice that's good I like to try to

146
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,919
keep things short but we'll go in and

147
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,720
have a closer look you see the fan

148
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,240
leaves see how those compare to each

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
other and also how the bud formation is

150
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,120
going

151
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:21,359
let me here is one of the nakatomi

152
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,340
plazas and you can see again the the

153
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,560
color along all of these are pretty

154
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,079
uniform we'll get to that Center one in

155
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,519
a second but here's the other one on the

156
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,978
other side that's kind of you know the

157
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,560
same size and as you can see you know

158
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:37,680
not a lot of stretching it's still very

159
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,240
compact here in that apical Cola these

160
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,879
don't have any training these are just

161
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,360
growing all natural so that is kind of

162
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:48,600
what you get we can zoom out here and

163
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,620
get this Center one oh let's zoom in on

164
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,660
it

165
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,240
and these are the ones that had a little

166
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:58,500
bit more stretch there in that apical

167
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Cola area a little one in the back

168
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,180
you can see that right there let me get

169
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,019
it to focus there you go on day 28 of

170
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,478
the nakatomi plaza grow out and yeah

171
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,918
let's go in and take a look at these

172
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,079
plants they've been growing well they're

173
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:17,159
in the Soho living soil I've been giving

174
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:20,818
them water only but I did top dress this

175
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,560
last week with the kiss organic nutrient

176
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,139
pack again that's what I've typically

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,459
have been using for top dressing so I

178
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,560
just gave it one top dressing and it's

179
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,659
been a few waters since but that will

180
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,538
work its way into the root Zone soon

181
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,780
enough give it a last little kick to get

182
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:39,060
it through flowering again day 28 right

183
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:42,239
now we're you know Bon Jovi about

184
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,918
halfway there and things are looking

185
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,918
good so let's go in and just take a look

186
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:51,500
at the plants back atomi Plaza and give

187
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:51,500
you all a quick scan of the canopy here

188
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:59,300
butting up nicely five plants two

189
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,300
different sizes not bad

190
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:05,698
all right we'll just call this the

191
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,800
number one nakatomi Plaza it is the

192
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,240
shorter size again there's two sizes

193
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,220
here there's kind of a short one and

194
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,519
then there's one that's about oh five

195
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:17,280
six inches taller but that's the paper

196
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,799
Cola at the moment it's starting to get

197
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,779
some nice dry Combs as well as the

198
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,300
auxiliary branches behind it so that's

199
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,918
number one we'll go over here to another

200
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,300
one that's about the same height this is

201
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,459
number two

202
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,038
see if I get that to focus for everybody

203
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:34,918
there a little bit of trichomes coming

204
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,740
in there and you know kind of all over

205
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,658
here nice Healthy Green

206
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,820
canopy spread out on the branches so

207
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,259
decent amount of Bud sites all right

208
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,480
we'll call that number two we'll go in

209
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,480
here to the center this is one of the

210
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,740
taller two that I have here and again as

211
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,360
you can see

212
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,299
it's really like a four inch height

213
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,399
difference so not a big deal but a

214
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,559
little difference anyhow so this is what

215
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,500
it's doing and I pulled off a couple of

216
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:04,079
the Leafs on this one already

217
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,320
um you know plenty plenty of Bud sites

218
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,259
this is going to grow plenty of nice

219
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,000
buds for me to smoke little colas pretty

220
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,799
stoked on that one

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,600
all right oh yeah don't forget about

222
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,559
seeing we'll check out the trichomes

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,259
here

224
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,299
day 28 starting to come in

225
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,580
oh then we go to this back one here and

226
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,620
this one is definitely putting on some

227
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,660
trichomes as well

228
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,459
this one actually just the way that the

229
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:31,919
pistols look this one reminds me of the

230
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:34,458
Westport grape juice a little bit more

231
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,639
so then

232
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:40,018
the father of this cross well I ran the

233
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,539
daughters out of the father so I know

234
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:46,019
what that is but uh yeah so this one I

235
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:48,599
guess we're calling number four

236
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,879
that's that plant and then we'll come

237
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,560
over to the number five which is one of

238
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,939
the shorter ones as well and this one

239
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,619
just has a little bit different bud

240
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,060
structure

241
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,700
it's a little bit of a different color

242
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:02,639
it's it's tighter there's more lease

243
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,500
here if you notice there on the uh

244
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,419
apical Cola

245
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,419
but it's getting some nice you know

246
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:12,120
auxiliary buds as well here and again

247
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,699
this is day 28 so there's gonna be a lot

248
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,580
more trichomes coming there's going to

249
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,980
be a lot more bug growth coming

250
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,980
