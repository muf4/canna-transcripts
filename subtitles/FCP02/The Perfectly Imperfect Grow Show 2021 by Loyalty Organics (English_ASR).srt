00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,039
plant

25
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,878
yeah she's really nice isn't it yeah i

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,039
like it a lot and i think kind of

27
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,640
learning what you can from every method

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,560
is really what i've always tried to do i

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,239
love talking to the synganic guys i love

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,840
talking to the hydro guys you know i

31
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,239
love talking uh

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,880
going from the land race and you start

33
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,919
reading it to one specific direction

34
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,560
describing them as like effects of

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,640
indica or sativa

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,159
really give a

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,000
a slight misinformation to keep that

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,920
going properly as well one of those

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,438
things like people will put seeds out

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,439
and you don't really hear much about it

41
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,359
and then all of a sudden like 90 120

42
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,239
days later you see a lot of a lot of

43
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,599
cooks

44
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,519
and so these are these are a couple

45
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,399
weeks old now these are these have made

46

they've had other dabs and other rosin

52
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,078
products and that they've been cheaper

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
packaging smaller and stuff like that

54
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,239
