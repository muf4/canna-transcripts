00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:12,399
welcome the blue stream aquaculture this

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,039
is our cape cod facility

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,039
built in the 1860s

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,519
as a trout hatchery

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,679
uh it's where we me and my family call

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,000
home and we call the home of fish brew

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,000
this is where fish brew started

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,759
our first three products bold flow and

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,198
epic flow are derived from this farm

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,719
as you can see

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,920
this is an old style flow-through

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,239
farm

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,559
with some updates with solar our solar

15
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,039
canopies do two things for us they

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,640
provide us with energy these panels

17
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,039
actually store the energy in batteries

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,558
so at night time we're we're on battery

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,000
power uh the these solar panels operate

20
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:56,479
and run about 85 percent of our energy

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,280
use that we need year round

22
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,198
they were installed five years ago

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,600
as you can see some of these some parts

24
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,959
of this hatchery are are

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,519
older than others this part of the

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,639
hatchery was actually originally used as

27
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:13,519
a tannery in the 1700s

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,478
the old stone race old stone wall

29
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:20,239
around it this this tank this pond here

30
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:22,640
houses our rainbow trout

31
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,640
and as we walk through the hatchery

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,200
we'll see more updates these raceways

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,840
here were reinstalled about four years

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,000
ago we tore out the old wooden raceways

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,680
but we kept the sand bottom

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,519
raceways

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,720
as you can see

38
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,879
our wells

39
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,478
putting water into the raceways

40
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,519
artesian wells

41
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:47,359
about 40 35 to 40 feet deep

42
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,359
here's a tank full of rainbow trout

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,000
these were fish from two years ago spawn

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,079
it's the sand bottoms of these raceways

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,078
and the beautiful water that we get from

46
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,438
an under underground sand river that

47
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,679
runs through the bottom underneath the

48
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,798
property that gives us the great quality

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,640
of water to start with for raising fish

50
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,520
it also is with the sand bottoms gives

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,039
us all the ecology over 160 years that's

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,920
been developed that's part really

53
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,439
important to part of our fish group

54
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,759
this race right here travels

55
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,079
all the way down it's about 400 feet

56
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,000
long there's fish in different sections

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
all the way down depending on years size

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
and species

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,959
over this way we have two undeveloped

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,480
raceways that we're in the process of

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,000
redeveloping

62
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,878
installing these panels over here these

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,719
concrete panels that we poured

64
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,079
that will give us a little more capacity

65
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,400
in the farm

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,360
this farm is primarily used for fish

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,920
leave here to get stocked

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,920
around the state

69
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,080
now we've moved to another part of the

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,680
hatchery this part of the hatchery also

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
older part of the hatchery with with

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,120
sand bottom raceways people often ask

73
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,800
how do we move the fish around the farm

74
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,560
and this is the way we move them we have

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,560
a stainless steel tank we also use this

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,000
for hauling the fish when we deliver

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,840
them to people's ponds for stocking

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,280
it's battery operated aerator on the

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,239
back of the tractor we fill it with

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,479
water

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,239
add the fish and move it around pull up

82
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,679
alongside the tank pull the valve and

83
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
dump the fish in

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
uh we're moved this time of year is what

85
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
during the summer is primarily we're

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,920
doing is grading and moving fish getting

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,759
ready for fall

88
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,559
uh this tank here is one of our older

89
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,679
raceways uh it's wood lined with a sand

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
bottom

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,959
these fish here are brood stock rainbow

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,080
trout

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,199
we have about 350 fish in there

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239
we'll start spawning rainbow trout about

95
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,439
mid

96
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,878
august to the end of august

97
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,878
over here is our

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,959
hatch house this is where we hatch and

99
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,200
spawn is where we take the eggs

100
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,959
by hand stripping we bring them into

101
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,399
that building and we have incubators in

102
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,680
there where we spawn the fish right now

103
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,039
there's nothing in there because

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,080
spawning season is still a month and a

105
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,359
half away

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,519
uh this is our experimental greenhouse

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,080
um where we do a lot of different

108
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,360
experiments with our fish brew products

109
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
we started testing the fish food

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
products about six years ago

111
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,519
before we at least four years before we

112
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,959
brought them to market

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
and we'll take a walk inside there but

114
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,879
you can see here some of our outdoor

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,839
gardens that have also had been treated

116
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,839
with fish brew

117
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,759
our blueberries which i've seen fish

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,600
brew bold and hydrolysate as you can see

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,160
they're very large

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,160
and this year uh we have

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,160
quite a bit of fruit developing on the

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,840
on our blueberries

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
and only being the first week of july

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
and we'll take a quick walk through our

125
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,280
greenhouse this is our greenhouse where

126
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,879
we do a bunch of different

127
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,758
types of experiments this is a

128
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:07,759
hydroponic nft where we do testing with

129
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,360
hydrolysate and fish brew epic

130
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,560
same here this is a floating raft

131
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,160
culture

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,918
we're doing different stress tests with

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,439
plants right now

134
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,120
we have some soil beds that we've

135
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,959
developed

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,959
making living soil from our products

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
we have

138
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,560
tomatoes uh aloe plants

139
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,038
uh in here

140
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,560
we have a variety of plants

141
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,560
these plants here are all on our rise

142
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,399
and thrive products

143
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
we're doing a trial in here right now

144
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,000
for growth

145
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
stress

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,360
and as we move through there's more

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,360
tanks in here that have fish

148
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,239
you see these are small rainbow trout

149
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,120
we try to utilize all the farm

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,879
um

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,600
here's my prized zucchini plant this

152
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,680
year this plant was completely grown on

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
bold

154
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
blue bulb products

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,360
no other fertilizers used

156
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,439
as you can see it's a

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,120
very healthy plant large

158
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,120
leaves are much larger than my hand

159
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:23,199
[Music]

160
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,280
we have some dry product that we're

161
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,800
starting to develop

162
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,559
of fish brew

163
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
[Music]

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,000
it's a very light

165
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,800
product has a very nice um a lot of

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,918
properties of npk also has a very nice

167
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,520
for making a compost tea

168
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:42,879
there's some small brewers that we do

169
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,240
testing with

170
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,000
we'll come around this side of the farm

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,600
as we exit the greenhouse

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,279
we come out to another system this is

173
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,599
where we collect a lot of our waste for

174
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,038
the fish brew there's a series of tanks

175
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,800
here

176
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,439
it's a flow through

177
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,439
with recirculating components

178
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,560
we have a drum filter where we take off

179
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,319
the waste

180
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,439
water then passes through a biological

181
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,598
filter

182
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,199
water comes in from our pond

183
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,319
um in the front of the hot in the front

184
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,478
of the farm

185
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,240
passes through here the water that is

186
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,399
being introduced by the pond overflows

187
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,038
into another series of raceways on the

188
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,318
back side of the farm but these tanks

189
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,079
here housed

190
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,080
rainbow trout brook trout and brown

191
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,079
trout

192
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,079
all the tanks are covered for netting to

193
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,079
keep the birds away

194
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,240
as we move down here this is a second

195
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,159
system

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,439
same thing we have a container where we

197
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,439
harvest the waste

198
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,959
that later becomes our fish brew

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,478
this is another drum fill filler there

200
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,638
that's taking the waste off

201
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,560
very slow moving filter constantly

202
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,000
sucking off the waste

203
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,000
putting it into this tank here

204
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,680
which is a thousand gallon holding tank

205
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,839
that we aerate

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
it's the beginning of this brew

207
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,000
from handle from here this tank it's

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,038
transferred into our barn where we have

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,038
different brewing rooms

210
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,319
now we're going to enter into one of our

211
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,720
brewing rooms these are located in our

212
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,360
barn on site

213
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,759
these brewing these brewing containers

214
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,839
are both 250

215
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,600
gallons

216
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,279
so we always have on storage at least

217
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,278
500 gallons of the bold product

218
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,199
and then we do all of our bottling and

219
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,278
labeling in this room

220
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,360
we also have our storage for hydrolysate

221
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,278
that we bring from our other farm ryzen

222
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,600
thrive which is our newest one of our

223
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,200
newest products that's a combination of

224
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
cape cod farm in new hampshire farm

225
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,560
giving us different bacteria fungal and

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,879
protozoa protozoa from the bold product

227
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,599
so we're trying to utilize both farms

228
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,559
and there's the third brewer that has

229
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,560
the rise and thrive

230
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,319
that's a quick overview of our farms um

231
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
i want to give you guys a quick we tried

232
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
to do it on a podcast we were unable

233
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,240
unsuccessful to keep a

234
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
feed going but that gives you a general

235
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,200
overview of what our farm on cape cod
