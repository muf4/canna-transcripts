3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,919
southern oregon

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,879
my name's mike i go by the name dozier

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:13,439
grower on discord and southern oregon

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,519
soil on instagram i'm gonna go ahead and

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,679
give you a tour starting with the

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,079
strains and the breeders

9
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:24,480
start with this first plant uh this is a

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:27,198
pre-98 bubba kush from 2020 mendocino

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,160
she's about 65 days flowering time it

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
says

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,760
she's just now starting to put on some

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,119
thickness

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,800
and stacking up

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,359
it looks really good

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,519
uh these next three plants are going to

18
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,280
be from humboldt seed company and their

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,320
pineapple muffin

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,558
they say about 45 to 55 days for flower

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
and they're taking just a little longer

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,359
might because i'm further north and

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,800
humble

24
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:55,280
but they're putting on a lot of good

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,280
crystal a lot of good terps on them

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
this is pineapple muffin as well

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,400
and again pineapple muffin

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,400
by humboldt seed

29
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,679
these next ones are also humboldt seed

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,680
they are all gas og

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,520
they all seem to be different phenotypes

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,118
they are 55 to 65 days

33
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,560
they are just really putting on some

34
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,640
weight now

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,079
this one doesn't seem to have any purple

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,840
in it yet

37
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,478
this

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,680
one is the biggest of them

39
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,560
um

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,118
and she is just now starting to put

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,118
color on

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,439
and the third one here

43
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,039
has decided to just put the color on

44
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,359
right away

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,240
as you can see

46
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,239
very pretty color

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,439
this next one here is gorilla skittles

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,159
from barney's farm

49
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,839
and she is doing very well she's another

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,079
65 day

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,118
55 to 65.

52
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,199
um

53
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,200
definitely leaning towards the gorilla

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,679
glue side of it not really seeing any

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,199
skittles colors coming out but uh

56
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,840
her coal is

57
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,839
really nice

58
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,729
these next two

59
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,079
are

60
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:21,519
[Music]

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,360
melon runts from elevate seeds

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,040
really impressed with uh

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,200
the smell

64
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,199
um and the bud structure on these

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,840
this is another melon runts and again

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,840
these are 55 to 65 days

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,039
and then these last two girls down here

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,280
are again by humble season they're

69
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,639
stupid fruits and they say they're at

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,080
about 70 day flowering time

71
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,079
i need to clean them up a little

72
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:02,039
very nice putting on some

73
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,039
really good buds and coalish

74
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,958
uh as you can see i like to clean up

75
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,958
inside the plants

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
i'd also like to give a shout out to

77
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,680
soilscape solutions

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,159
i've been using their four-year program

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,120
not the complete program but the uh

80
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,759
nitrogen phosphorus potassium

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,640
the micronutrients

82
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,878
as well as the humic

83
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,958
and i think i've been getting a really

84
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,560
really good response to it

85
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,640
as you can see

86
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,519
um quite frosty

87
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,039
um

88
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,519
have a lot of ladybugs and um

89
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,439
the ipm's been really good this year i

90
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,039
have a feeling it has to do with some of

91
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,959
the companion plants that i'll get to

92
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,719
here in a little bit

93
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,479
but again

94
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,680
really impressed with the soil escape

95
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,199
solution

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
for your feeding

97
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,679
i believe it has a helped immensely with

98
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,879
the uh

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,200
crystal production and the terpenes

100
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,518
so again big shout out to soilscape

101
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,158
solutions i'm gonna go over

102
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,079
my soil and my pots i am using living

103
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:17,199
soil this year i'm using a blue matte

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,600
system

105
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,199
with blue matte carrots and blue matte

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,759
soaker hoses

107
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,840
i actually am very lucky i have well

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,759
water that runs at about six five

109
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,638
ph um so i can just run it right off the

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,360
tap

111
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,759
it goes into a psi reducer which i don't

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,639
let it get above 40 and then that goes

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,960
into

114
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,280
a blue matte reducer which takes the psi

115
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,039
down to 15.

116
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,758
then i've run

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,520
the soft eight millimeter line

118
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,560
and made a manifold

119
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,399
and

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,680
it runs down

121
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:57,198
either inside of the pots

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,280
and then there is two carrots in

123
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,280
each pot

124
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,279
as you can see let's look under here

125
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,959
lots of worms

126
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:16,000
um and as i say the roots do

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,240
grow up to the hoses

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
so

129
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:26,399
i'm using a straw cover

130
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:29,279
as well as a clover i have

131
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,478
basil i have chamomile

132
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:36,879
and i believe lemon balm in here

133
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:40,319
i put a ant trap near the bases

134
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,719
of the trees because they that way i

135
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,719
don't get any aphid problems from ants

136
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,720
it goes straight for that i also have 18

137
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,199
inch blue matte

138
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,840
digital monitors

139
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
in pots

140
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,599
keep it a little drier during flowering

141
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,318
so

142
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:07,240
they don't need as much

143
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,240
again the hoses are in a ring

144
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,560
as you can see

145
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,719
and one last thing you'll notice is uh

146
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,199
they're 200 gallon pots that i've

147
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,840
wrapped with pallet wrap

148
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,639
to kind of mimic the grassroot fabric

149
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,758
pots living soil pots

150
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,759
to kind of reduce the evaporation

151
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,160
so that has been working well

152
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,199
we had a really hot summer up here this

153
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,400
year

154
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,478
um a couple weeks and over a hundred

155
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,038
consistently on the days

156
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,038
um and the system worked really well

157
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,680
uh the plants loved it

158
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,680
and you know for everything said and

159
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,720
done with all the smoke and the hot days

160
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,120
this year

161
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,120
uh my first year living soil

162
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,439
i think it's turning out fairly well and

163
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,360
i'm very impressed with uh

164
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,319
the process and i think i will stick

165
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,080
with it

166
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,598
thank you very much and if you have any

167
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,598
questions please get a hold of me
