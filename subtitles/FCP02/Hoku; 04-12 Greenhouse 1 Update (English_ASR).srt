1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
what up I figured I'd do a garden update

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:08,820
this morning uh it's been a little while

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,440
as it usually is but uh kind of had a

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,059
rough start to the year finally got

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,000
everything switched over to the big pots

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:18,719
and had a pretty good cycle going and

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,399
then uh I decided to spray the uh

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,239
the Weeds on the side of my Greenhouse

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,579
with some 30 vinegar and uh the plants

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,778
did not like it overspray got caught in

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,598
the fans

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,278
and fried the plants so

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,500
as you do in farming how to make the

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,559
tough decision whether to uh

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,058
replant or try and nurse those along and

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:40,799
since they were already in like the

17
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:41,939
first week of flowering I just decided

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,339
to uh

19
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,920
coal everything and and restart so

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,879
fortunately I had a couple trays of some

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,120
plants

22
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:54,780
and uh planted those

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,718
and uh we are already flipped again so

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,980
set me back I don't know

25
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,660
too

26
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,358
it's a

27
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,738
sure it's not the first time

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,320
it's not the last time it's definitely

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,340
not the first time so but anyway we got

30
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,379
a

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,978
some Auto projects going in here I just

32
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,359
pollinated and see the Fallen sacks

33
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,719
um you can spray everything down here in

34
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,900
a few days and then these

35
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,179
Fino hunt so I definitely learned a lot

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,478
from the first run

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,720
I had kind of uh the plants over planted

38
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,640
overcrowded so now we're doing

39
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,640
like three plants

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,799
per pot in the 200s I've got some

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,900
singles

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,939
which are doing really good

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,840
and uh

44
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:44,578
yeah

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,780
stoked for this run I mean these big

46
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:48,719
pots have definitely been a learning

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,640
curve I'm used to 10 gallons

48
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,158
and plants just don't grow as quick and

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,920
don't get as big and so uh

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,320
yeah a few you know take your eyes off

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,118
them for a second they've gained a foot

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,578
so

53
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,359
lights are coming on

54
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,359
um

55
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:09,139
this is the first Greenhouse uh this

56
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,139
stuff will be ready

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,098
but uh got some adus code doing a big

58
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,040
Pinot hunts of Ada's code

59
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:18,719
also Oz

60
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:21,179
which is probably one of my favorite

61
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,960
crosses from the Oz series

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,459
and then

63
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,099
[Music]

64
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:30,120
uh got some uh stuff on that back row

65
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:34,079
but yeah here we have it

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:38,099
haven't even sprayed this crop once

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,800
haven't had any pest issues just watered

68
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,359
in some nematodes for the gnats

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,219
it's like all this Clover's starting to

70
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,360
die off

71
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,680
but

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,599
I guess technically this is like my

73
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,800
second cycle in this this greenhouse

74
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,899
even though I didn't finish the other

75
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,140
one but

76
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,939
yeah got uh gotta finish

77
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,579
bambooing everything trying to move away

78
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,318
from plastic trellising we'll see uh I'm

79
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,879
sure I just made myself

80
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,039
over

81
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,719
it's uh

82
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,000
yeah

83
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,000
yeah Greenhouse number one

84
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,939
it's all set

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,039
you can head over to Greenhouse number

86
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,900
two which I direct said

87
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,679
yeah these are

88
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,680
looking good

89
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,939
I figured I'd do a little Auto project

90
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,939
in here before everything gets going so

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,378
not getting the best light but

92
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,378
enough to play around with

93
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,239
yeah

94
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:44,939
so I'm definitely running less plants

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,599
but I think I'll be able to see

96
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:50,878
you know uh their true expression as far

97
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,619
as like

98
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,098
morphology and how they want to grow

99
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,099
naturally

100
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,480
see some of these are kind of lanky

101
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,479
but uh

102
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,939
yeah I'm just running three different

103
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,709
cultivars in here

104
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,959
three of my favorites and

105
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:13,939
[Music]

106
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,938
uh see uh see how everything does

107
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,199
up over the next train house
