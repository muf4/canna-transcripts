[Music]

2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,199
so

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,118
hey friends greens goddess here

4
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,599
today we are going to be making some

5
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,599
cannabis oil first

6
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,798
what we're going to do is i got my

7
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,959
gloves on and i've been grinding down

8
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,000
some pretty high grade marijuana here

9
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,478
organically grown by myself pesticide

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,400
herbicide free thank you very much

11
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,319
no chemicals used to make this good

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
quality stuff right here

13
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,879
um what i'm doing right now is i'm kind

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,439
of breaking up these buds

15
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,519
uh before i decarboxylate them some

16
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,879
people might go ahead and put their weed

17
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,599
in the oven first and then after

18
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:50,560
decarboxylation they break up the buds

19
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,719
where i live it's pretty dry

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,960
so our buds are

21
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,078
our buds are ready to be grinded up

22
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,759
right now

23
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,279
but if you lived in an environment where

24
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,640
it was very moist

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
it would be hard

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,599
to kind of grind all this up especially

27
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,679
using like your gloves your fingers or a

28
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,679
grinder or scissors

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,480
just something to consider

30
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,560
regardless before or after de-carving

31
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,679
we're gonna grind up our buds just like

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,280
this

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,959
in here i got about two ounces

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,439
i would like to show you two different

35
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,959
ways of doing this one is my favorite

36
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,800
way with uh

37
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,719
coconut oil

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,319
and then another way is to make a

39
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,479
cannabis butter

40
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,759
i already have my

41
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:39,598
oven preheated to 230

42
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,439
i get a turkey bag and i put my cannabis

43
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,639
in the turkey bag most people don't do

44
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,159
that

45
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,159
but um

46
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,919
i go get my stuff tested over at the

47
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,359
good lab obviously this turkey bag is

48
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,598
way huge

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,920
what size is this one

50
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:53,919
um

51
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,359
i guess it doesn't say a size just

52
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,518
turkey size

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
but anyways i use turkey bags and the

54
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,319
reason why

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,200
i do this

56
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,238
is because um when you're

57
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,560
decarboxylating i was told that

58
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,680
sometimes your um

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,158
terpenes and whatnot might get lost

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,319
in the atmosphere as it's heating up and

61
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,719
the best way to hold on to all of that

62
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,479
and to keep it in the

63
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,318
cannabis here is by putting it in a

64
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,759
turkey bed

65
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,280
so

66
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,359
here's two ounces of cannabis

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,000
grind up nice and smooth

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
i took out the majority of stems and

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,719
seeds but there's still going to be some

70
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,479
in there

71
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,439
place it on my cookie sheet just like

72
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,119
this

73
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,199
i like that this is a little puffy

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,840
because as it goes in the oven the heat

75
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,719
will make this puff out like a balloon

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,840
so oven is ready

77
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,840
cannabis is ready

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,080
i'm gonna put it in here and set the

79
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,438
timer

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,000
for

81
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,280
30 minutes

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,438
there we go

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,199
don't forget to press start

84
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,158
now i'm going to do this two ways one

85
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,438
with butter and one with coconut oil um

86
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,239
i prefer

87
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,598
using mct coconut oil it stands for

88
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,878
medium chain

89
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,879
triglyceride and basically um this kind

90
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:17,599
of coconut oil and it's very healthy for

91
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,798
you

92
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,439
it never um solidifies

93
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,959
it always stays in a liquid form there's

94
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:29,040
also this kind extra virgin coconut oil

95
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,879
um

96
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
cold pressed unrefined

97
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,079
this one smells so good

98
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,000
this one is solidified right now and if

99
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,758
the temperature is warm it will become

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,759
liquid if the temperature is cool it

101
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,520
will become a solid i use this for

102
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:49,199
certain ingredients like if i wanted to

103
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:49,198
make creams or if i wanted to make um

104
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,719
like cannabis capsules like the canvas

105
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,478
medicine filled in capsules i use this

106
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,320
also if i want to make brownies this is

107
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,359
my favorite coconut oil to use to make

108
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,159
brownies

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,400
if you're going with a oil like method

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
oh um you could also use extra virgin

111
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,879
olive oil if you wanted to use that too

112
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,560
these are all great for cooking as well

113
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,399
if you're going to use

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,560
this kind um

115
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,359
the cannabis needs something else to

116
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,800
bind it to the oil so one thing people

117
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,439
like to add is either sapphire oil

118
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,840
or a little bit of sunflower oil not too

119
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,719
much probably just about a spoon or two

120
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,399
full with the whole entire thing i'll

121
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
show you about that later

122
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,679
another thing you could also do if you

123
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,120
don't want to do oil you want to make

124
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,199
butter is

125
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,918
grab this is about a half a pound eight

126
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,520
ounces of butter i prefer goat's milk

127
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,599
butter oh my gosh if you've never tried

128
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,000
it yes i highly recommend it

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,919
so right now we've got our oil cooking

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,918
and we're just gonna wait when it's done

131
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,560
we'll get back the timer went off time

132
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,758
to take it out

133
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,160
got my

134
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,919
halloween oven mitt

135
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
because it's that time of year i just

136
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,599
want to show you guys

137
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,359
what it looks like when you go take it

138
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
out see what i mean by it puffs up like

139
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,919
that

140
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,000
you do not want to touch this right now

141
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,240
do not open it

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,120
put it down on your counter

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,960
let it cool off for just a few minutes

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,918
uh also i turned my oven off

145
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,239
i filled up my crock pot with two cups

146
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,359
of my mct coconut oil you could find

147
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,079
this online i got it from amazon

148
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,160
or if you're using regular coconut oil i

149
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,000
used two cups of that so it'll be two

150
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,520
cups of um

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
coconut oil

152
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,959
or um whatever oil you want to use two

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,038
cups for one ounce of freshly grinded up

154
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,758
weed um

155
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,560
i don't want to forget to put in my

156
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,000
spoonful of sapphire oil

157
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,639
i have this set in my crock pot on low

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,560
for now but as i'm cooking the cannabis

159
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,439
in it it's going to be set on warm for

160
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,839
about four or five hours

161
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:04,000
so let's go ahead and put this

162
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:07,439
in this is gonna get all warmed up while

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,439
i'm letting the weed cool off

164
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,560
is this the never tighten my lid that i

165
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,400
have here there we go

166
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,800
um what else do i have

167
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,120
okay so over here for the butter you

168
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,280
guys see butter i don't have a double

169
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,598
boiler and if you don't have the double

170
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,079
boiler set that's fine you just get

171
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,598
yourself a regular pan and put another

172
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,598
pen on top of that

173
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,839
i don't have another pen the same size

174
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,639
so i'm just using like

175
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,879
a

176
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,038
heat safe glass dish it works the same

177
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,360
way

178
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,680
i chopped up my favorite butter into

179
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,038
cubes and this will help them melt

180
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,959
faster

181
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,120
i'm just going to carefully put that on

182
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,079
there

183
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,439
and i'm going to turn this oven

184
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,359
on as low

185
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,038
[Music]

186
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,280
actually i want to get it boiling at

187
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,519
first so i'm going to turn it up

188
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,359
probably about a medium high heat

189
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,120
until this water starts boiling then

190
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,400
i'll probably turn it down just a little

191
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,959
bit

192
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,079
you don't want this boiling too crazy so

193
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,159
i have a half a pound of butter in here

194
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,318
most people do a whole cup of water and

195
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,400
i don't really understand the point of

196
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,759
putting in a whole cup of water because

197
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,038
in the end they end up straining it

198
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,560
anyways

199
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,478
so instead of one whole cup i'm just

200
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,079
going with three quarters of a cup i

201
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,598
still want to follow the same recipe

202
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,959
that everyone else is doing i'm sure

203
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,878
that they have a good reason why they're

204
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:34,079
doing it but you'll see in the end we

205
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,000
end up uh straining this keeping the

206
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,399
butter and getting rid of the excess

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,399
water

208
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,839
okay

209
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,600
so this is going to warm up and melt

210
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,679
this is going to warm up this is going

211
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,360
to cool down we'll get back at it and

212
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,599
weigh out the canvas

213
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,680
all right friends

214
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,519
is cooled

215
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,838
i'm going to go ahead and weigh it just

216
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,919
because i want to make sure i'm putting

217
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,600
half of this and my butter and the other

218
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,599
half in my coconut oil

219
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,399
[Music]

220
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,919
want to go back real quick and talk

221
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,679
about the carving

222
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,360
depends on what kind of cannabinoids

223
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,519
that you're looking for

224
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,680
a lot of people

225
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,519
might be able to benefit off of cannabis

226
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,000
and its acidic form therefore you may

227
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,720
not need to decarboxylate and a lot of

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,080
people want to decarboxylate their thc

229
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,000
converting it from thc a into thc when

230
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
it gets decarboxylated that way they get

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,839
that nice high when they're consuming

232
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,360
this medicine

233
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,360
honestly when i typically make my oils i

234
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,159
do a very very very light cook in the

235
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,480
oven that way i have both

236
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,958
the cannabinoids in their acidic form

237
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,039
and their converted form and it shows up

238
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,599
on the test results when i go to get the

239
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,679
oil tested so that's just me personally

240
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,278
i know a lot of people like just having

241
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,199
edibles and getting really high off of

242
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,879
them so if that's you do the

243
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,160
decarboxylation

244
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,720
in the oven for uh 230 degrees for 30 to

245
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,078
40 minutes um

246
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
so

247
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,919
good good good just a bit under two

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,039
ounces obviously it took some weight off

249
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,199
of there

250
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,799
this already has my coconut oil a

251
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,160
spoonful saffron

252
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,599
safflower oil warmed up

253
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,439
i'm just going to put a little bit in

254
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,360
here and bring this back to weight to

255
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,800
make sure i'm still doing good and not

256
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,800
going over too much all right

257
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
something like that a little bit more

258
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,078
yep that's about halfway there and then

259
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,600
the other half i'm going to put in this

260
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,159
butter

261
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,879
very carefully because uh

262
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,559
my glass bowl um since i don't have a

263
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,320
double boiler

264
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,479
pretty small

265
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,839
i moved this over here so that way

266
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
i don't know something about this burner

267
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,279
it just gets real hot no matter how low

268
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
you put it up

269
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,240
plus this way you guys could kind of see

270
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,958
the butter over here and then the

271
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,600
coconut oil over here it works out well

272
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,679
i'm getting my favorite spatula

273
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,959
i'm gonna blend this in over here really

274
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,958
nice and mix it around

275
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,919
and then i'm going to be super careful

276
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,399
over here blending this and then mixing

277
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:30,799
this around

278
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,799
so some people like to take um

279
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,919
their cheese cloth

280
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,560
and like

281
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,838
their decarb grinded up

282
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,838
cannabis

283
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,519
and roll it in like a burrito and wrap

284
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,360
some twine around it

285
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
that's an awesome idea especially if you

286
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,360
want to be very very neat and careful

287
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
about it i'd highly recommend you go

288
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,399
with that

289
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,240
me personally i just like i like the

290
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,799
cannabis being

291
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,799
swished around in the butter or in the

292
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,679
oil that way it gets to every single

293
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,719
little inch and piece and i'll uh strain

294
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,039
it later through the cheesecloth

295
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,440
so um some recipes people will have it

296
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,278
wrapped up in a cheesecloth burrito

297
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,760
i just personally like this way better

298
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:17,838
ooh that's nice and mixed in

299
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,990
i'll bring you guys in for a close look

300
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,200
so

301
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,480
[Music]

302
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,920
all right

303
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
here it is in the crock pot

304
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,720
this is definitely submerged if i wanted

305
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,160
to i could add some more cannabis on top

306
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,079
of this

307
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,278
even if it's not decarbs remember what i

308
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:42,000
was talking about you get both benefits

309
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:45,039
thc a and thc

310
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,240
cbd a and cbd or if you've got a really

311
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:51,799
cool strain cbg a and cbg all right here

312
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,799
it is in the butter

313
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,958
that's looking really nice it's so close

314
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,919
to the top i would definitely say that

315
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,919
that

316
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,958
one ounce of of uh decarb cannabis

317
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,120
per

318
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:09,439
um eight ounces of butter is perfect but

319
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,200
in my opinion if i look in here and this

320
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,000
is just me

321
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,360
there's so much more room

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,360
more weed could go in here

323
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,279
so i'm gonna go ahead and and grind up

324
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,959
slightly decarb a little bit more

325
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,200
cannabis

326
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,759
probably another ounce because i just

327
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,320
feel like another ounce can fit in there

328
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:38,879
so let's just say if you had one ounce

329
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,879
of weed

330
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,039
and you wanted to do hold on i'm trying

331
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,879
to get my phone straight

332
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,719
let's just say you had one ounce of

333
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,838
wheat and you wanted to do

334
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,839
one um

335
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:56,159
maybe just one cup of oil instead of two

336
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,039
cups of oil okay but um i mean i got

337
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,159
plenty of weed it's october we've

338
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:05,278
harvested a bunch plus i i had a whole

339
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,278
bunch from a friend and that's what uh

340
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,958
i'm using to make this so

341
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,360
i'm just gonna go ahead and i mean my

342
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,119
turkey bags pretty clean

343
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,360
i'm gonna grind up some more cannabis

344
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,879
stick it in the oven decarbot for a

345
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,879
little while and when it's ready i'm

346
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,879
just going to put it back in here in the

347
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,799
meantime i'm just keeping an eye on this

348
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,399
as you can see i got my thermometer on

349
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,439
here

350
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,639
at the moment the butter is on a medium

351
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,959
high heat

352
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,198
and i'm just kind of watching it and and

353
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,599
making sure that this doesn't boil too

354
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,639
much i just want it to kind of stay nice

355
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
and warm

356
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,600
and i'm gonna let this cook for four

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,600
hours i'm gonna let this cook for four

358
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,278
hours but i'm here hanging out in the

359
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,600
kitchen all day and i'll be keeping an

360
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,519
eye on it doing like this

361
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,839
just mixing it around and stirring it

362
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,120
just a little bit

363
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,440
being very very very careful

364
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,078
because this bowl is so small but hey

365
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,320
it's all i got what can you do

366
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,919
all right um i'll bring you guys back in

367
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,680
a little bit later when probably we're

368
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,278
about halfway through these uh four

369
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,120
hours

370
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,480
all right friends

371
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,600
so

372
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,480
round two

373
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,320
i got another ounce of leafy carved i'm

374
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,039
going to go ahead and put it here in the

375
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,040
crock pot

376
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,600
that's really good well one thing you

377
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,078
really want to be careful when you're

378
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
de-carving weed and cooking it and the

379
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,759
oil or butter

380
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,279
is uh you want to make sure your windows

381
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,799
are open

382
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,360
because your house is going to get

383
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,359
cranky

384
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,638
so just be careful that also

385
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,120
if you're in your kitchen like any

386
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,759
articles of clothing it's going to smell

387
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,278
all over you all day long so be careful

388
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,879
where you're walking into probably

389
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,240
wouldn't want to go anywhere near a

390
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,919
police station smelling this good

391
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,079
all right so

392
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,039
now in my crock pot this is exactly the

393
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:00,559
consistency i'm looking for i got two

394
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:04,078
cups of oil two ounces of weed one

395
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:06,958
spoonful of sapphire oil or sunflower

396
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:10,399
oil it's a legend

397
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:13,679
if you want to have this recipe then one

398
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:17,039
cup of oil one ounce of weed

399
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,519
half of a spoonful of sapphire oil or

400
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,439
sunflower oil some type of legend

401
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,759
this is much nicer this is starting to

402
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,800
get to a nice thick

403
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,800
ratio it's like an equal ratio in my

404
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,838
opinion of oil

405
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,000
to cannabis i guess that also depends on

406
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,639
the potency you're kind of looking for

407
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,120
but me if i could put more cannabis in i

408
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,240
would so i got to be careful not to put

409
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
too much

410
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,799
butter is looking on point staying nice

411
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,480
and thick i'm just giving it a quick

412
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,559
little stir

413
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,480
you know i come in here and i just check

414
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,919
on it and i make sure that the water

415
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,519
underneath is looking good

416
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:59,439
so i got water in this pot and um

417
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,600
it's sort of boiling just a little bit

418
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,839
of boiling not too crazy

419
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,480
my heat on the stove is at medium so

420
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,880
we're looking really good but let's just

421
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,000
say while i'm checking on these and

422
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,079
stirring every 5-10 minutes if i come

423
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,599
and look here and this water level is

424
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,078
getting too low

425
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,480
then very carefully and only off of the

426
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,438
side i'm going to pour just a little bit

427
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,439
more water in here

428
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,240
just a little bit at a time

429
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,400
that way that water level stays nice and

430
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,679
boiling it's mainly the steam off of it

431
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,440
that you're trying to get that's going

432
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,440
to keep this nice and melted without

433
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,240
overcooking it so that's why they want

434
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,960
you to use a double boiler and

435
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,160
make one if you have to in my case so

436
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,440
let's get a nice close-up

437
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
here is the oil

438
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,080
i'm gonna stir it around

439
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,559
okay so see how like the the

440
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,200
cannabis is just sitting there right at

441
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,960
the very edge

442
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,360
you could smash it down a little bit if

443
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,319
you want to that also works i also like

444
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,719
to scrape the sides of the bowl after i

445
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,240
stir it to make sure that the cannabis

446
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,240
goes down

447
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,919
i've also decided to start using two

448
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,759
different spatulas one for the butter

449
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,320
one for the oil

450
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,798
and here's the butter nice nice and

451
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:31,599
thick with this consistency of

452
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,599
cannabis to butter water ratio

453
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,400
so i just give it a a little stir just

454
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,000
like that just to kind of move things

455
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,919
around

456
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,119
that way things don't just quite settle

457
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,280
in one spot or settle on the bottom

458
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,959
same thing about getting these edges

459
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:50,798
down to get all the cannabis in there

460
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
okay

461
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:56,079
so basically that's what i'm gonna do

462
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,279
for the next few hours

463
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,319
keep an eye

464
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,399
stir

465
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,639
windows open we're good

466
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,480
okay we're back just checking in on

467
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,200
these and stirring them up a little bit

468
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,839
smelling really nice just stir this one

469
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,840
all together

470
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
this one i'm noticing the water level is

471
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,240
getting very low

472
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,840
don't forget to constantly check that

473
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,359
water level you don't want it to run out

474
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,918
of water

475
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:29,119
so very carefully i'm just pouring some

476
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,120
new water in the bottom

477
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,798
not too much if you heard that

478
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,798
the temperature went down so the water

479
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,839
is no longer boiling right now because i

480
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,679
had just added colder water to the mix

481
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,918
so i'm doing it about a cup at a time

482
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,840
just adding a cup at a time of water

483
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,080
it'll take one minute and then it'll get

484
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,079
back to boiling again

485
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,918
and then stir this up in the butter this

486
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,918
one's real nice and thick i like it

487
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,720
so that's all i'm going to constantly be

488
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,119
doing this

489
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,798
adding water stirring

490
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,319
stirring

491
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,759
i'll come back here like every 15

492
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,960
minutes just to keep an eye on

493
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,200
everything and make sure we're still

494
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,519
running smooth which is great because i

495
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,360
tend to run out of water here about

496
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,079
every 20 minutes or so so i've always

497
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,319
had to keep refilling

498
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,558
and i could already hear it like

499
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,720
starting to bubble again so so far we're

500
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,200
doing great i'm just staying on top of

501
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,360
it i wrote down my hours so i know what

502
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,519
time i need to uh come back and turn

503
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,119
everything off will be about 2 30 my

504
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,720
time

505
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,199
and i'll bring you guys back on when

506
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,679
it's time to string all right friends i

507
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,679
think we're all ready to go ahead and

508
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,280
strain out our oils

509
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,759
um i'm gonna do my coconut oil first i

510
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,119
like having one of these bowls that has

511
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,400
a um

512
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:53,439
a special lip to pour it out

513
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,919
so i'm gonna get a strainer like this

514
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,159
and place it over

515
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,400
and then i also have some cheese cloth

516
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,039
right here you get like the unbleached

517
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,159
kind

518
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,158
pour that on top

519
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,279
it's still a little hot let me grab some

520
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:11,279
gloves

521
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,919
wait

522
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,000
all right let's dump this in

523
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,679
[Music]

524
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
well it helps if i take that

525
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,038
there off go

526
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,360
you could wait for this to cool off if

527
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,440
you don't want to grab it while it's hot

528
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,678
i would actually uh highly recommend

529
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,679
that

530
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,079
so i'm just very carefully pouring all

531
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:51,359
of it in including the cannabis

532
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:55,599
material that's still in there

533
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:57,119
and while i'm holding this with one arm

534
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,158
and if this is too heavy for you it

535
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,759
might help if you have a friend

536
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,400
and i'm going to use my

537
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,679
my spatula to scrape all of the stuff

538
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,679
off the sides of the bowl

539
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,720
and put it in here

540
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,679
with the cannabis oil uh this part's

541
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,000
actually pretty easy

542
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,120
uh you only need to really uh

543
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,200
strain it like this once

544
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,000
when you're done you put your

545
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,679
cannabis oil in the mason jar

546
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,798
wait for it to cool off and you could

547
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,798
store it in the fridge

548
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,879
another thing that i like doing

549
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,960
especially if i'm using

550
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,919
what did i do with it oh especially if

551
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,200
i'm using like this kind of coconut oil

552
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,440
i like grabbing these little packets

553
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,400
i like grabbing these little packets

554
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,679
because

555
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
they're uh you can find them at the

556
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,360
store they're for like uh sauces or

557
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,919
something like that

558
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,839
but if i was to store my after it's

559
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,919
cooled down of course i could store it

560
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,519
in here put these in the freezer and

561
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,200
anytime i want to make a recipe with

562
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,839
some coconut oil i just pull out one of

563
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,279
these so those are pretty cool if you

564
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,959
wanted to do that

565
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,918
now

566
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,919
very carefully

567
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,480
let that sit for a few minutes i'm just

568
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,479
going to tie this up

569
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,760
and uh

570
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,599
this

571
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,279
um

572
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,599
i don't usually like

573
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,519
squeeze squeeze it out you know what i

574
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,439
mean i just um

575
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,599
let it sit for a while

576
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,120
and drip and and maybe i might push on

577
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:45,918
it just a little bit but not too much

578
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:49,119
and um when all the oil has came out of

579
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,559
here this can still be reused for other

580
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,678
purposes

581
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,480
um

582
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,080
what i typically do if i'm not needing

583
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,919
it immediately and i want to save it for

584
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,759
another day is i'll put it in a ziploc

585
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,159
bag after it's cooled of course i put it

586
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,879
in a ziploc bag stick in the freezer if

587
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,640
i wanted to reuse it um

588
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
one thing people can do is like put it

589
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
on an area that's aching like if your

590
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,038
back's really aching you could put it on

591
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,839
there

592
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,000
or um i would soak it like in a bath if

593
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,678
i wanted to take like a foot bath you

594
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,240
know i mean just soak your bath in some

595
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,440
hot water and then and then put this in

596
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,200
there

597
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,000
and then the bottom of your feet can

598
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,278
absorb what was left in this

599
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,240
um

600
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:33,440
but yeah that's how i do this so you see

601
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,400
how i don't wrap it up like a burrito

602
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,640
before in this cheesecloth i just like

603
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,080
swirling it all around and then putting

604
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,159
it through the cheesecloth so

605
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,839
that's dripping but i do want to show

606
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,840
you guys what it'll look like in the jar

607
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,558
this could take a while

608
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:59,519
then it's a lot easier to take this

609
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,759
and pour it in your

610
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,319
jar wherever you want to store it

611
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,400
um here's an easy little hint

612
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,918
say if you're using one of those smaller

613
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,400
bottles of oil like the um extra virgin

614
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,799
olive oil after it's cooled pour it back

615
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,798
into that bottle

616
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,240
so here is this nice and dark

617
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,960
this because of the mct coconut oil that

618
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,839
i used that will always be in a liquid

619
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,840
form

620
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,679
all right i'm going to put that off to

621
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,678
the side

622
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,798
get every last inch okay now

623
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,798
let's do the one for the butter

624
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,840
with the butter one i'm using one of

625
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,679
these

626
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,240
glass dishes it's

627
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,320
oven safe

628
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,558
so i'm going to put that

629
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,558
there

630
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,880
clean this off

631
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,880
put the strainer right on top of here

632
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,000
well my strain obviously kind of wants

633
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,720
to come down a little bit so i'm going

634
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,119
to prop it up on something

635
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,278
that works

636
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,839
get my piece of cheesecloth for the

637
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:25,839
butter

638
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,200
and is this hot

639
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,278
no i'll let it cool off a bit

640
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,038
so i'm going to grab that very carefully

641
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,880
as to not

642
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:49,038
hurt myself or spill too much

643
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,360
and i'm going to let the butter

644
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,359
go through here

645
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,879
the thing about the butter is since we

646
00:26:53,359 --> 00:27:01,278
added some water to it

647
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,440
um the water is still kind of in here so

648
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:06,159
we put it in this special dish here

649
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,960
because it's got a lid i could use i

650
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:12,720
could put this dish in the fridge

651
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,759
and let it cool for about two hours

652
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,839
and then i'll come back later and

653
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,839
the butter will separate and come to the

654
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,839
top and the water will be at the bottom

655
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:27,038
so

656
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,558
i've seen people squeeze this out too

657
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,159
maybe this one you might need to squeeze

658
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,440
it because maybe the butter just kind of

659
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,440
doesn't want to come out

660
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,359
so let me show you what this one looks

661
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,720
like

662
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,398
very carefully because it's still

663
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,240
dripping

664
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:51,519
so you see that

665
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,200
you could kind of already see a

666
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,679
separation starting to happen right

667
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,679
there huh

668
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,960
i'mma let this drip for a few minutes

669
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,880
i'll probably end up squeezing

670
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,319
the most of the butter out and then i

671
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,200
tie up the top

672
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:12,558
and then i'll put um this and the other

673
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:16,000
one in a ziploc bag after they've cooled

674
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:18,000
this guy right here

675
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,759
i'll put a lid on it and then i'll stick

676
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,679
it in the fridge for two hours and i'll

677
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,720
show you guys what that separation looks

678
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,600
like

679
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,120
so

680
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,278
we are done

681
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,278
with our coconut oil it's perfect i'm

682
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,679
just gonna let it sit with the

683
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,839
lid off and let it cool

684
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,200
and we're gonna wait a few minutes for

685
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,798
the butter and then we're gonna stick

686
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,880
the butter one in the fridge and then

687
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,879
that one will come back to it later so

688
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:46,000
we're gonna put on some gloves for this

689
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,278
part because as we squeeze the butter

690
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,880
out

691
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:53,919
your um skin can very easily absorb that

692
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,919
butter and thc

693
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,159
so i'm going to put on some gloves and

694
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:04,080
squeeze all the oil out not earth butter

695
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,159
i'm not trying to squeeze too hard

696
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,278
but i i do want to get all that butter

697
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,240
out

698
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,240
all right there we go

699
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,719
i'm gonna tie this one up that could be

700
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:16,719
uh saved for later

701
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,559
butterfingers thing

702
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,240
all right let me show you what it looks

703
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,240
like

704
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,439
all right we're back

705
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,360
this has been in the fridge for a couple

706
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,200
hours

707
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,199
you see how it's separated

708
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,119
so very carefully

709
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,000
i'm gonna try and get just the butter

710
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,000
part out

711
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:31,599
without splashing it back on my face

712
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,759
all right let's see if that worked

713
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:37,719
there we go

714
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,720
so i'm lifting it up

715
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:46,240
oh look at that

716
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,240
nice thick sheet of cannabis butter

717
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:55,278
i'm gonna let this sit on a paper towel

718
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,278
but just to give you an up close

719
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,480
still dripping everywhere i don't want

720
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,558
to drip all over my kitchen but

721
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
you see that

722
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,158
it's just kind of like a nice

723
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,759
thin sheet

724
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,080
of butter

725
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,000
i'm gonna put it on a plate with a paper

726
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:16,960
towel just like that that way the paper

727
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,278
towel can absorb the water

728
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,640
this leftover bit right here which is

729
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,159
mainly water

730
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,880
you could go ahead

731
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,799
and do that same double boiler method we

732
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,480
just did earlier pouring this liquid

733
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:32,480
back into there and watching um

734
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,000
watching the whole thing cook again

735
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,480
you'll strain it all over through a

736
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,640
cheesecloth one

737
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,240
you'll strain it through a cheesecloth

738
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,960
one more time

739
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,038
and then um it'll separate again and

740
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,679
then you'll you'll keep the very last

741
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,919
sheet of the butter on top

742
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,919
so

743
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,599
this had absorbed most of the moisture

744
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,558
here's this

745
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,558
nice can of butter

746
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,839
this is my other

747
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:07,278
oil we had made today this has been

748
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,959
stored in the fridge for um

749
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,440
about three hours

750
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,120
so still liquidy you see

751
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,159
i can keep it stored in the fridge and

752
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,639
they'll last a very long time um

753
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,799
definitely six months they can last

754
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,799
longer than that uh i just highly

755
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,038
recommend that at least you use your

756
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,079
medicine within six months

757
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,319
um

758
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,798
then like i was saying about that other

759
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,558
uh coconut the one that uh gets solid

760
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:34,798
when it's chilled

761
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:34,798
see

762
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,960
this is what i mean it stays solid until

763
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,639
you warm it up

764
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,038
all right i hope you guys had a

765
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,759
wonderful time making cannabis butter

766
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:48,240
and cannabis oil i don't think anybody

767
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,119
has ever done both things on one video

768
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,919
so

769
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:54,398

770
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,320
please give this video a thumbs up leave

771
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:57,839
a comment let me know if there's any

772
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,839
other different methods that you like to

773
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,319
do a little bit differently on how you

774
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,079
make oil or how you make butter

775
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,960
um in the future i'm going to upload

776
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,199
some videos about how to use

777
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,519
your oil to make cool things like

778
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,038
um

779
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,960
well honestly i just like making

780
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,679
brownies um i also like using it to make

781
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,159
a

782
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,559
cream and stuff for the skin

783
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,440
and this kind of oil actually i like

784
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,678
using this one to put into um little

785
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,120
capsules so some people like to take

786
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,399
capsules

787
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,719
um

788
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,678
