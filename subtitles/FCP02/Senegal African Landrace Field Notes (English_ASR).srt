1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:07,259
Audi okay next field notes we're in our

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:10,439
African sativa section now so this is

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,620
Senegal this is from Senegal this is in

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:16,858
African land race and uh

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,919
this and it's October 23rd and this one

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,779
I would say these are getting very

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000
close to harvest time we may be

8
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,018
harvesting uh within like five days or

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,879
so

10
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,959
um but I'm really impressed with the

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:33,000
Senegal as a uh potential uh production

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,640
plant because it really actually has

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,659
very thick chunky colas it actually

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:43,558
finished October 23rd is not

15
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:45,359
a crazy finish time and uh yeah it's not

16
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:46,079
super late

17
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,058
um

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,899
nice chunk

19
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:50,899
and the smell

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,840
it's just all different kinds of

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,820
perfumes and astringent sort of mothball

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,399
cleaner smells

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,000
um I wouldn't say really sweet I smell

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,000
like one more time

25
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:11,298
yeah it's like soft

26
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,298
but kind of uh

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,438
yeah like a cleaner kind of smell with

28
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,239
some perfume in there and then here's

29
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,779
the other one from Senegal so we'll take

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,819
a look at this uh this one has very

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,219
similar just a little more uh maybe

32
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,219
slightly more torpedo spear shape

33
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,779
uh this one has the more pleasant

34
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,239
African sativa sort of grassy actually

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,400
it very much smells like this may sound

36
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,938
a little weird but um

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,200
if you cut a parsnip or a carrot but

38
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:50,419
really a parsnip and a fresh astringent

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,420
parsnip smell that is actually very

40
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:57,420
that's that's the smell that's coming

41
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,060
off of here a freshly cut uh raw parsnip

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,280
anyway again this could make a nice

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,820
production oh yeah actually a nice

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,580
chunky sort of modern looking colas and

45
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:11,159
it's actually finishing up uh October

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,800
23rd so I'd say by Halloween we'll be

47
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,199
harvesting though so uh very excited to

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,800
sample so anyway Senegal

49
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,799
cool
