1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,400
boom part three so now you can see that

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,359
lemon Tha Larry Mexican black how much

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,199
of this has come back right fully

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:15,599
developed ready to go probably got you

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:18,039
know 10 functional cuts on it so ready

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,039
to be turned into something but I wanted

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,640
to show you the different pacing and so

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,039
you can see how this one came back so

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,000
well and we talked about that more

10
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,759
tropical influence gives you a a more

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,439
plasticity better better recovery and we

12
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,200
come over here and this is a Skittle to

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,719
the red Leb Puck and you can see you

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,520
know look at the the flower material

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,520
just completely breaking down but you

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,280
can see we have all this new material

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,000
clonable stock so we succeeded here and

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,840
then we come over to that cherry pie gny

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,198
and finally we have some material here

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,840
that's popped out but if we were to base

21
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:54,599
the recovery off of this one then we

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,879
would we would have said hey this one

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,879
and this one would uh been have been

24
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,759
excluded but you can see the pacing on

25
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,159
it to where one of is fully ready to

26
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,280
give me about 10

27
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,319
cuts this one right here is just the

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,280
beginning of maybe you know a single

29
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,959
Scion popping off but it's just a a

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,920
matter of being patient with the work

31
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,478
and allowing the plant to really dictate

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,680
its pace of return and now what we have

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,560
is the

34
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,840
recovered the recovered and the

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,400
recovered all right so hope I gave you

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,200
guys some info on uh regrows and about

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,200
being patient with the process
