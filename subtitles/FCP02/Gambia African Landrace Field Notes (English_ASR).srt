1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,460
hey another African sativa field notes

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:10,199
here this is Gambia so we'll need to

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,500
we'll pull up a map and show you where

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,959
Gambia is so uh but it's October 23rd

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,579
and this one is actually very close to

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:23,640
being finished uh this has more of the

7
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:26,579
traditional African sativa really sort

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,618
of fluffy little Spears going on but the

9
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,000
hairs are all starting to Brown up quite

10
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,159
a bit

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,899
um we only grew one of these plants this

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,578
year we had they were tougher to

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,179
germinate

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,100
we do have seeds though to back it up

15
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,039
and uh

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,620
this one just kind of has a

17
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,960
sort of

18
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,019
funner kind of smell

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,020
um

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,480
slightly like uh

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,759
old school bubble gum like Bazooka

22
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,538
bubble gums or that spice bubble gum

23
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,539
smell

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,359
and kind of like uh

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,100
Fabrics off of her like the old pink

26
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:14,519
fabric softener from like the 70s and

27
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,679
80s there was Liquid I don't like that

28
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,719
substance in a bottle but when it's

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,979
coming from a cannabis plant

30
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:26,459
smells interesting so anyway Gambia very

31
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:28,618
very cool and we'll be harvesting this

32
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:31,019
uh before Halloween so right now it's

33
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:35,099
October 23rd but cool Plant very

34
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:37,519
primitive primal almost bush bush plant

35
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:37,519
okay
