1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,319
we're going to do some strain

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,120
history yeah every week right we're g to

3
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:10,199
pick different cuts different strains

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,758
different lines and we're going to chat

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,678
about rather than like I've done it in

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,240
the past but sort of like by breeders

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,439
and a much deeper wider thing we're

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,278
gonna take them in little segments

9
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:24,118
little little little chunks little

10
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:26,879
chunks right and um you

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:31,960
know crybaby and I went back and forth

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,960
on like where to start okay and so

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:40,238
um I guess the best way to say it is

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:44,000
this okay is that I want to tell you all

15
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:46,479
that cannabis history is hard for a few

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,679
reasons one is because we were one is

17
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,558
because we were illegal for a long time

18
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:54,439
and so things were in the shadows for a

19
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:57,238
bit okay two is that memories are

20
00:00:54,439 --> 00:01:00,399
imperfect and people often

21
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,399
disagree okay and so all these stories

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,759
that we're going to tell and all these

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,359
things that we're going to say over the

24
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,719
coming months about these various

25
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,359
strains and different things are the

26
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,239
information as best we know it to the

27
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,239
best of our knowledge okay to the best

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,839
of our knowledge they're all and and

29
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,000
it's so it's an organic living thing

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,920
right a a living document if you will

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,840
that is very open to people coming out

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,118
and changing it or adding Nuance to it

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,159
or people coming out of the shadows and

34
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,719
adding CL verification to things we

35
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:38,600
didn't know about or whatever you know

36
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,438
and so what we decided to do is um you

37
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,118
know we're going to talk a lot about

38
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,718
like old Holland and Neville and you

39
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,040
know and and various different seed

40
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:48,478
stuff because that's sort of like the

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,000
basis for all of it but yeah crybaby

42
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,078
thought that we should talk about um

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,519
something uh at least first that

44
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,679
originated with me I agree there's not

45
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,718
that many things so I'm going to tell

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,920
you

47
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:10,038
I'm gonna tell you the story of the meno

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,199
Tada okay um as best I know it even

49
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,119
right and then I'm want to tell you a

50
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,560
little bit about what what it's done um

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,640
different people that have gotten it

52
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,959
various Pathways it's taken all that

53
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:25,199
different types of stuff right

54
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,920
so the story starts with um I was fresh

55
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,719
in meno I hadn't been here very long it

56
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:34,000
was late 90s okay and I had a buddy

57
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,878
who was a glass blower all right and

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,479
glass blowing was and its infancy enough

59
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,158
that we were just starting to learn that

60
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:45,238
when you fume gold and silver and heavy

61
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:48,878
metals onto molten glass it could kind

62
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,400
of be unhealthy for you right and so my

63
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:56,479
friend lived in Willet and he he his

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,239
first his first grow his first um glass

65
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,959
blowing shop literally had a cheap box

66
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,360
fan stop stuck in the

67
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,959
window okay that was that was his uh

68
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:12,519
ventilation Tech all right so we found

69
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:15,280
this old man all right who was a HVAC

70
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,080
professional okay his whole life was

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
about

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,239
airflow you know venting uh tubes you

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,640
know uh hoods all that different types

74
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,239
of stuff and he was old and sick so we

75
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,158
hired him hey can you come into this

76
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,840
garage this shop and can you build us a

77
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,679
ventilation system that will keep my

78
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,519
friend

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,719
safe right he was old and poor and so he

80
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,959
agreed okay so he comes in we paid him

81
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,359
we paid him a chunk of money uh well you

82
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:48,680
know he was it when I moved here uh

83
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,640
Mendo was not very economically po it

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,000
was it was it was in a depression for

85
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,399
lack of a better way to put it there was

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,799
a lot of rural poverty and stuff like

87
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,560
that around here right sure so and

88
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,640
everyone was affected by it and so he

89
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,840
was building this thing you know um

90
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,878
various duct work and and hoods and all

91
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,239
that different types of stuff and in the

92
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:14,878
process of talking to him I discovered

93
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:18,040
that he had cancer okay so that affected

94
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,399
me pretty greatly because at the time my

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,199
ex uh she we that's part of the reason

96
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,319
why we moved to Mendo is that she was

97
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,040
undergoing

98
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,639
chemotherapy Mena uh California had just

99
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,400
passed 215 about a year and some change

100
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,918
before right

101
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,560
and um it was the first place in America

102
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:38,159
that you could have cannabis for certain

103
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:43,560
ailments and not just be seen as like a

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,880
a total uh a a total criminal right so I

105
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,519
felt bad for dude and I was doing

106
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,600
relatively well for myself at the time

107
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,000
and I was young so I ended up giving him

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,120
like a quarter pound of weed and a chunk

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,439
of hash to help with his nausea with

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
chemo okay and he didn't have anything

111
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,719
to give me back he couldn't pay me or

112
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,120
anything like that so I didn't care I

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,440
just said here you can have it it's just

114
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,079
a bonus for helping us we're super

115
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:10,160
thankful right didn't think much of it a

116
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,319
few weeks later um when he's finishing

117
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,720
up the the ducting and and the putting

118
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,839
in of the the ventilation system or

119
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,120
whatever he comes back and he's got this

120
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,638
medicine medicine canister um that had a

121
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,079
couple seeds in it and he goes you know

122
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,800
I used to grow in the

123
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,879
70s um and he's like I've got some old

124
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,520
seeds in my closet here's a couple of

125
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:35,079
them and uh uh it's all I have for you

126
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,758
so I was super thankful for it whatever

127
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:41,758
I didn't expect much of it but I

128
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,800
um I uh I went home and I sprouted them

129
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:49,000
and whatever I got both of them popped

130
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:54,520
and I was growing them up and

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,519
um I got him about two feet tall

132
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,439
okay this this sounds kind of dumb but I

133
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,199
had a I was growing in bedrooms at the

134
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,399
time uh indoor at least and I had a

135
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,759
friend come in I was moving my veg and I

136
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,679
had a friend come in and help me set

137
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,240
stuff up and move stuff around so we

138
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,840
hung a few lights and we some tables and

139
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,240
we painted this room and da D anyway so

140
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,159
we do all that stuff we get it all built

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,918
we move the plants in there okay I come

142
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,919
in the next day and there's this big

143
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,639
plant that's dead on the floor right and

144
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,038
one of the one of the lights back then

145
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,360
the hoods were pretty heavy and they

146
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,159
were metal and they were kind of

147
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,038
sharpish one of the um he had missed a

148
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,400
stud on one of the hooks so one of the

149
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,318
hooks had come down and

150
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,679
swung and chopped off one of my two

151
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,360
menop plants at the

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,199
base all right Y and it was the I had a

153
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,240
male and a female and that was the male

154
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,280
so at the time I was super pumped that

155
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,840
um the the female didn't die right

156
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,359
and

157
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:09,959
uh so I take this female and I Bloom it

158
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,960
out with other stuff that I was growing

159
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,680
and it was unbelievably purple and it

160
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:20,560
smelled wild and it smelled okay it

161
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,560
smelled absolutely wild and I was like

162
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:28,079
oh my God right so I took this I got

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,598
some dried flour of it okay and I took

164
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:34,719
it to uh homie and I was like what is

165
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,680
this and he was like dude I didn't even

166
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,319
know I had this anymore I thought I gave

167
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,079
you something totally else okay this and

168
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,720
he told me the

169
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:46,439
only the only uh the only story I have

170
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,440
to it is he said this is the only purple

171
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:53,478
weed I ever grew and I grew this in the

172
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:57,279
summer of 1977 in Koval which is a very

173
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:59,639
remote town in medino County all right

174
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,318
and at the time this is 1998 is or

175
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:06,879
whatever so I was

176
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,280
22 and the seeds were a

177
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,520
21 they were about a year younger than

178
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:16,519
me you know well lucked out and I lucked

179
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,240
out really it was pure luck okay um I

180
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,799
never really got very much more

181
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,960
information from him and sadly he died

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,560
of cancer um within three or four months

183
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,439
of that time right um so he was passed

184
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,000
and

185
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,479
so uh you know and basically he lived

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
like people don't know this about meno

187
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,560
but like meno has a lot of Hills right

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,480
and he lived on the northeast

189
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,039
side of a mountain in a cabin okay and

190
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
if you live on the northeast side you

191
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,360
don't really get and you're in the woods

192
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,120
you don't really get a lot of sun right

193
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,800
right so he basically had his little

194
00:08:52,120 --> 00:09:00,320
seeds stored in a cold

195
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:03,039
Closet in his little house forever okay

196
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,760
and you know be that as it may so that's

197
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:10,919
the story that I have behind

198
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:13,958
it okay um now funnily enough strangely

199
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,319
enough so we're growing this stuff out

200
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,278
and

201
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,920
it's vibrantly purple looks like nothing

202
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:23,000
else on the looks like nothing else on

203
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:26,479
the market smells incredible the only

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,480
weakness to it was that

205
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,159
it flowered really fast but it was kind

206
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,560
of light in the

207
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,120
bag you know like it like the first

208
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,439
month you're growing it you were like oh

209
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,839
my God this is going to be the biggest

210
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,320
yielding thing in my

211
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,160
garden and then the second month other

212
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,360
things catch up to it and it ends up not

213
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:49,519
being all that great a yield and it's

214
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:54,800
pretty lower on the level of

215
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,600
THC okay but that actually is one of the

216
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:01,120
components that makes me think that his

217
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:05,440
story is true okay because when most

218
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:09,919
stuff in the late 70s and early 80s

219
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:13,079
was high single digits to low teens THC

220
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:16,838
yeah that was actually really normal

221
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:21,799
yeah for that era that was kind of like

222
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,839
you know I mean 14 15 16% was like crazy

223
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:26,319
rare

224
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,920
potent okay you know and and I'll I'll

225
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,519
tell some cool stories about it or

226
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,120
whatever

227
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,399
so uh like you know how sometimes on the

228
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,039
base of stems right you'll get like a CX

229
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:44,039
that forms yeah right sometimes with the

230
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:45,078
Mendo P that KX would be so dark purple

231
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,278
okay I don't know if you can see my

232
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,159
fingers that you could take that KX and

233
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:54,720
go like this and there would be like a

234
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:56,958
purple stain on your finger to the point

235
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,120
[ __ ] stain on your hands to the point

236
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:03,679
where we used to joke that um we could

237
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:09,480
make ink out of it or something he could

238
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:12,078
right and so I kept it around okay and

239
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,000
um four or five years later three years

240
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,719
later four well probably more like four

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,720
or five the purple craze

242
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,399
hit where Urkel and you know things that

243
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,639
became known as as purple Urkel

244
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,759
Granddaddy Purple uh Grape Ape Platinum

245
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,480
all these different things started

246
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,519
booming Mendo was part of that it wasn't

247
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,278
as potent as the other things so it

248
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,919
didn't catch on quite as much and it

249
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,799
didn't spread as far okay um but what it

250
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:42,479
turns

251
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:44,759
out in a nutshell is that and I also

252
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,680
think this sort of ties into the fact

253
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,480
that it's probably really old right is

254
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:53,759
that it's that one plant that I had its

255
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,320
genetic diversity is really

256
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,759
wide yeah like really wide okay I know

257
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,440
we've seen the on tons of them tons of

258
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,838
so if you grow out and I've seen we've

259
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,800
done this in a number of times if you

260
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:10,480
grow out like a few hundred

261
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:12,879
s1s okay you will get tall plants short

262
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,278
plants you'll get plants that are all

263
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,278
green you'll get plants that all the

264
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,240
leaves are green and all the and all the

265
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,759
weed is purple you'll get you'll get

266
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,320
weed that's lavender you'll get weed

267
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,480
that's pitch black you'll get weed

268
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,199
that's

269
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:34,440
burgundy probably 10% of them smell

270
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:36,240
skunky probably another 10% maybe 5% 5

271
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,320
to 10 smell

272
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,278
cushy the vast majority probably 60 70%

273
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:48,320
have some kind of like incense floral

274
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:49,559
nog Champa type hashish or that I can't

275
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
this is where he's laughing at me

276
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:55,518
because my the the greatest weakness I

277
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,480
have in canana is describing Aroma

278
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,278
accurately right and I'm you're fine

279
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,680
you're fine chatting with Mr I'm just

280
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,320
telling you my

281
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,599
caveman

282
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:11,519
sense of what it was okay and

283
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,399
then around that time uh so that was

284
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,759
that was late 90s and then a few years

285
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:22,278
later I met this dude named Jason

286
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:24,838
King okay and um I met him at um at

287
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,278
Eddie Lep's Farm in Lake County which is

288
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,920
a whole different story or or whatever

289
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:35,519
and Jason was trying to go around the

290
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:38,639
triangle and photograph and make blurbs

291
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:43,078
about a bunch of the old school heirloom

292
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,278
weed okay that was around then and him

293
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:49,919
and I became pretty good friends then

294
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:51,958
all right and I helped him um uh go

295
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,479
around mesino and go around all these

296
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,758
places which at the time was like very

297
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,240
underground and very suspicious of

298
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:03,159
Outsiders right um and get sort of an

299
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,440
inn okay on all that different and with

300
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:07,360
different people that would never have

301
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,079
let him in the door sure so if you go

302
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:16,480
into the uh into the canab

303
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:18,479
Bible um the second one at least uh all

304
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,399
those pictures of the Mendo

305
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:26,600
P are from my garden

306
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,639
Tada right and that kind of made it a

307
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,159
bit more

308
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,480
famous obviously

309
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:37,278
um because it was it was it was raided

310
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,320
in there and uh you know and you know so

311
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:43,919
that kind of boosted it a little bit and

312
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,959
then there's another part of it where

313
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,000
uh my buddy

314
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:54,278
CSI

315
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,958
okay got a hold of uh this weird

316
00:14:54,278 --> 00:15:00,159
smelling burgundy

317
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,439
weed with some seeds in it

318
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,799
and he was blown away by its Aroma it

319
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,079
didn't smell like anything else he'd

320
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:10,120
ever smelled it was like reddish looking

321
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:15,479
and wild okay so he hunts it

322
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,600
down all right and he actually found

323
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,560
people that were friends of

324
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,240
mine okay because that's where it had

325
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,758
come from it was like he had to like hop

326
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,159
from this person to this person to this

327
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,079
person to this person but he ended up

328
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,600
kind of getting closer to me right and

329
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:34,198
he he got close enough to me

330
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,639
that those people told him the real

331
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,719
story right that I told just now

332
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,759
combined with like who I got it the old

333
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,160
man the cancer The Swinging down of the

334
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,159
you know and so what's funny is that at

335
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,519
that

336
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:52,039
point various people were lying to him

337
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,959
okay and telling him that they had bred

338
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:58,120
it and giving him a bunch of Guff right

339
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,039
so he ends up meeting me and I claim it

340
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,360
and I didn't realize at the time that it

341
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:04,480
was anything or that he had had three or

342
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,720
four other people that had claimed it

343
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,159
and so he asks me to tell what I knew

344
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,600
about it right so I start chatting about

345
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,159
it and I start telling him the story and

346
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,319
then I like sheepishly admit that we had

347
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:21,439
this error with this old ass super sharp

348
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,120
hydrarm hood that dude missed the stud

349
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,000
in my bedroom ceiling and the thing

350
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,318
swung down and killed it and

351
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,839
apparently that part of the T tale had

352
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:34,078
been told to him by his

353
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,360
friend and no one else had brought up

354
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,359
that little

355
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,639
tidbit right so he was like holy crap

356
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,639
this is the person that popped

357
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,720
it right because I had these weird

358
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,078
little

359
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:53,278
details that nobody else had speaking of

360
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:55,000
speaking of weird details um someone

361
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,720
asked has there ever been an essential

362
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,799
oil analysis from real Afghan or nepes

363
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,879
hash um not to the best of my knowledge

364
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,599
however I mean I'm sure lots of

365
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:08,240
Europeans could pull it off and I would

366
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,719
always be interested to see what some of

367
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,959
these old hashy you know insensi plans

368
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,279
like the menop show up on like a full

369
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,279
panel yeah compared to something like

370
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,879
actual traditional hash on a full panel

371
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,119
so so

372
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,360
I point to add to that in fact so when I

373
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,678
was going when I was going out to

374
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:33,759
Amsterdam quite a bit okay

375
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,240
um for a bit all I did was go to stores

376
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,279
and buy essentially what we would call

377
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,279
Today wck weed

378
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,918
wed but eventually I made friends and I

379
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:47,399
started getting weed and hash that was

380
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,520
too good to make it into the

381
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,160
shops better than W weed better than W

382
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:57,240
weed right and so a lot of people this

383
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,440
is you know in Amsterdam it's mostly a

384
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,079
hash culture and a lot of people don't

385
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,000
know this but a lot of a lot of The

386
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:05,960
Growers I think Yos Samy and stuff has

387
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,960
talked about it a lot of The Growers um

388
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,360
that were growing uh weed for like the

389
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,079
the coffee shops and stuff like that

390
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,240
were actually growing it for money and

391
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,399
they would take that money and they

392
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,599
would try to buy the best traditional

393
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,240
hash they could get their hands on which

394
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,158
was rare hard to find and the top

395
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,240
qualities literally never made it into

396
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:30,720
the shops because it was swooped up by

397
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,159
all the collectors before there so I met

398
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,400
this dude they call him the nose he's

399
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,919
still alive he's over there his name is

400
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,480
Steve he worked he grew for Neville

401
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,120
right and Steve had this collection of

402
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,360
different kinds of

403
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:46,558
hashish okay and apparently everyone's

404
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:48,839
favorite hash that they could get I mean

405
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,879
they had stuff they had Lebanese they

406
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,639
had Moroccan they had this they had that

407
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,760
but apparently the best hash their

408
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,320
favorite

409
00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:03,079
was um this nepes Temple balls

410
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:06,399
okay and they said the best hash that

411
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:09,359
was from Nepal was these nepes Temple

412
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,880
balls but it was westerners or Europeans

413
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,959
in this sense right Europeans going over

414
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,919
there and helping the farmers with

415
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,200
cleanliness and Purity and some of the

416
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,799
processes to keep it a little nicer for

417
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,159
export to the Dutch Market interesting

418
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:30,720
okay so that was sort of like like

419
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,080
nepales strains grown by nepes farmers

420
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,798
in their taah or whatever you know in

421
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,798
the high elevations and all this

422
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,240
different stuff or whatnot but then when

423
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,279
it comes to extracting and processing it

424
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
the Euros just added a little bit of

425
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,079
like

426
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,200
cleanliness to the processing and stuff

427
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:52,798
so I smoke this nepes Temple balls

428
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:57,319
okay and it is the only thing that I

429
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:59,599
have ever smoked all right that tasted

430
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,879
like the Mendo PE

431
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:05,038
yeah and I'm not saying that Mendo has

432
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,440
some unique flavor or anything like that

433
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,480
but what I am saying is that maybe for

434
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,120
whatever

435
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,159
reason meno p might be one of the only

436
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,038
things that

437
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:19,039
survived West with that flavor

438
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:21,558
profile and it's interesting

439
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,839
because it's not like it was absent

440
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:24,480
something that you and I have like

441
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:28,759
talked about and I've shown you before

442
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,240
is like if you I've gone through every

443
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:36,079
issue of High Times up until I guess

444
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,759
2005 or six and then like basically the

445
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,960
same with every other counterculture

446
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:46,359
magazine for cannabis you can find lots

447
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:49,240
of early stories of very very like bold

448
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:52,678
genetic purples in your region but

449
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,200
there's a timeline Gap you like I showed

450
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,880
you that picture that's like you know

451
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,159
that little kind of squat but like

452
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,120
hybrid Leaf looking purple thing in

453
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:06,400
Mendo in 81 I showed you the purple

454
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:09,959
skunk and all of that stuff from like

455
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,480
the like mid Sam days those photos and

456
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,919
stuff but like it's just all of those

457
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,679
thing things seem to just kind of

458
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:25,759
like go off the timeline at the same

459
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:28,120
time and as soon as you see like 85 86

460
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,319
and all of like articles and magazines

461
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:32,399
and stuff are mostly dominated by what's

462
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:36,200
happening with like the booming Dutch

463
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,640
Seed Market um it's like a lot of that

464
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,798
stuff was lost up until basically the

465
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,278
pre days of the purple craze

466
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,000
and it's strange obviously it wasn't all

467
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:49,278
lost and people had their own projects

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,240
and stuff but

469
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:54,480
like it's interesting how it came back

470
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,079
with like a Vengeance because it almost

471
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,880
seemed like at another point it was like

472
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:02,278
wow like even that old article on

473
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,840
Dolores is like wow look at this deep

474
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:07,880
purple alien weed [ __ ] right like I

475
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,599
think I didn't I didn't realize it when

476
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,520
I was young and going over there and

477
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:15,678
buying a bunch of seed from Amsterdam

478
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,759
how temporary availability is and how

479
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,759
things can you know and so it's like we

480
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:23,480
don't have a a huge plethora of things

481
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,079
you know from back in the day we have a

482
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:33,200
few things that have survived here and

483
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:34,759
there right and so you know um I so

484
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,120
that's kind of like that's kind of the

485
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,359
meno PE story and and like the Mendo PE

486
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,479
story like starts with me in the sense

487
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,719
that like I I cracked the seeds but it

488
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,200
also starts with this old man okay and

489
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,240
it also ties to you know late 70s 77

490
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,798
that's when he was talking about it that

491
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,159
is when with the hippie hashish trail

492
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,759
and stuff like that um a lot of early

493
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,000
Afghans and a lot of early hybrids from

494
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:04,400
that region started making their way to

495
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
California and Oregon sure in the mid to

496
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,759
late 70s that's when the sort of the

497
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,599
first wave because the first wave of

498
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:15,038
cannabis in America was pretty much

499
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:19,038
seeds from imported weed Mexico Panama

500
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:22,079
Colombia Jamaica Thailand perhaps you

501
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,240
know these different things and the

502
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,678
Afghans and the Afghan hybrids and stuff

503
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,759
those got made into hash so there

504
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:32,679
weren't free seeds with your purchase

505
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,079
right right and so and so the people on

506
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:38,278
the hippie hashish Trail they started

507
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,558
giving Afghans and Afghan hybrids to

508
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:42,798
people up and down the West Coast that

509
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,278
they were friends with you know

510
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,558
everything from like that's where the NL

511
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:48,919
thing started especially in Mendo and

512
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,678
humble where there's like very old you

513
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,159
know weed growing and stuff like that

514
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:57,000
people started getting a hold of that

515
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:59,080
kind of thing and you know and so you

516
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,519
know what's what's ended up happening

517
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:05,119
is that it turns out over time I I I

518
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:08,679
would say probably that like menop is a

519
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:12,079
premier breeding plant okay CSI used to

520
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:14,600
joke with me that like we could do a

521
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:17,599
giveaway of a bunch of

522
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:20,759
s1's and have people pick their

523
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,199
favorites and then have them post it and

524
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,919
there would be such variation in what

525
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,600
people picked right because there was

526
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,080
such a w there's a lot of s1's where

527
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,918
it's kind of like it's it's a lot more

528
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,519
narrow

529
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,960
right Mendo is one of the rare ones

530
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,759
where there's literally like dozens of

531
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,319
different ways you could go with

532
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:42,240
it okay yeah and you know it probably if

533
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,759
it was 20 or 25% THC it would probably

534
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,079
be like one of the most legendary

535
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,798
strains out there but it's like a

536
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,240
lighter High um but it has incredible

537
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:53,200
TPS incredible colors it's got a lot of

538
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:58,159
variation in it and it's it's really

539
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,200
neat um I mean I just Gabby uh you know

540
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,278
I think I told the story before but like

541
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,360
that's actually like one of the things

542
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,440
that cemented Gabby and I's friendship

543
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:09,119
was me and my my friend Shawn who sadly

544
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,558
passed uh gave him a joint of

545
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,038
menop and he hit me up and was like what

546
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:16,319
in the [ __ ] is that you know because it

547
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,679
was just so it was so different from

548
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:22,200
everything else that was out there um

549
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:25,759
and so like a lot of old plants um you

550
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,679
know I think its best attribute is the

551
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,640
ability that it's sort of like a time

552
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,278
capsule and that you can breed with it

553
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,640
and you're going back in time to an

554
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,640
earlier time long before all the

555
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,440
sameness came in long before all the

556
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,038
inbreeding and stuff with all the famous

557
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,000
cultivars that have happened in the last

558
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:46,200
15 or 20 years it's just from an earlier

559
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,759
time you know and it's really valuable

560
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,640
as as far as that goes and so um one of

561
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,158
the reasons why we decided to start with

562
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,520
the with the meno PE story is because

563
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,640
it's partially my story and it requires

564
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,960
less interpretation now a disclaimer

565
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,640
when it comes to all these stories you

566
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,360
can choose to believe as much or as

567
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,200
little of it as possible right um

568
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:12,240
because they are just stories it'll be

569
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,640
fun and um you know but uh oral

570
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,038
histories and stuff like that and

571
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,200
stories are are neat right and so we're

572
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:23,960
going to do basically every show we're

573
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,080
going to be picking strains clones lines

574
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,640
every time there's going to be a

575
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:31,519
reoccurring segment on strain history

576
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,278
yeah right and it can even get updated

577
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,960
if there's somebody that all you can

578
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,798
take audience suggestions you can also

579
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,480
take audience suggestions and even more

580
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,720
so than that if there happens to be an

581
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,399
audience member that we're talking about

582
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,480
some strain that they have a personal

583
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:51,439
friend or a connection to and they want

584
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,798
that person to like clarify or add you

585
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,480
know some some depth or some flavor to

586
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:57,519
the conversation about things that they

587
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,159
know it's more than welcome all this

588
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,839
stuff isn't meant to be definitive it's

589
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,399
meant to be to get information out there

590
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,918
for for younger people to educate some

591
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:09,359
people and to start a conversation about

592
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,600
the history of some of this stuff it

593
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:15,678
it's each person's truth as best they

594
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:19,918
remember it and the caveat here would be

595
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,919
as as calmly as you stated someone else

596
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,919
can come on and tell their truth from

597
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,159
their perspective that people uh are

598
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,159
nice to each other and don't start

599
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,120
slinging mud at each other well the

600
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,960
slinging mud thing which sometimes

601
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:35,199
happens this the slinging mud thing I

602
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,519
think boils down to two basic factors

603
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:42,159
when it comes to Kaa because we all came

604
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:45,798
out of the Shadows um being an OG if you

605
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,960
will okay A lot of times is tied into

606
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:52,000
did you happen to be lucky enough to

607
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,880
have some history with a famous strain

608
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,519
before it got famous sure we want to

609
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,000
hear your story oh you were involved you

610
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,079
were talking about this or that and so a

611
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,599
lot of times when it comes to history

612
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:07,480
okay history is always history is

613
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,000
history but then there's a bunch of

614
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,079
people that are like well how can I make

615
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,119
this history make me money or build my

616
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,278
rep or work for me right now right and

617
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,918
so capitalize on someone else's story a

618
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:23,119
lot of history is like I'm gonna do this

619
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,880
tale that paints me in a really good

620
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:29,239
light you

621
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,640
know and um you know and so one of the

622
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,919
interesting things about menop is that

623
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,399
it's such a unique smell and Aroma that

624
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,880
almost everything we found so far um

625
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:42,359
that smells like it or comes like it

626
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,320
ends up being descended from it and I'm

627
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,319
not going to like really dive into all

628
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,319
that uh about where it went and the

629
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,678
various things there's a lot of info we

630
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:53,158
could get into in the future um you know

631
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,120
and it's not really necessar it's not

632
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,480
like even mine really it's like this old

633
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,038
man gave it to me because I gave him an

634
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,278
act of

635
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,200
right and he gave it to me and I popped

636
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:07,319
it and it just it was just sitting in

637
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:10,278
his closet and uh you know so there's

638
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:10,278
there's that
