no scratch fairy was produced as that

116
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,079
what was it like i mean those guys are

117
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,078
all pretty different i mean first of all

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,918
you guys at least scratch perry we got

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,319
chris blackwell

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,680
bob marley oh you say

00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,040
lee scratch perry produced the bell

122
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
marley toons yeah bob marley

123
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,959
executive producer yeah yeah he would

124
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,400
come and give his um opinion

125
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,638
at the end of the session but not

126
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,000
necessarily

127
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,680
you know but his presence made a

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,639
difference yeah

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,040
yeah

130
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,360
and then the last album you guys made is

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
produced by damian marley that's amazing

132
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,759
can you give us a little insight as to

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,720
how all of those different personalities

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,560
produce

135
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,639
there's a similarity between bob marley

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,759
and damon marley unbeknownst to him you

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,439
know

138
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,680
because um i was in the studio at bob

139
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,759
marley back in the um

140
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,600
late 70s and

141
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
our earlier early early 80s

142
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,759
and um

143
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,279
just his attitude and his old

144
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,080
work ethic

145
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,000
there's been some similarity

146
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,680
today

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,519
amen

148
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
and leaving to him

149
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,439
and i'm just it's just quite amazing

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,360
you know saying that they have the

151
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,519
tendency to say the apple don't fall far

152
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,919
from the tree that is so true in that

153
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,478
case yeah you know so they both have

154
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,399
amazing work ethics it comes out in the

155
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,719
music too yeah

156
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,959
yeah so

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
um

158
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,959
can you tell us some of the like the

159
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,960
more memorable moments of recording your

160
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,638
last album i know you got a lot of you

161
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,120
had a lot of

162
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,960
uh guest artist on that album

163
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,360
yes the collaboration was endless you

164
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,560
know and yeah damon picked all of them

165
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,759
and thought they would be more suitable

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,759
because

167
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,600
we weren't we didn't work at producers

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,600
much shortly

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,199
but to work a day man was

170
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
exceptional you know we decided to say

171
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,520
yeah you're the younger cat

172
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,199
because um cat used to drive him to

173

i asked him it was if it was delicious

290
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,439

291
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,958
you know what do you think reggae means

292
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,000
to the world richie i know that sounds

293
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,518
like a

294
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,519
a broad question but

295
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,120
and

296
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,039
to what it means to the world i wouldn't

297
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,959
deem to answer that but you can i can

298
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,679
only tell you what how it affects the

299
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,359
world right okay

300
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,199
fair enough um

301
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,600
through the years you know when it

302
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,360
wasn't virtually unknown when i met you

303
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,440
mm-hmm you're the prep you're probably

304
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,200
one of the few white persons who knew

305
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,560
reggae yeah

306
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,759
i turned all my friends onto him

307
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:12,000
yeah and you know your first album was a

308
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,519
big hit here in the san fernando valley

309
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,799
i must say right

310
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,799
everybody i knew had it

311
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,919
agreed here we are you know and um i

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
watch it grow radio stations never used

313
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,519
to play the music

314
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,720
nobody very rarely ate the top

315
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,799
mm-hmm

316
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,839
but then you know i watched it growing

317
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,519
up and

318
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,959
i think what made the team more popular

319
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,200
is when they start to have more reggae

320
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,199
festivals yeah

321
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,120
you know yeah people just all over the

322
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,360
world carries this regular festival you

323
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,360
just have that hypnotic thing about it

324
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,039
that brings people out

325
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,120
and um during my experience with

326
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:53,679
jamaican reggae music and jamaican food

327
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,078
you know so

328
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,078
it is what it was guess what it is you

329
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,000
know so um

330
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,519
that much i can tell you well she brings

331
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
a lot of positive neutrality

332
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,480
water generation

333
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,879
yeah generation you know

334
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,440
yeah their parents learned it acquired

335
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,879
it but they are they are from in their

336
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,639
infant state

337
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:20,078
their parents are playing it

338
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,919
from they were like tiny talk

339
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,679
you know so it's a whole different look

340
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,958
for their needs yeah

341
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,559
well it's it's been a an inspiration to

342
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,199
at least me and

343
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,399
the world as far as i can say

393
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,240
few things that was like contracted some

394
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:32,000
