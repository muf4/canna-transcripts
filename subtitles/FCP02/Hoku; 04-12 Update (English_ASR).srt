[Music]

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,419
so this is greenhouse number two

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,460
running hundreds in here so little

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:09,300
smaller pots

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,820
um

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,559
I direct sewed these seeds so

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,699
kind of all over the place some of them

8
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:16,618
uh

9
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,660
didn't take and so I threw something

10
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:20,640
late

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,339
so those ones haven't been sexed yet but

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,800
uh yeah this is uh all the sweet and

13
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,800
sour series over here

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,539
so I'm working on this week

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,738
got some of the uh sprayed them

16
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,600
yesterday

17
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,699
these ones uh

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,219
didn't have any bugs on the plants but

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,379
uh got some of those light green aphids

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,640
coming in on the Clover so I chopped the

21
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,780
Clover

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,000
and composted that and then just did a

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,760
spray with some

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,280
Horticultural soap

25
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,378
thing looks happy

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,058
but yeah this is a lot of the kundo's V

27
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,298
over here

28
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:10,859
these are the uh

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,540
the sour lemon head this is a mango

30
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,579
I didn't release this one I didn't have

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,900
a lot of seeds of it but uh it's the

32
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,899
main go by sour lemon head

33
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,469
stoked for this run so I'm gonna finish

34
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,739
cloning this one this week and then

35
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,420
[Music]

36
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,420
hop over to uh

37
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,259
third greenhouse and start filling pots

38
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,779
so

39
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,239
by the end of this month I should have

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,879
all three greenhouses up and running

41
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,919
I was gonna do an outdoor plot

42
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,239
but I've got a lot of work to do out

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,099
there before I come

44
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,099
really get things going so

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:01,159
and uh yeah all this is recycled soil

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,159
chopped dress with a some of that uh

47
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,000
compost from the dairy farm

48
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,219
this little diatomaceous earth that I

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,780
sprinkled on before the nematodes to try

50
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,919
and get the fungus gnats under control

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,520
but

52
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,079
not really seeing many anymore

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,580
we need to have somewhat of an

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,580
infestation but uh

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,060
nothing too bad

56
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,759
some more sour lemon head crosses over

57
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,759
here

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,039
where is

59
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,079
yeah these are the S ones which I didn't

60
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,000
release

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,319
but uh

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,318
I don't really like it so far

63
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,500
basically got that same kind of diamond

64
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,360
diesel profile and

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,159
just uh

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,879
good structure

67
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,919
not too lanky not super branchy

68
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,518
super DP

69
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,518
so

70
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,180
yeah

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,200
and then uh yeah some more of the condos

72
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,239
V

73
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,219
but uh

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,439
there you have it Greenhouse number two

75
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,259
lights are coming on

76
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,259
and uh this will also be done sometime

77
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,878
in June so yeah a couple months behind

78
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:27,359
typically I'd have like an early spring

79
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:30,179
harvest in both houses but uh

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm just stoked to be able to uh

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,140
get everything set up in these pots and

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,280
finally not have to be resetting

83
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,279
Greenhouse every time so

84
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,439
um

85
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:45,179
I think uh in the long run I'll make up

86
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:46,679
those couple months that I was down just

87
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,700
in

88
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,700
transition time

89
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,680
yeah God ever you got the last few

90
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,000
double Enders out everything's LED and

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,879
uh

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,419
irrigation set up finally

93
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,679
been hand watering my whole life so

94
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,219
It's Gonna Save Me probably a couple

95
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,219
days a week

96
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,120
and see what else we got going

97
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:14,780
set up

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,780
months
