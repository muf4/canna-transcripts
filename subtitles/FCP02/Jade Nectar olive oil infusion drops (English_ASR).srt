1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,219
hey how's it going hope you guys are

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,259
having a good weekend

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:11,820
um I'm just hanging out here with a nice

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,380
big bag of freshly uh dried and cured

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,379
Thai

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,080
flour cannabis flour so this is our

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,880
favorite Thai strain and some other

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,459
people I have uh

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,379
uh reported they they also appreciated

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,380
the Thai strain when we use it in our

11
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,358
tincture so I've got very good news

12
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:33,859
we're just today I'm going to start

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,380
making a new batch of our high potency

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:40,019
sativa tincture and it's a thousand

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,840
milligrams of THC so

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,059
very very potent and you get a lot of

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,579
bang for your buck uh so a thousand

18
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,500
milligrams and instead of eating gummies

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,939
and all these other Edibles and such

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,039
like that

21
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,839
um we feel at least that this is a

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,120
really good value too just keeping it

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,160
really simple and in olive oil and then

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,578
with tinctures you're allowed to go up

25
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,558
to a thousand milligrams per bottle so

26
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:07,680
it really is an efficient way and an

27
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,379
incredibly healthy way to consume your

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,780
cannabis and your high potency THC but

29
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,839
don't just think this is a wellness

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:21,118
product that's not recreational this

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,659
especially this um Thai strain most

32
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:28,079
people myself included uh feel that it

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,500
is has an extremely cartoony clown-like

34
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,719
silly effect so and you actually when

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,060
you're walking you actually for some

36
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,298
reason it kind of makes you bounce so

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,519
you have to actually concentrate on not

38
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:43,618
skipping when you walk so if if that

39
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,078
sounds fun

40
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,840
get ready and look out for our new tie

41
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,658
strain so I also want to show you just

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,380
the quality of what goes into our

43
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:59,520
tinctures so right here you have it

44
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,739
and what this is this is just pure

45
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,319
trophy flowers so these could all get

46
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:07,679
trimmed up if we wanted to do trimmed

47
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,079
flour sometime but uh we actually right

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,920
now our Niche is

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,739
um is doing uh tincture the olive oil

50
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:21,000
tinctures and we feel that that's the

51
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,560
healthiest and best value way to consume

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,900
your cannabis so that's that's what

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,819
we're doing but anyway these are just

54
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,800
some of the flowers

55
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:30,958
that are going to go into this tincture

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,340
that I'm about to make actually just in

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,979
a few minutes I'm going to start making

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,920
it so here's the flowers

59
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:40,979
very killer and then

60
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,559
um this is an example this steel drum

61
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,959
this is actually empty now but this is

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,598
where our olive oil comes from so this

63
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:54,659
is comes from an artisan olive oil

64
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:57,598
manufacturer or Creator or farmer in

65
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:00,840
Paso Robles California and he actually

66
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,919
grows award-winning olive oil super high

67
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,019
vibin and then he's such an incredible

68
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,179
nerd and purist about his olive oil that

69
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,879
he actually

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,580
designed these custom stainless steel

71
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,679
drums to store the olive oil to make

72
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,260
sure it has as little oxidation as

73
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,739
possible so he does these aren't even

74
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:25,859
stored in plastic uh so it's his own

75
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,439
stainless steel drums and then he gives

76
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,120
me the polyphenol counts and everything

77
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:37,739
I mean this is top-notch high-end

78
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:40,319
Artisan olive oil so and then all we do

79
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,140
is we take

80
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,539
these flowers and we soak them in olive

81
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,839
oil not in the drum we put it in a big

82
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:52,439
Kettle type situation uh but it's all

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,039
food equipment and we just let the

84
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,199
Cannabis soak in olive oil and what

85
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,780
happens is the olive oil is the solvent

86
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,878
and it actually just naturally absorbs

87
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,620
all the cannabinoids every little bit

88
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,039
that's in the trichomes in the plant

89
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,319
matter just naturally absorbs directly

90
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,079
into the olive oil so we don't use any

91
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,419
chemicals we don't use any solvents

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,280
alcohols nothing it's just

93
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,279
olive oil

94
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,739
and pure whole flower cannabis

95
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,019
and that's it and that's all you need

96
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,460
and people have been doing that since

97
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:31,379
Biblical times and before and it works

98
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:33,739
beautifully so

99
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,719
anyway that's how Jade nectar is made

100
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,120
we'll show you more information later on

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,220
but uh just because we have this

102
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,439
beautiful bag of Thai

103
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,360
flowers right here just wanted to show

104
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,560
them to you it was a great time and also

105
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,020
let you know

106
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,740
that our tie strain is going to be

107
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:54,719
featured in our next batch of sativa and

108
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,519
then after we do the tie

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,560
we're probably going to do an African

110
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,918
selection which we've got some

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,620
mind-blowing African uh varieties uh

112
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,879
land race varieties this year too so

113
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,699
we're gonna have some really good

114
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,939
sativas as well as our indicas that are

115
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,460
going to be all Afghan and Iranian uh

116
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:17,160
indicos as well so anyway lots of good

117
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:21,180
stuff but just know

118
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:24,620
that's this is how we make uh Jade

119
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,620
nectar so uh

120
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,919
who knows maybe someday we'll do a trim

121
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:38,779
flour uh because this it's Primo anyway

122
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,779
you guys have a good one bye
