hello everybody

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,039
this is chad westport and i just wanted

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,320
to pop in here and show you a really

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,919
quick grow hack

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,759
when you don't have trellis to kind of

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,759
spread out your plant

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,359
or the branches the grow hack i'm

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,320
showing you today is

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,240
binder clips so this plant is getting

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,000
ready for flower and as you can see

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,079
i've done a pretty good job of spreading

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,759
out my main terminals to produce more

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,678
colas than if i just let this grow in

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,519
the traditional christmas tree shape

16
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,679
and kind of how i helped spread that out

17
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:37,199
is through the use of these twist ties

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:39,200
and my grow hack of binder clips

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
generally speaking after about a week or

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,040
two of being held in the new position by

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,960
the twist ties and the binder clips

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,558
the branches will take that form or keep

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,719
that shape when you remove them

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,479
so this skunk number one plant is going

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,000
to have the twist ties removed before i

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,159
put it into flour

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,679
on this temple runts plant i've already

28
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,640
removed the twist ties

29
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,479
and as you can see here and here it held

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,799
its shape from when it was bound

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,000
and tied down which allowed these to

32
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,399
grow up around it

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,118
and these to fill out in the middle so

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,880
more colas here

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,959
because of the way i used my binder

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,079
clips and spread this temple runts out

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,199
as you can see

38
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:19,920
there's now plenty of tops on the plant

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
and it's all because of this training so

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
real quick

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,960
let me recreate the binder clips on this

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,960
plant

43
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,319
whatever size of pot you're using they

44
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,798
have a binder clip for you

45
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,478
they've got large they've got medium and

46
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,040
they've got small

47
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,438
i'm using the plastic pots this also

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,759
works on fabric pots it cinches it grips

49
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:39,599
so

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,000
let me just show you real quick what i

51
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,559
did here to train this plant out

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
i just took my medium clip put it right

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,359
there on the edge of my planter

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,759
nice and sturdy grab my twist tie put it

55
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,640
in

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,759
twist it out bring it up grab my branch

57
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,599
and hold it down and if you want

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,599
you can progressively kind of tighten

59
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,039
this and bring your branch lower

60
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,798
maybe you don't want to do it all at

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,840
once you're not trying to snap the

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
branch off

63
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,439
so you can kind of slowly progressively

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,800
just keep bringing it down

65
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,239
and laying your plant out and the end

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
result of that training

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,319
is a lot more terminal shoots and i'm in

68
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,799
a tight space so the more i have the

69
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,639
better

70
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,560
and i've achieved this through my binder

71
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,719
clip grow hack so

72
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,479
