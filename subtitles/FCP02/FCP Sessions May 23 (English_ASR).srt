29
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,780
earlier that this is some of the best

30
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,359
weed we've ever had on the table and

31
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,180
I've smoked it and I'm feeling it and I

32
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,000
guess yeah so we smoked um some pie

33
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,039
scream which is some really exciting

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,800
um flour from snow till and I guess did

35
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,619
we roll up some chem yeah and you said

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,760
it was chem four chem four yeah

37
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,560
um I feel like there's a lot to even

38
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,659
talk about on with the chem 4 but I

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,819
guess yeah I mean so do you guys want to

40
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,199
just talk about what you've run recently

41
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:25,019
and what you're stoked on I think that's

42
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,939
a good place to start yeah sure

43
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,340
um I I guess I'll just talk about the

44
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,739
chem because it's it's been a go-to for

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,300
me for a really long time I've been

46
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,159
growing chem dog as long as I've been

47
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,760
growing which is most of my life at this

48
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:42,019
point uh I've lost this clone and had it

49
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,699
come back to me repeatedly that's why I

50
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:46,920
decided tangential I'm a fan of sharing

51
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,259
clones as much as possible backing them

52
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,878
up giving them to trusted people so that

53
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,939
just in case you [ __ ] something up you

54
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,799
can go get back

55
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,659
that's why this chem strand is still

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,459
available

57
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:02,400
what we're smoking on is from my indoor

58
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,459
uh all organic living soil alpaca

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,439
powered indoor my farm I make my own

60
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,400
compost and worm castings from alpaca

61
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,219
manure

62
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,480
and use it for top dressing uh and

63
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,479
reamending old soils

64
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,860
chem dog's like my favorite personally

65
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,920
because it's really uplifting it's got a

66
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,340
large amount of THC THC a consistently

67
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,500
tests over 30 percent 33 35 percent and

68
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,439
I don't actually select strains for THC

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,900
but because it's such an uplifting high

70
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,239
it's got some mysterious sativa Heritage

71
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,700
I just find it really uplifting I can

72
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,980
smoke it all day long it definitely

73
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,560
doesn't look nearly as pretty as most

74
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,598
modern stuff out there but I will always

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,840
be true to chem dog and Sour Diesel it's

76
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,119
my favorite where'd you get the genetics

77
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,479
from

78
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,239
uh I just popped uh the chemdog Special

79
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,219
Reserve that like Kevin you agree but

80
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,080
like what word you sort here so years

81
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,878
ago I went through the cat I went

82
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,340
through chem Special Reserve seeds this

83
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,979
is a clone only it's been a clone only

84
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,580
for like 20 years I've tried all

85
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:13,139
different kinds of chem seeds and

86
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,259
um there's been things that were close

87
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:18,719
but never quite the same game it was

88
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,719
just never really that that deep garlic

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,259
gas that I really love I think it

90
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,900
performs best in greenhouses for like a

91
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,460
full bodied flavor indoor

92
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,279
um it's like really really bright green

93
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:35,659
and that's really nice but it still just

94
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,719
tends to be kind of leafy and a bit Airy

95
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,280
and yeah I do a greenhouse and inside

96
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,259
it'll always be my favorite other than

97
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,739
chemdog I do a whole variety of other

98
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,240
strains I kind of change with the times

99
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,639
currently I have a bunch of weird stuff

100
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,800
growing I'm growing blue dream I got

101
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,860
Santa Cruz Blue Dream cut I think a lot

102
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,240
of people this year

103
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,919
I really like the fifth person like the

104
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,780
past two weeks I've heard today exactly

105
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,000
yeah that's crazy after I after I

106
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:05,059
secured the Clone in the winter I heard

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,019
about a bunch of other things

108
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,699
I don't know it's gonna be a flood but

109
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,918
it'll be a taste of Blue Dream out there

110
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,560

of ours that we've been growing for a

147
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,478

through Austin from Aurora genetics

153
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,740
that's why when you said that to me

154
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,360
before I was like oh yeah yeah when you

155

thought it was fruity like something I

156

understand why he would like it and I

157
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,360

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,080
yeah it grows it's actually very golf

168
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:36,418
ball you like kind of like little rocks

169
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,740
kind of like a cookies but maybe

170
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:39,359
slightly bigger

171
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,098
um but either way I grow it just because

172
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,840
of the Terps and just how coated it is

173
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:45,000
and how resinous it is and it stays

174
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,219
sticky forever like honestly like three

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,199
months down the line still great for

176
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,919
sure and Peter what uh me and Jean do

177
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,919
you have right now corners

178
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,680
[Applause]

179
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,259
[Music]

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,379
which I think the the cherry limeade and

181
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:07,160
the Cherry West related yeah yeah maybe

182
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,478
it is

183
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,939
Cherry Lyman yeah it's cherry limeade

184
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,060
for sure

185
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:14,060
it is

186
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,500
holding in my hand two opposite ends of

187
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,899
the spectrums we have cameras in and we

188
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,160
have strong and a punch rosin

189
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,538
um don't really know which one to start

190
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,800
with uh Dan which one would you

191
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,139
recommend I know you said you're a chem

192
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,840
head so cam during the day straw Nana at

193
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,399
night is is kind of my vibe uh the straw

194
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,519
down is definitely an Indica dominant

195
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,679
hybrid and and has an effect to back it

196
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,958
up I tend not to classify indica and

197
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,819
sativa but it works in this case because

198
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,819
they're older strains

199
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,740
so they're not poly hybrid yeah start

200
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,540
with the chem and then follow with the

201
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,639
straw Nana we'll do and you were telling

202
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,778
us you you wash your rosin and comes

203
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,919
from your mixed light material and just

204
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,200
want to talk about how you believe those

205
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,579
Terps and what the sun does to that oh

206
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,339
absolutely

207
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,339
um although sometimes uh the indoor

208
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,839
flower actually presents with a stronger

209
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,160
nose than my Greenhouse flower

210
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,220
the Terps that come out of the

211
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,319
greenhouse flower in a rosin wash is far

212
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,540
far superior

213
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,700
um it might not always be the brightest

214
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,219
white rosin that some people are

215
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,379
attracted to but it's a more full-bodied

216
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,300
flavor

217
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:27,899
and with the chem dog specifically it

218
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:30,539
makes super super good rosin uh chemdog

219
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,059
is a combination of terpenes and vsc's

220
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:36,059
volatile sulfur compounds is what makes

221
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:37,919
up the flavor of chem dog they've only

222
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,559
recently kind of discovered these VSC

223
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,199
things and they wash through really well

224
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,439
wow so the the the smell of the chem dog

225
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,839
rosin is more like what I remember chem

226
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,600
dog being 20 years ago

227
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,180
compared to the chem dog flower the

228
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,259
rosin is just like whoa holy cow that's

229
00:09:54,179 --> 00:10:01,259
like a lot of smell garlic nastiness

230
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:03,720
and uh so yeah it's just a concentrated

231
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,159
flavor that I love so much Ken dog the

232
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,540
tourists of the cannabinoids you're

233
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,838
looking for that remind you of the past

234
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:12,059
experience absolutely yeah

235
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,620
and do you think that and I guess this

236
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,958
is a question for both of you like do

237
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,700
you know the viral loads of the plants

238
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,679
that you have in your because you were

239
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,379
describing a terp being like it was 20

240
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,659
years ago like I know a lot of people

241
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:26,458
attribute that to hlvd do you know the

242
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:29,219
viral load do you have yourself tested

243
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:32,939
or do you just sort of grow it out as so

244
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,940
I've heard sorry

245
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,200
um I was holding that coffin for a while

246
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,580
um there are there are there are

247
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,220
differing theories

248
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,860
um behind how hlvd can affect the plant

249
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,800
but one of them is that if the plant is

250
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,259
super healthy it stays latent and even

251
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,759
in a test it might not show up similar

252
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,319
to if you have like a certain virus

253
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,120
you're only

254
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,060
um contagious while you're expressing

255
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,860
symptoms if that makes sense uh so I've

256
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,739
I have had all the stuff in my garden

257
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,259
tested and we have tested negative

258
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,820
completely to hlvd but I was actually

259
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,519
kind of shocked about that because I've

260
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,500
definitely brought clones into my garden

261
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,659
that I was immediately able to Propel

262
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,159
had hld and I would call them with like

263
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,439
within a week of them being in my garden

264
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,000
I noticed like kind of like how it would

265
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,140
grow it grows similar to a seed even

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
though it shouldn't be and then it's

267
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,360
also like branches will just like break

268
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,159
right off the stem super weak like green

269
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,480
still but like kind of lighter and if

270
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,639
you look at the leaf Sheen it's not

271
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,899
quite as like healthy as it should be so

272
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,980
I've gotten clones like that from people

273
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,078
before

274
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,940
um so I expected that it would have been

275
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,379
transferred to my garden but from the

276
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,399
last test we did we didn't we actually

277
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:43,019
tested negative completely

278
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,539
there's a thing that both of you sort of

279
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,278
share as a real one of the principles of

280
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,659
your Gardens at least and I feel like we

281
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,278
were just hoping that you both would

282
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:51,600
sort of get into conversation and that

283
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,458
you two talking to each other would be a

284
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,060
lot more interesting than any of us

285
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:58,919
chiming in but you both grow organically

286
00:11:56,059 --> 00:12:01,859
I'm totally well really that's that's

287
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,019
the parallel is so I I deal with the

288
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,600
same thing my I might be importing

289
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:09,060
viruses into my garden

290
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,399
um but we're organic and there's such

291
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,719
thing as a as an immune system in a

292
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,720
plant just as there's an immune system

293
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,120
in our body and if the plant is healthy

294
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,778
and that it's uh greatest genetic

295
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,299
potential because it's being uh it's in

296
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:27,720
symbiotic relationship with all the

297
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:30,120
microbiology in the soil it has all the

298
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,820
nutrients at its root tips thanks to

299
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,159
that biology its immune system is intact

300
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,800
and the viral load will be undetectable

301
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,559
just like he said

302
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:44,639
um so I've also imported

303
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,859
um infected plants into my garden and

304
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,500
um then tested them tested neighboring

305
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,120
plants at a later date with with

306
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,578
um with zero

307
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,120
virus detected

308
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:59,519
um it's also kind of similar uh

309
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,500
when we're talking about heavy metal

310
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,278
contamination or other soil

311
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,679
contamination if your soil is healthy

312
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,799
and organic and full of microbes

313
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,778
then your plant can't uptake as much of

314
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,519
potential heavy metals that might be

315
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:16,159
there and that's something really cool

316
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,600
that I learned through

317
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,000
through testing my products for a

318
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,920
variety of reasons is that even if

319
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,539
there's some heavy metals present and

320
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,059
some things we use like kelp or

321
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:29,219
something like that the plant doesn't

322
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,559
necessarily take it all up if the

323
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,060
microbiology is intact it's super loud

324
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,319
in this room so I'm not sure if any of

325
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,000
the people sitting next to me can

326
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,839
actually hear it yeah I'm doing my best

327
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,839
okay cool yeah

328
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,299
completely indoors so

329
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,539
um yep just very climate controlled

330
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:15,778
temperature humidity everything

331
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:19,259
um and you just do no-till same soil

332
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:19,259
everything everything

333
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,659
um well so we recently replaced like

334
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,619
almost five-year-old soil like a year

335
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,939
ago

336
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,039
um just because we wanted to start new

337
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,620
like it is kind of important to also do

338
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,719
it afresh because eventually you know as

339
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,240
we want to grow as a business we want to

340
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,278
kind of see how we can get

341
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,919
to where we want to be right off the

342
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,600
start as opposed to just relying on like

343
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,338
soil eventually balancing out which is

344
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,199
kind of what we did more when we first

345
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,160
started growing no-till so it is it is

346
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:49,078
important every once in a while and

347
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,240
we're limited on runes so we recently

348
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,939
replaced five-year-old soil

349
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,740
um but this stuff is grown in soil

350
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,959
that's three years old that was a new

351
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,339
room of ours back then

352
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,899
um and that soil is still going still

353
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,959
going strong

354
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:06,659
um that's I think it's like the 14th

355
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,799
cycle at this point very nice in that in

356
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,078
that soil

357
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,399
um but yeah and then our mother room is

358
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,179
actually our oldest soil that's almost

359
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:18,320
seven-year-old soil right now and

360
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:20,638
do cramp wise in different interactions

361
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,120
never specifically to a different

362
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,339
genetic we we do steer to some extent in

363
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,198
the sense that we try and maintain a

364
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,720
certain amount of nutrition in the

365
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:33,419
medium by whether it be a top dress or

366
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,199
mulching or whatever it might be

367
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:39,240
um but we don't we I would not say that

368
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,698
we specifically do it like I don't

369
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,860
specifically mix this ratio of these

370
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:45,240
types of amendments for that strain if

371
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,639
that makes sense

372
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,320
I kind of like give it everything it

373
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,079
might need and then like the soil will

374
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,579
figure it out I don't know yeah I mean

375
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,979
there's more to crop steering than just

376
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:58,859
the food yeah you know there's training

377
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,720
there's pruning yeah which could be more

378
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,699
important in a lot of cases exactly yeah

379
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,040
that's what I find to be more important

380
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:07,319
like you said just plot making sure

381
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,240
everything is present in the soil and

382
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,839
then just sustainable managing the

383
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,339
canopy if anything I I probably steer

384
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,560
with bulliers I don't know if you do

385
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,019
many foliars I used to do a lot of

386
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,458
foliers I used to do a lot of knf I used

387
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,159
to do a lot of compost these I used to

388
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:25,198
do a lot of ssts fpjs I one time try to

389
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:28,019
make my own fish hydrostolic I do not

390
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,939
recommend it it's not stinky yeah it was

391
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,620
it was pretty bad

392
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,880
I think I used it once even though I was

393
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,839
like I don't think I should be using

394
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,220
this

395
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,440
oh another way

396
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,879
um I've done it all as far as that was

397
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,160
concerned but I'm I'm much more

398
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,679
minimalistic now I I actually don't I

399
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:47,039
don't like the spray because

400
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:50,819
spraying was I think would brought my

401
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,559
first well I do spray oh I I do a foliar

402
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,839
spray two to three times a week during

403
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,758
veg that's just an IPM with essential

404
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,620
oils that's just to keep things at Bay

405
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,300
up until they get like about two weeks

406
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,778
into flower

407
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:07,558
um but I found that it invited some stem

408
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:09,419
rot funguses into my soil when I when I

409
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,519
would spray a lot yeah just spiking the

410
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:15,020
humidity too much yeah just a spike

411
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,019
around that area down there

412
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,479
yeah which which that stuff is darling

413
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,400
because that that will kill a plant in

414
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,318
like 24 hours would you call your soil

415
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,298
heavy

416
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,519
well heavy as in like does it weigh a

417
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:29,700
lot or heavy relative to

418
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:32,039
potting soil extremely heavy because I

419
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,960
so it's kind of a mistake I made and I

420
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,659
learned that recently but I've been

421
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,160
using uh lava rock very religiously

422
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,798
thinking that I don't want to cut my

423
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,779
worms up or my soil biology and not use

424
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,940
perlite because there there was people

425
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:48,000
who claimed for a while that perlite

426
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,798
remember that yeah so so then then I

427
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,179
discovered that this whole this whole

428
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,819
time I discovered that perlite's just

429
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,340
puffed up Lava Rock anyways and it's

430
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:59,700
yeah so then and then I'm like oh oh

431
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:01,139
that's kind of a mistake so now I'm

432
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,519
gonna be working with perlite but I

433
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,900
already made these beds back when I

434
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,558
still thought that I had to do lavrock

435
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:11,038
so yeah my soil is insanely heavy Yeah

436
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:13,918
well yeah so pumice is is really heavy

437
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:16,500
um I use both limitedly

438
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,419
I find pumice it because it's heavy it

439
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,000
doesn't rise to the top but that's what

440
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,320
I like about it it's pretty nice yeah

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,720
um I was just talking with someone about

442
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:28,379
that prayer light is really helpful it's

443
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,319
I think that rumor that myth of worms

444
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,320
disliking perlite came from people with

445
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,819
like really dead potting soil with [ __ ]

446
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,558
tons of perlite

447
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:39,599
and like they put worms in it and the

448
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,178
worms would leave immediately and so

449
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,639
people told each other that myth when in

450
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,660
reality if you have a healthy composty

451
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,340
soil

452
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,960
you know if your soil is not just like a

453
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:53,159
bagpipe so if you've got lots of good

454
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,160
healthy organic matter like over 10 15

455
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,058
20 organic matter then the worms are

456
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,759
going to want to stay there because

457
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:02,279
there's stuff for them to eat

458
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:04,879
most bag soils it's just like cocoa pea

459
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,879
and like a little bit of compost

460
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,160
I've I grow a lot of worms on my farm

461
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,140
being outside provides the benefit of

462
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,400
being able to compost and worm farm

463
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:19,980
pretty easily and I've shared Millions

464
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,019
hundreds of thousands of worms with my

465
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,640
fellow Farmers up there and a lot of

466
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,599
them have told me oh well they just ran

467
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,660
away

468
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,480
oh I'm near Grass Valley uh it's called

469
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,360
Nevada County California so are you

470

00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:37,440
um but you mentioned you grow your own

497
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,298
worms and you know the alpacas are in

498
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,919
your packaging as well but could you

499
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,779
mention how you got to that point and

500
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,600
what kind of drove you towards that

501
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:49,079
specific route sure okay so my journey

502
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:51,418
with worms goes back to Childhood where

503
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,879
I live near a swamp and I was obsessed

504
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,160
with bugs and I was always collecting

505
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,960
bugs and chasing snakes and animals of

506
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,640
all kinds where the story usually starts

507
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,319
yeah like when I was a kid I was really

508
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:07,220
into bugs and like a really nerdy kind

509
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:07,220
of way and then skip 20 years

510
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:14,160
Peter likes the Slugs right now Peter's

511
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:16,019
Pro your pro slug banana slug or I've

512
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,740
been doing that I'm literally up at

513
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:22,319
night battling slugs

514
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,980
yeah no I do that okay

515
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,678
um

516
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,380
but I have a little one gallon of pots

517
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,380
that I bring inside

518
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:33,120
because they were I chopped the tops off

519
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,520
plants that were outside but they were

520
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,979
just one gallon and then I planted the

521
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,960
new seeds in those but brought them

522
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,798
inside but all the bugs that were in it

523
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:47,538
came in so at night like slugs come up

524
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:49,740
inside from the bottom of the pond like

525
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:51,179
diatomaceous earth

526
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,859

00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:02,459
the bug talk oh come on bugs are cool

531
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,679
okay so you asked me what my favorite

532
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,900
bug is I don't know probably worms

533
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,240
because they're super [ __ ] cool and

534
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,159
they're pretty easy pets black soldier

535
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,500
flies are fun too but I have chickens

536
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,100
and so flies are just like the band of

537
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,099
my existence

538
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,559
I know I just have enough flies at my

539
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:24,719
property I've actually started doing the

540
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,918
the fly traps and then feeding them to

541
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,319
the chickens

542
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,100
and so it's like I'm catching like horse

543
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,359
flies oh boy Whoa

544

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,380
time

589
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,940

602
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,399

603
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,220
really is absolutely product of the

604
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,400
plant and in my mind you are

605
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,839

657
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,140
flower actually feels like you're

658
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,759
smoking rosin because it is so fully

659
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,740
expressed

660
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,940
um which is why it's stuff that I love

661
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,099
to smoke

662
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,159
um I guess are there any you know you

663
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,000
seem to run new stuff every year which I

664
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,820
adore

665
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,220
and you have a really refined stable

666
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,678
which I also adore and I feel like I

667
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,419
don't know that is was an interesting

668
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,860
thing to me

669
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,778
um so I was actually gonna say there are

670
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,178
a couple of trains that are new that

671
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:39,839
were that we are starting to grow

672
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,240
um

673
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,558
the one that I'm most excited about well

674
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,620
one of them that we started with

675
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:48,058
recently but I don't have it here and I

676
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:50,038
feel like an idiot for not bringing it

677
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:51,778
but I'll get I'll make sure that you get

678
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,700
some to try because I'd love to hear

679
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:56,220
your feedback on it would be the J1

680
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,400
obviously oh and Shout Out Max because

681
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,298
I've tried it and it is great yeah it is

682
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,940
great

683
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:04,740
um and so the Jaguar is I would say

684
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,778
we've even refined it more than probably

685
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,759
since the batch because I think that was

686
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:11,038
I'm pretty sure Max tried it from our

687
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,619
first batch we're already we're already

688
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,960
like four batches past that so it's been

689
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:18,058
it's been refined quite a lot and so I

690
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,440
guess what are the adjustments seem

691
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:22,319
batch

692
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,519
if the flower I mean if the soil is

693
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,918
staying the same I mean is it

694
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,298
environmental controls is it generally

695
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,700
going to be environmental controls on

696
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:31,200
how much the plant gets watered and how

697
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,058
the plant gets trained that's going to

698
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,558
be the two biggest factors certain

699
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:36,359
plants like a lot more water certain

700
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,259
plants like a lot less

701
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:42,298
um J1 loves a lot of water because it is

702
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:43,558
a beast of a plant Mountain Organics

703
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:47,400
gave that Ian gave it to me and he's

704
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:51,480
like listen she's gonna go wild and he

705
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,580
he was not getting just colas like I had

706
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,000
never heard of J1 before meeting him

707
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:58,678
like eight or nine months ago Dan sits

708
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,839
there in horror but it's Jack adjacent

709
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:04,159
right for everyone who doesn't know do

710
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,158
you know exactly what it is

711
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:18,839
so it's basically a Jack just with like

712
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
a little bit of a funk it's like like 95

713
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,480
Jack five percent like weight something

714
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,480
funky

715
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:27,619
and then I'm growing the one

716
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,820
yeah and that is

717
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,819
um

718
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:39,320
damn I might have to look it up like so

719
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,558
I'm like Kandahar Afghani cross with

720
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:46,319
something else and it's like apparently

721
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:48,720
like one of the oldest classic Berry I

722
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,220
don't know like floral intensity oh so

723
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,079
this isn't something he read this is

724
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,720
just something he holds this is

725
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,339
something you tell that's this is like

726
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,960
decades old this cup that's awesome so

727
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:59,759
so this is like

728
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,679
I've been trying to find I've been

729
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,419
trying to find those extra special cuts

730
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,100
from way back when because something I

731
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:07,799
hear a lot of people try and say and

732
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:10,519
tell me if you agree with me on this

733
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,898
um a lot of people like to [ __ ] on

734
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:15,778
basically basically people like to talk

735
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:18,058
back that back in the day there wasn't

736
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:20,038
great weed and only now we know what

737
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:23,240
good weed even is right

738
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:26,220
no I've heard people I've heard

739
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,298
he's heard this argument too yeah but

740
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,278
it's total [ __ ] because back before

741
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:34,440
Hydroponics came out

742
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,359
people were probably growing out in soil

743
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,798
and part of me bringing back some of

744
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:39,599
these old 30 year old strains and then

745
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:41,038
growing in indoor and soil is to kind of

746
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,439
prove a point that some of these

747
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,819
genetics are actually amazing and back

748
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,120
then they probably did actually know

749
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:50,038
what good weed was and that also gets us

750
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,658
back to the plant Health thing and that

751
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:53,759
the soil you know if the plant is

752
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:57,360
healthy ultimately the viral load May

753
00:30:53,759 --> 00:31:00,359
Express in an undetectable type way and

754
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,519
you're then getting how it smoked back

755
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:05,459
then and if it's grown you know under

756
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,379
the conditions then yeah I don't you

757
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,240
know I think it's a complicated and then

758
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,620
so the old Cuts don't appear as good as

759
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,960
the new Cuts because the new cuts are

760
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:15,479
dialed for new type rooms you know and

761
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,340
so run side by side the two things yeah

762
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,038
I guess the new thing is better

763
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:21,480
but that's not necessarily I mean this

764
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:23,398
is a complicated thought that I'm

765
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,519
struggling I think also I mean there's a

766
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:25,519
lot of

767
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:29,339
a lot of

768
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,799
um a larger percentage of people growing

769
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:34,379
plants at this point are actually

770
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:37,798
their skills are Beyond even a skilled

771
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,539
grower of the early 80s late 80s let's

772
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:44,058
say yeah it's like the information

773
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:47,058
that's available to the average Growers

774
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:49,319
even like the worst Growers

775
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:50,220
you didn't have to hatch the white label

776
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,099
warning without because that actually

777
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,500
smoked one life for us

778
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:58,259
oh yeah James does burn does do wider

779
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,640
but yeah whatever it's uh I just like

780
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:02,099
Warren in general because I'm like

781
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,179
people get triggered about that and so

782
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:05,639
you know we were talking about the old

783
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:08,580
schools transaction but we had smoked um

784
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,500
the snow till pie scream earlier and to

785
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:13,139
your credit you had talked about that

786
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,579
was your version of a candy and you know

787
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,200
in your genetic stable you you don't

788
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:17,699
really have much that qualifies it so

789
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,840
people don't really think of you they

790
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,580
aren't inclined to think of as such and

791
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:21,839
you just want to talk about you know

792
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:23,699
what sort of Direction you want to go

793
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,558
with that or what you envisioned for

794
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,038
candy when when you grow something and

795
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:28,038
call it candy

796
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,769
[Music]

797
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,220
you of all people

798
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:50,099
what I'm talking about ice cream cake

799
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,620
well I don't grow it anymore do you not

800
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:55,259
I think I I only I only grew for like

801
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:58,139
six months I just I just like

802
00:32:55,259 --> 00:33:00,480
I grew it after everyone stopped growing

803
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,278
it I was like oh wow this is awesome

804
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,778
what I've been missing out the whole

805
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:05,220
time and then and then I tell people I'm

806
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:06,778
like I have the nicest weed you've ever

807
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,798
seen and then be like what's your like

808
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,419
ice cream cake they'd be like we don't

809
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,579
even want to see it they're like no and

810
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,600
I leave it at home I'm like please just

811
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:14,158
look at it

812
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,359
and I was saying that in a positive play

813
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,799
because you're one of the few people

814
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,839
that know

815
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,639
you know everybody just said that it's

816
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,798
good

817
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,360
I'll actually totally agree with you uh

818
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,220
ice cream cake the right cut in the

819
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,278
right hands is phenomenal it's really

820
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,200
good weed and it passes many people's

821
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,298
tests under 100 different names and they

822
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,399
don't know it it's probably the number

823
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:37,398
one renamed strain in the universe

824
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,798
so yeah I mean I think ice cream cake as

825
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,298
well but you were saying that you want a

826
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:43,859
candy sweetness that's different than

827
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:46,379
the sort of like [ __ ] Know You're Gonna

828
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:47,939
Roll and then just smoosh it guys get

829
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,299
into that let them really get in those

830
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,298
chirps

831
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:58,079
what are we rolling up James OG so fire

832
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,120
and the James OG is a cut I mean would

833
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,740
you tell the story

834
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:04,379
um are you you know part of the story

835
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,880
whatever it's oh yeah no it's a very

836
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,720
short story I mean there's a guy named

837
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,539
James

838
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,858
he was a friend of ours like we didn't

839
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:13,259
really know him that well but he had to

840
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:14,579
grow in Oakland and uh he had a legal

841
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,580
grow in Oakland and he let us come over

842
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:19,500
there and he let us pick up his genetics

843
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:21,898
sometimes and then

844
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,878
he gave us his James OG in about two to

845
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:25,618
three months later just like moved up to

846
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:29,039
Humboldt and his phone's been off ever

847
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:30,539
since and that person's name James yeah

848
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,418
it's just an OG from a guy named James

849
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:34,739
James claimed it was a 20 years old so I

850
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:36,598
have a suspicion about it you notice how

851
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,219
it has almost like a skiddly kind of

852
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,599
vibe going on like something sweet about

853
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,819
it you can squish it we're gonna roll

854
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,159
that out and the

855
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,659
yeah yeah like if you like squish it a

856
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,639
little bit you should smell too within

857
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,619
the gas there's almost like that same

858
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,460
Skittle but it's but there's also a

859
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:54,838
really nice lemon limey really bomb but

860
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,460
we actually have someone here who's

861
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,619
incredibly well equipped to talk about

862
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,659
this that Otis I mean Peter wanted to

863
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,480
join us earlier so I'm gonna go grab

864
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:06,299
yeah yeah it's like somewhere between

865
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,880
Skywalker and sfv but not quite either

866
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,740
one I have no so so I was like I'll tell

867
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,119
you my theory behind it it's got

868
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:14,118
something else in there for sure

869
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,320
out there

870
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:24,119
all right here we go let's roll this

871
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,140
[ __ ] up time to roll it up let's roll it

872
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,720
up

873
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:29,338
um yeah so my theory behind the James OG

874
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:30,419
is that it was

875
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:32,940
um

876
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,740
this guy this guy had an OG probably an

877
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,760
sfv or something similar something

878
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:37,500
classic

879
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,240
and I would guess he crossed it with

880
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,480
something he used to call his he called

881
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:44,819
it Stone and that was a sunset Sherbert

882
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,460
grown up I think honestly in Nevada

883
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,320
Grass Valley uh area

884
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,420
um he claimed he had this famous Sunset

885
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,160
Sherbert that people called it Stone and

886
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,619
he crossed it with everything

887
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,719
and almost all his genetics

888
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,300
that he gave us was crossed with that

889
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:03,239
and I would guess that this OG of his is

890
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,880
actually Sunset Sherbert crossed with

891
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:10,019
some kind of OG which is why it is both

892
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,240
gassy but has some kind of like

893
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:13,500
sweet it has a sweetness and then it

894
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,358
becomes very complex like you know

895
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,338
sometimes chirps cancel themselves out

896
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,719
but almost almost in like a way that

897
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:20,940
it's like well wait there's actually

898
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,618
more now yeah

899
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,019
yeah

900
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:27,599
yeah we're like evolving there were the

901
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:29,519
course of the tasting experience so it

902
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,240
is a round flavor

903
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,239
love it

904
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,599
here's the more camera be like and I

905
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:39,619
love this Camp dude I was I was just

906
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,619
sitting on that joint for a while

907
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:44,879
delish

908
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,619
I just hogged something for a long time

909
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,838
it was bomb it might need a little relay

910
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:50,099
was that is that that's the pen this is

911
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:52,320
the greenhouse cabinet yeah the

912
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,880
greenhouse cam is smoking for sure the

913
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,019
between the greenhouse chem and the pie

914
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,539
scream

915
00:36:55,019 --> 00:37:00,440
some of the most delicious smoke

916
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:00,440
in a while

917
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:07,680
here I'm gonna send this one out

918
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,260
hey Peter send this one out

919
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,000
Greenhouse cabin the first one was the

920
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,260
indoor cab

921
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,519
yeah

922
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,880
most people can't tell the difference

923
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:22,079
unless they look at it actually

924
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,539
and so yeah I guess do you

925
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,400
like what is your indoor what are your

926
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:29,099
indoor practices do you do beds do you

927
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,079
do small containers I never so I'm

928
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,700
actually not even running in indoor

929
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,079
right now I shut it down just a few

930
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:37,019
months ago I'm actually pretty happy

931
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:41,060
about it just to have a break

932
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:46,320
um I was doing seven gallon fabric pots

933
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:49,139
they were on I don't know less than 10

934
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,760
rounds on them

935
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:54,059
um and they were just being amended with

936
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,740
my worm castings in alpaca and a little

937
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:58,099
bit of vital stuff but my indoor

938
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:01,799
regiment was pretty simple

939
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:03,119
I can't do it at home and so

940
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,460
um yeah I don't know at some point I'll

941
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,460
revisit doing indoor uh

942
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,179
type situation as well you

943
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,280
know I didn't and empty the containers

944
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:16,739
yeah they were just small containers

945
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,420
relative to most people it's about as

946
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:20,459
small as I would ever recommend an

947
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,700
organic pot inside like I said seven

948
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,838
gallon fabric pots we ran yeah I

949
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:27,118
wouldn't recommend somebody doing

950
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:30,119
organic in anything smaller than that

951
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,039
really it should be like 30 or more but

952
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,780
you know the the square beds and

953
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:35,338
everything takes time to get there and

954
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,839
we don't all start with all the

955
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:39,599
equipment and all the cool stuff that we

956
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,519
want to have eventually I've had that

957
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,200
stuff and gotten rid of it and gotten it

958
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,880
again

959
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,539
um I know a lot of people think that

960
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,059
they can't attempt no-till

961
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:53,159
um until they have you know a lot of

962
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:55,078
things to do so and that's that's not

963
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,618
true you can't actually recycle your

964
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,599
soil in a container effectively just do

965
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:02,579
it natural way and don't push it too

966
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,500
hard don't try to over fertilize it when

967
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:06,300
you're flowering and then your soil will

968
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,039
be great next time you you want to plant

969
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,019
in it so

970
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:11,279
yeah I just see that as a barrier to a

971
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:13,259
lot of people growing organically

972
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,640
indoors a lot of people turn to salts

973
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,400
because it's like cleaner cleaner and

974
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,679
easier inside just home growth scale I

975
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,039
mean and you know to see people learning

976
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,719
how to reuse their 10 gallon pots 15

977
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,460
gallon pots it's going to be awesome

978
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,939
it's gonna It's Gonna Save the Planet

979
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,858
this much and I'm cool with that so yeah

980
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,000
that's awesome

981
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:36,119
oh yeah

982
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,820
yeah and I I would love to do to to

983
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,740
start up an indoor again but uh like I

984
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,539
said I have a day job now yeah yeah and

985
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:44,459
I'm actually enjoying the diversity in

986
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:47,579
my life awesome instead of just like

987
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,559
plants 12 hours a day yeah it's like

988
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:53,579

representing

1090
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,358
from what sort of I Now understand kind

1091
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:50,338
of like a much more focused and then

1092
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:52,318
also a much more broad gas where like

1093
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:54,719

1094
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,000
Nuance what did you call the James ogb4

1100
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Hemi gas it isn't the fuel yeah face

1101

1103
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,838
guess you do you run any of the other

1104
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:17,519
chems because you were talking about

1105
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,159

1108
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:28,800

1111
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,060
right now I was gonna say about the

1112
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:39,679
James OG it really just it really

1113
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:39,679
reminds me of I don't know

1114
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,740
that was a game

1115
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,059
oh okay that's awesome

1116
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,059
so you were saying about what I'm about

1117
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:58,560
to hit yeah I mean from the from the

1118
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:59,880
smell I haven't smoked it yet but it

1119
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,358
really just reminds me of some of the

1120
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,880
great great OG cuts of years past that

1121
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,880
had those Piney and Lemony flavors he

1122
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,818
said it's a 20 year old very newest oh

1123
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,619
geez like this this might not be an

1124
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:16,380
adulterated OG it might actually just be

1125
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:18,358
an old OG cut that was kept really well

1126
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,220
and I that's kind of what I get from it

1127
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,259
because there's there's one that went

1128
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:24,539
around another just OG went around for

1129
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,099
years as lemon Larry yeah I was it's

1130
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:28,079
funny because other people have told me

1131
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,640
that they think this ladder that they

1132
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,920
thought this might be similar to Larry

1133
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:33,659
OG it kind of is but then at the same

1134
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,940
time someone else told me recently like

1135
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:37,078
because the lemon Larry that I saw but

1136
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,179
not lemon layer I've heard of straight

1137
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:42,660
up Larry but are they the same like

1138
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:45,118
lemon they probably are right yeah but

1139
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:48,239
the Larry OG that I saw many years ago

1140
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,119
for many for many years wasn't lemony at

1141
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,159
all gotcha yeah yeah and so so don't let

1142
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,200
them because the name has nothing to do

1143
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:58,858
with flavor apparently they're the guy

1144
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:00,419
Larry his nickname was lemon Larry so I

1145
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:02,279
just learned because he put lemon peels

1146
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,920
and all no I'm just kidding in all the

1147
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,960
bags you ever heard about that back in

1148
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,740
the day

1149
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,079
I think this is just a good old OG cop

1150
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:14,639
that's my opinion of it because they

1151
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,260
used to have all kinds of nuances to

1152
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:19,078
them and there's like the two sides of

1153
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,859
gas there's like chem sour which is you

1154
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,859
know you know

1155
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,000
and then there's the ogs which were much

1156
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,900
more nuanced and back in the day there

1157
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,280
was

1158
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,280
probably

1159
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,940
50 different OG names that were all the

1160
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,800
same cut well and I've heard that X is

1161
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,300
actually why you know what I mean like I

1162
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,619
would not want to get into it but it

1163
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,720
does seem like you know the lore around

1164
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:44,579
OG is is not so if you had a chance to

1165
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,838
smell the motor breath well motor breath

1166
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:47,839
is a newer cross absolutely

1167
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:52,940
right I mean it's sort of 91-ish

1168
00:47:55,318 --> 00:48:00,239
yeah it's got more of that like Funk

1169
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:02,219
garlic kind of smell and so the 91 you

1170
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,858
mentioned the four and the five but what

1171
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:08,759
so not the 91 not the D not the sixth

1172
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:10,858
m91 is also known as as chem 91 triple

1173
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,780
back cross it's been DNA genetics

1174
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:16,139
re-bred the seeds a bunch of years ago

1175
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:19,440
if you know hunted thousands of them and

1176
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:20,879
then uh selected and so they kept one

1177
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,639
specific

1178
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,740
clone from a seed run that they did but

1179
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:30,000
this was

1180
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:31,318
10 15 plus years after the chem 4 was

1181
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,818
discovered

1182
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:41,358
Kim Flores had gone away already

1183
00:48:34,818 --> 00:48:44,480
chem 91 is a back Cross of chem seeds

1184
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:47,460
made there was never a precurs sorry

1185
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,338
thing that they were okay yeah and then

1186
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:53,818
the chem four yeah is in theory clone

1187
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:55,858
only since 91.

1188
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:58,199
or earlier

1189
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:01,078
so then what is the where does the D fit

1190
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:03,179
into any of those chem dog yeah is chem

1191
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:06,500
dog the guy the guy's nickname is was

1192
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:09,239
chemdog and then where does the CIS

1193
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:12,059
Kim's sister I don't know Kim's sister I

1194
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,779
don't I don't remember the story on that

1195
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:15,539
one

1196
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,339
I think it's adjacent but I don't

1197
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:18,779
actually know the story we're and I

1198
00:49:17,338 --> 00:49:21,000
think you know there's there's other

1199
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,980
versions of the story but I also am

1200
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,239
inclined to believe you

1201
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,119
I'm

1202
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,799
I just listened to like what older

1203
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,240
people have told me about it over the

1204
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,519
years

1205
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,500
um I'm from New York originally so

1206
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:37,019
there's lots of Sour Diesel lore in New

1207
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,480
York because that's where it's from

1208
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:42,539
um you know it's Massachusetts super

1209
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,880
skunk and chem dog the chemdog seeds

1210
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:46,920
came from dead A Grateful Dead show on

1211
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,440
the west coast back to the east coast

1212
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:52,800
they came in a bag of weed and there was

1213
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:57,358
many seeds chem 4 was one two three

1214
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,980
fourth seed chem five is fifth seed

1215
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,380
um

1216
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,619
well the people are still around to like

1217
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,000
tell the story so I hope I hope I'm not

1218
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:09,000
[ __ ] it up

1219
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,400
no that's super that's super cool

1220
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,818
um and it's you know I feel inclined to

1221
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,818
believe you

1222
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,780
is this the James

1223
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,639
James

1224
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:25,879
this is candy

1225
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:25,879
what's this

1226
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:32,780
oh bomb wow

1227
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:43,559
is it good it tastes like Skittles it's

1228
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,619
good might not be as candy as indoor

1229
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:48,659
version but it's really good

1230
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:50,220
I love Skittles I'm excited for the

1231
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:52,219
Hindi Skittles

1232
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:52,219
s

1233
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:59,960
Turf Hogs skittless

1234
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:04,980
no but so wait um we were just talking

1235
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:08,039
about Skittles over here what were you

1236
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:10,980
guys talking about oh my God any more

1237
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:11,639
mics for me it's two microphones

1238
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,559
um

1239
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:15,358
we were talking about a multitude of

1240
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,680
things uh I was pretty stoned talking

1241
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,480
off Joe's here but I appreciate him

1242
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:19,739
we're talking about studies yeah studies

1243
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,900
and Joe was mentioning his favorite

1244
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:23,399
method of consumption is Edibles and my

1245
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,660
next question was do you make your own

1246
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,920
Edibles

1247
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:28,679
um yes

1248
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,480
but my favorite edible

1249
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:32,578
okay some problems when I make my own

1250
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,400
Edibles I end up with a little bit of an

1251
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:37,318
edible problem and then and then every

1252
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,180
then everything stops getting the

1253
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:40,800
cookies

1254
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:42,239
then I can't smoke anymore then I can't

1255
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,700
smoke anymore because like I don't feel

1256
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,558
it like I'm just like okay like I'm like

1257
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:48,779
let's really get high who's who's got a

1258
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,519
200 milligram cookie and it goes all day

1259
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:53,040
people just look at you like what the

1260
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:55,318
[ __ ] is wrong with this guy

1261
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,358
yeah dude I was doing this thing where I

1262
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:59,219
was Sous videing the weed and then using

1263
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:00,960
it I was like sous-ving the weed and

1264
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:02,519
then infusing it to in theory trap

1265
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,619
things that would be volatilized when

1266
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:06,719
you do it in an open oven and that [ __ ]

1267
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:09,240
like put me in like a like gray out for

1268
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,098
like five days six days once I was like

1269
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:13,019
doing all my due diligences and duties

1270
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:14,338
but like I did not remember you know

1271
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:15,659
what was happening

1272
00:52:14,338 --> 00:52:18,420
you know you could really get into an

1273
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:21,058
edible like uh hole for sure that's

1274
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:23,940
crazy so so I've I've done that in the

1275
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:25,319
past so I prefer to try for my own sake

1276
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,720
and for the sake of me being able to

1277
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,279
actually smoke and enjoy it

1278
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:31,739
um I like to keep my tolerance down to

1279
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,140
like about 40 milligrams and then I'm

1280
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:36,719
pretty [ __ ] high from that so I do

1281
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:39,239
like to get like dosed Edibles and I'm

1282
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:40,919
just gonna shout out like their wreck

1283
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,439
brand but I think she does an amazing

1284
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,300
job Wendy from Space Jam Space Jams I've

1285
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,760
been I've been like it's amazing I've

1286
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,079
been buying space I've I bought like ten

1287
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,640
thousand dollars worth of space jams in

1288
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:52,680
the past like yeah I got something in my

1289
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,539
bags like three years alone like every

1290
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:55,919
every week I come dispensary and they

1291
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,179
see me with my dog and they give my dog

1292
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,099
a treat and they know I'm coming for my

1293
00:52:57,179 --> 00:53:01,259
two packs of space jams and I just see

1294
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:02,579
like 40 milligrams a night I don't know

1295
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,859
if that math made exact sense maybe

1296
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:07,700
three I got a week but yeah I really

1297
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:11,159
love space jams

1298
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:14,219
so knockout

1299
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:16,618
but but I might start buying some Zaza

1300
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:18,659
cookies you know by the way humble and

1301
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:21,720
from Wendy I believe is her name

1302
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:24,058
um right but I think I think the cash

1303
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:26,759
that goes into the edible oh yes it's

1304
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:27,900
from Talking trees

1305
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,359
yeah I think that's right yeah and I

1306
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,300
like it's all bubble hash it's not I

1307
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:35,159
mean rosin Edibles are awesome but like

1308
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,440
so it makes hers different and they

1309
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:39,480
smack they're like yeah it's just ice

1310
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,700
water hash it's not the rosin yeah yeah

1311
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,818
no they do they smack that it's like you

1312
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:43,818
have

1313
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:50,220
um I I don't know but you know I'm sure

1314
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:52,079
they figured it out I would I would well

1315
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:53,399
if it's ice water hash hash is

1316
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,200
technically already decarb that's why

1317
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,240
people love making Edibles with hashback

1318
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,279
in the day that's why when you had that

1319
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:01,558
hash brownie that tasted real hashy you

1320
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,839
knew you were it wasn't gonna end it

1321
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:05,280
wasn't gonna end well and your heart

1322
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,259
would start racing and you'd be like

1323
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,940
[ __ ]

1324
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,520
brings back good memories and bad

1325
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,599
memories yeah exactly

1326
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:17,059
yeah

1327
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:17,059
I wish I could get that high anymore but

1328
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:20,358
yeah yeah

1329
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:43,099
I have a strawberry banana I grow but

1330
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:43,098
very rarely like

1331
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,980
my straw Nana I'll I yeah that one would

1332
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:51,838
be a cool one to see I don't grow a lot

1333
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,940
of it because it's a terribly slow

1334
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:56,039
vegging plant and it does not yield very

1335
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,358
well but it's delicious but notice we

1336
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:00,259
were talking on the phone with a couple

1337
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:03,539
breeder homies right recently yeah

1338
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:06,180
you know finicky time for finicky but

1339
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:08,338
Timeless yeah oh

1340
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:12,419
oh of course it's it is super Timeless

1341
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:14,039
like it is it it is insanely strawberry

1342
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,420
banana like it's like every time you

1343
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:18,300
smell it you're like

1344
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,400
it's that have you ventured to grow

1345
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,460
strong down indoors or was it always a

1346
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,440
greenhouse for you uh no I've never

1347
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:28,500
grown it indoors

1348
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,338
um I would have I would have maybe tried

1349
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,099
um

1350
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:33,900
I kept running different things indoors

1351
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:37,318
I didn't settle on one thing other than

1352
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,940
the cab I for a period of time was

1353
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:40,858
chasing look because that's what people

1354
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,539
were after and I got really bored with

1355
00:55:40,858 --> 00:55:45,058
that

1356
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:48,239
um most of what I've grown indoors over

1357
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:50,819
my lifetime is Kevin sour sour d that

1358
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,439
was it's um I don't know maybe it's

1359
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:54,659
because I'm from New York but always and

1360
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,260
forever probably hold Sour Diesel

1361
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:59,818
well-grown organically inside over all

1362
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,040
other flowers and I think we don't have

1363
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:05,159
it tonight

1364
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:07,199
I don't that one I lost it it's hard

1365
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:09,179
yeah it's hard to say it's something

1366
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:11,838
something candy Joe grows one of the

1367
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:14,279
best is sour

1368
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:17,420
headband right or am I totally yeah yeah

1369
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,420
Sour Diesel exception

1370
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,200
and so that's I feel like it's a very

1371
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,180
cool tarp and I agree with you that it's

1372
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:26,460
you know that's another strong Timeless

1373
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:28,139
one and that's a newer addition to your

1374
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:30,300
so what are the other newer ones that

1375
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:32,539
you're looking at oh so it was just the

1376
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,539
one

1377
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,579
um have you tried my Mirage ever no

1378
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:40,079
so my Mirage is like okay this is a

1379
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:41,460
crazy strain I took it out of production

1380
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,220
because

1381
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:46,260
it was back when Tangy orange chirps

1382
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:47,879
just worn like people weren't vibing

1383
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,440
with that at all but I'm bringing it

1384
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,880
back now because it's more orange than

1385
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,500
anything not even Tangy it's like

1386
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,980
straight up orange turps which I miss

1387
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:58,679
massive growing plant and um

1388
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:00,960
hasn't test insanely high for Terps like

1389
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:02,399
it tested at like five plus percent and

1390
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,639
I don't have money to pay the labs off

1391
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,639
guys

1392
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:11,039
no fake tests

1393
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:14,179
yeah for sure you guys can have

1394
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,179
whichever mic you want

1395
00:57:17,338 --> 00:57:20,699
I probably in the meantime feel free to

1396
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:22,618
keep using that one it looks like it's

1397
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:24,118
off oh you know what there might be a

1398
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:25,500
little battery that popped outside oh

1399
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:26,940
that's what it is there's a battery that

1400
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,159
popped out

1401
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:32,760
I just unplugged might just be on the

1402
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:35,358
couch we got a battery somewhere nice

1403
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,359
good fine

1404
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:39,358
right

1405
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,179
we do get enough orange chirps I mean we

1406
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:47,480
have a you know a friend

1407
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:50,159
um who did this thing called Omakase

1408
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,900
that you know was this orange orange

1409
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:54,719
Skittles this like Drop cookie orange

1410
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:56,760
Skittles and I it had such an amazing

1411
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,379
reception out here that's awesome um I

1412
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,240
think that people kind of actually want

1413
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,800
that flavor yeah they're like craving

1414
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,179
you know it goes through a cycle so

1415
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,920
people haven't seen that in a very long

1416
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,838
time so now all of a sudden like our

1417
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,680
that's why I'm doing the J1 although not

1418
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:12,299
Orange it's still got that

1419
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:14,219
terpinoline Rich yeah you can call it

1420
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,980
yeah honestly yeah it's it's that super

1421
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:18,719
terpinel and Rich like just makes your

1422
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,280
nose Wrinkle in the best way possible

1423
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:22,439
like everyone remembers their first time

1424
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,359
smelling Jack they're like oh my God

1425
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,519
what is that I didn't know we could

1426
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:27,838
smell that sweet yeah and then it

1427
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:30,179
definitely makes your nose wrinkles

1428
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,980
popping out of my chest and I don't know

1429
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:34,019
if it's just like the time that I

1430
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,240
started smoking but I just received that

1431
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:38,338
dirt most with like a train wrecky thing

1432
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,318
yeah but it's obviously in all of it you

1433
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:42,480
ever tried time wreck what's time wreck

1434
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:46,980
yeah no it was train wreck times maybe

1435
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,719
XJ 13. I used to smoke a lot of xj13 or

1436
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:51,179
maybe or maybe it was something or maybe

1437
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:54,118
time train right across the space maybe

1438
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:55,679
I'm all right never mind I could be

1439
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:57,720
making all this up don't don't take my

1440
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,838
word on it probably bomb let me look it

1441
00:58:57,719 --> 00:58:59,838
up

1442
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,110
[Music]

1443
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:13,379
straw Nano on straw Nana

1444
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:16,759
both full term flour and rosin all from

1445
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,760
full term yeah

1446
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:22,019
yeah people probably don't see a whole

1447
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,400
lot of like really good representations

1448
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:25,400
of full-time flowers

1449
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:30,358
and Trinity is another one that I feel

1450
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:32,579
like that's a Time wreck like I would

1451
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:34,558
love a classic TJ that was wait

1452
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:36,839
something the Trinity is what I was like

1453
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,160
my melting weed for me back in the day

1454
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:40,440
that I used to smoke it based on my

1455
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:42,298
tolerance but mind melting is actually

1456
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,720
how I would describe my experience

1457
00:59:42,298 --> 00:59:48,000
tonight with the pie screen oh yeah that

1458
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:49,798
like that was bomb yeah yeah that one

1459
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,960
that one tests that's the highest

1460
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:54,659
testing strain we've ever tested and and

1461
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,119
what's crazy so usually I I find this

1462
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:59,639
weird relationship or like lower testing

1463
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:02,220
THC sometimes as higher testing terpenes

1464
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:04,019
and like my general like made up

1465
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:06,000
anecdotal Theory from the little

1466
01:00:04,019 --> 01:00:07,739
evidence I have of it is would be that

1467
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,900
there's probably a limited amount of

1468
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:12,118
surface area for oils to present itself

1469
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:15,480
on the plant terpenes are oils as well

1470
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:17,700
as the as THC so by having more of one

1471
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,920
de facto you may limit it on another

1472
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:21,919
scale but the pie screen tests are like

1473
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,059
three and a half percent again

1474
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,900
non-adultured test

1475
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:30,720
um three and a half percent uh Terps and

1476
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:33,139
right just that about 40 uh total

1477
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:35,639
cannabinoids that's crazy that's awesome

1478
01:00:33,139 --> 01:00:38,519
pretty pretty pretty pretty mind melting

1479
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:40,858
and it's crazy to me how high it is

1480
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:43,500
yeah so we broke up earlier it smells so

1481
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:45,900
good it's nice right I just want to

1482
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,400
highlight that joint was amazing this is

1483
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,160
the first time I've ever smoked a straw

1484
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,680
Nana on a straw Nana before wow is this

1485
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,298
rosin inside of this rosin or rosin

1486
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:55,739
unstron and a flower

1487
01:00:54,298 --> 01:00:57,960
um I don't know about you Joe but to me

1488
01:00:55,739 --> 01:01:00,118
that's the essence is just insanely

1489
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,980
floral super sweet

1490
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:04,559
um that was trivial blessing to smoke

1491
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:06,838
delicious organic yeah puff it gently

1492
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,839
I'm not a professional hash hole roller

1493
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:13,199
but it'll work yeah I love the single

1494
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:15,619
origin max out on the flavor it's uh

1495
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:18,838
it's a thing of beauty and full season

1496
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:22,318
flower grown right and preserved

1497
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:25,199
properly is really a treat It's just sad

1498
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:27,358
it's so often treated as subpar so by

1499
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,699
the time it gets into most people's

1500
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:32,098
hands it's been oxidized and it's lost

1501
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:35,159
so much of its essence

1502
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:37,559
um I have a big jar of some straw Nana

1503
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:39,960
and some other huge you're gonna be mean

1504
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:42,599
[ __ ] packs of the future some huge

1505
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:45,318
nugs apples and bananas dude the apples

1506
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:49,019
big fluffy crazy things

1507
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:50,338
it was like huge like the spears you

1508
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:52,318
give it to us at the emeralds it was

1509
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:55,759
both when you came to LA and also when

1510
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:55,759
we went up to Emerald and ego

1511
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,179
you also had straw Nano when you came to

1512
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:05,640
visit in La though and I do have a

1513
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:08,519
little bit of that okay and it was good

1514
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:10,078
nice nice I just I can't I have no sense

1515
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:12,659
of time I thought it was like a really

1516
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,280
long time since I saw you guys okay dude

1517
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:17,338
it was five months

1518
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:20,579
what month is it

1519
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:22,858
oh [ __ ] yeah okay you're right yeah yeah

1520
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:24,240
you're totally right whoever and then

1521
01:02:22,858 --> 01:02:26,699
the when you came down and you saw the

1522
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:30,358
LA Organic Squirrel that was before that

1523
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:33,179
yeah okay that okay that was all right

1524
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:34,798
yeah cool I think it was drawn in well

1525
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:35,719
it was both I could be wrong it was both

1526
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,338
okay

1527
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:41,639
no there was also trouble uh Pink

1528
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:45,000
truffle something it's Whitney trucks

1529
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:46,679
it was outdoor yeah yeah okay

1530
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,599
so yeah there is a bunch of different

1531
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:50,759
things good stuff

1532
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:53,039
um the straw nana I just like I held

1533
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,900
back and I like I thought I didn't even

1534
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:58,699
take it out of the Keurig room for a

1535
01:02:54,900 --> 01:03:01,798
while but uh I guess I'm I'm mistaken

1536
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:05,098
well I I think uh whatever you gave us

1537
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:07,199
is dang yeah the apples and bananas that

1538
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:09,660
I think I also shared with you it was

1539
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:12,298
these gigantic really fluffy leafy buds

1540
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:15,000
just kind of a a random outdoor plant

1541
01:03:12,298 --> 01:03:17,099
that got lots of good compost and not

1542
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,920
much else

1543
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:22,160
um it came out at over five percent

1544
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:26,280
terms wow

1545
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:27,199
5.48 that's crazy but it was like the

1546
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,019
ugliest

1547
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:33,598
but you'd I I've grown in a long long

1548
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:35,280
time and I still have a big bag of it I

1549
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,640
just give them out and it's got such a

1550
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:41,000
wild smell this is straw straw than a

1551
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:41,000
squared

1552
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:47,940
yeah

1553
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:50,579
that is such an intense yeah it's like

1554
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:51,720
really enjoyable turn strawberry and

1555
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:53,880
bananas

1556
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:55,739
to the face

1557
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,539
like a smoothie

1558
01:03:55,739 --> 01:03:58,558
really enjoyable

1559
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:01,500
um

1560
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,420
and so yeah I guess so what are you

1561
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,099
both like most I guess we asked this

1562
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,900
question at the beginning but like what

1563
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:09,119
is you know your favorite thing to grow

1564
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,260
you've sort of said the the Ken but like

1565
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,940
what is your favorite thing to smoke

1566
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,859
that you grow

1567
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:18,019
me yeah oh

1568
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:18,019
um vaporizer you know

1569
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:23,639
if I okay like is a question like if I

1570
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:26,159
was on an island and I could pick one

1571
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:28,879
thing and that was it

1572
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:28,879
ice cream

1573
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:35,460
because I'll never I'll never it's the

1574
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:38,759
one strain that I have not managed to

1575
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:41,460
develop any kind of like

1576
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,380
um like cannabinoid tolerance to you

1577
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,119
know like certain strains you smoke it

1578
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,539
for a while and you start smoking

1579
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,539
something else

1580
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,659
yeah

1581
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:53,880
so so yeah that would be my pie stream

1582
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:55,980
but but I would have like different

1583
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,838
answers for different scenarios but if

1584
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,798
it was for the rest of my life ice cream

1585
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:00,900
yep

1586
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:04,519
you you win skunk Tech so you gotta

1587

knock out when you need it yeah yeah

1588
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:08,059
before yeah

1589
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:13,980
uh it would be because I actually like

1590
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:17,759

1591
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:21,240
