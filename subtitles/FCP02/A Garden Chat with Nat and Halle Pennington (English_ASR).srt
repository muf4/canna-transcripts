Humboldt seed company we've been here

33
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,299
since Hallie was a little tyke and um

34
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,679
right now

35
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:40,079
there's a bunch of other folks in the

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,540
kitchen they're cooking up some

37
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,158
something special so I I knew it would

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,560
be too crazy loud in there so hopefully

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
everybody hears it's okay I'm sure it'll

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,759
be okay we'll fix it up so a little

41
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,078
Sunday brunch going on

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,078
yeah yeah I think they're

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,880
there oh

44
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:06,478
the pantry area and they found some cans

45
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,419
of chickpeas that needed to get used so

46
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,098
yeah I I used to have an Armenian

47
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:16,878
girlfriend and her mother taught me how

48
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:16,878
to make hummus yes nice long time ago

49
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:20,759
we have our own garlic every year we do

50
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,659
like a little garlic

51
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:27,539
Garden we've been saving the seeds for

52
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,219
too long that I can remember and uh so

53
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:31,859
this is the time of year where it's like

54
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,900
you got to use it or else it doesn't

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,480
stick around much longer and and we're

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,539
about to harvest the other big patch of

57
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,280
it over there too so oh how cool I'm

58
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:45,239
trying trying to grow some food as well

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,180
so far I've only got arugula basil uh

60
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,519
cilantro and Italian parsley

61
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,620
but it's a start about to start

62
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,039
somewhere yeah well when I moved out

63
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,840
here in 1995 the first thing I did just

64
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,299
right down the road in the little town

65
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,598
of Orleans in Humboldt County is where

66
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,879
most of the farmers market Farms are for

67
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,979
humble and Humboldt has of course

68
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,959
Humboldt State University which is now

69
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:13,139
Cal Poly humble

70
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,300
and Arcata it's one of the bigger

71
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,818
farmers markets on the whole West Coast

72
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,560
as far as at least it was at one point

73
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:21,179
in time it was the biggest in the

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,259
country

75
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,620
uh

76
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:28,079
so when I came out here I was 18 and I

77
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,480
needed work I'd you know basically

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,400
hitchhiked my way out here and and I

79
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,479
worked on these Organic Farms down there

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,739
in The Big Valley and that was really

81
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:43,919
like what made growing cannabis

82
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:47,280
uh sort of natural for me was not like

83
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,639
necessarily going on to the you know

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,680
the internet sites and like having to

85
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,798
you know buy all the fancy ingredients

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,219
but just like knowing the basis of

87
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,739
organic farming was really I feel like

88
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:04,439
it made a huge difference for me I was

89
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,259
like well this stuff is seems a lot like

90
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,840
the tomatoes and all we did to those

91
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,780
because this that and the other and boom

92
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,299
we had tomatoes Galore so I'm gonna try

93
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,680
that next thing I know it's like yeah I

94
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:21,660
got a lot of ganja out of that

95
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,840
yeah I've been trying to not buy any

96
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,479
more soil and just re you know keep the

97
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,758
soil alive and you know maybe add a

98
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,500
little worm castings or whatever needs

99
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,400
to be done I've even tried some compost

100
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:39,240
pots and uh I got a 45 gallon pot that

101
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:41,459
I'm composting in but yeah organic is

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,519
the way to go I believe

103
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:47,399
yeah always tastes better that way yeah

104
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:50,060
you know and I I heard that um it's

105
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,060
better for you

106
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:56,639
we're always talking about the Tomato

107
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,300
analogy you're like yeah that tomato

108
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,620
that you see in Safeway looks perfect

109
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,360
and

110
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,540
I mean I can see right through it to be

111
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,460
honest I'm like yeah tasteless it's

112
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,259
shaped nice there's no like it's not a

113
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,239
single spot on it or anything like that

114
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,759
but I can see like

115
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,120
literally I can see the weird mealy

116
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,080
texture inside of it yeah one of my

117
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,819
biggest

118
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,819
Pepe growing up with him out here is

119
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:28,079
pricey salad or something like that and

120
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,360
it says heirloom tomatoes and you're

121
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,000
expecting these beautiful like super

122
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,120
flavorful amazing tomato and you get

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,600
served one of those like nasty mealy GMO

124
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,280
tomatoes and I mean it just the most

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,800
disappointing thing after you've had

126
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,399
like endless perfect fresh tomatoes all

127
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,579
summer long so yeah well

128
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,138
yeah I I like heirloom tomatoes if

129
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,418
they're really heirloom you know they

130
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,160
they seem to be the better tasting of

131
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:59,219
the ones that I find at Whole Foods or

132
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,520
somewhere like that but uh and maybe try

133
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,520
growing some tomatoes and I mean I

134
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:09,418
we always said like cannabis is the

135
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,939
garden gateway drug and it's like seen a

136
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,978
lot of people get you know grow some

137
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,139
some weed plants because they you know

138
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,478
want to smoke their own which is awesome

139
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,100
there's no nothing wrong with that but

140
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,740
it's I think it's cool that it gets

141
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,600
people just back in touch with you know

142
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,300
playing around with growing things

143
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,360
nature and all that good stuff and yeah

144
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,520
we've got basil and Arlo Garden here

145
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,460
we've got our Auto flowers right behind

146
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,620
us I don't know if you can see them but

147
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:40,918
we'll go on we'll go on a little tour

148
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,899
okay if you will walk around the spot

149
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,019
excellent

150
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:48,839
so you know I I've been doing my

151
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,459
research as usual and uh

152
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,638
well

153
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:57,180
what really uh something that caught my

154
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,160
eye was uh your five questions with

155
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,939
Forbes Magazine but

156
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,580
that was cool I have more than five so

157
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,379
let's let me start here

158
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:10,680
um I read somewhere that you were

159
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:12,959
registering strains in Colombia now are

160
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,120
are those like Colombian strains or your

161
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,459
strains and how do you register a strain

162
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,360
in Colombia

163
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,359
so yeah that's

164
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:29,038
have been definitely putting ourselves

165
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,099
out there across the country

166
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:31,098
um

167
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,899
earthquake alert

168
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,199
well it's a good thing you're outside

169
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,538
yeah I

170
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,840
it's a 6.0

171
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:49,019
off the coast of Northern California

172
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,758
but uh we're not there we're inland

173
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,318
it's far enough and humble that this

174
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,060
earthquake's probably not affecting us

175
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,740
but that's yeah that's a pretty

176
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,598
significant earthquake it looks like

177
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,579
it's happening right now

178
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,519
in uh

179
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:05,219
maybe near you know our office on the

180
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,439
coast and well I hope everybody's okay

181
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,599
well we'll find out I'll ask my wife to

182
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,978
check get up on everybody out there so

183
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,199
we don't have to interrupt the interview

184
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:15,418
I mean as people might

185
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,180
know earthquakes are kind of a normal

186
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,378
thing yep I've lived through two big

187
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,139
ones down here

188
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:26,479
Egypt just recently had some decent ones

189
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:29,759
uh I'm talking about what was it uh

190
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:32,399
71 and 94.

191
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,200
right right when like freeways fell down

192
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,200
and you know you know

193
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:41,098
so Ali you were there for the the one on

194
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,860
the coast what'd you that was the Wild

195
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,540
Ride wasn't it yeah definitely we've got

196
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,278
a few good ones in the last few years

197
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,799
honestly there's been a few that are

198
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,080
that are like are long drawn out ones so

199
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,179
it'll be just shaking and oh for long

200
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,980
enough for you to sit there and be like

201
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:59,539
all right

202
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,220
[Laughter]

203
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:05,099
the earthquake

204
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:09,139
all right here we go get that back okay

205
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,139
professional camera adjuster

206
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,360
um did it turn upside down on you or

207
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,139
anything no uh I I think I saw the

208
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,000
little

209
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,740
the stand that you're

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,980
putting your phone on

211
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,720
yeah we did we have our phone on a

212
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,000
little stand

213
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,180
okay all righty

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,200
so back to you um registering strains in

215
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:35,219
Colombia

216
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,180
yeah so as cannabis kind of becomes you

217
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,600
know

218
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:42,479
legal or whatever regulated across the

219
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,759
the globe we obviously want to

220
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,860
participate I mean we feel like we

221
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,799
definitely have something to share

222
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,459
an offer and so

223
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,219
um

224
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:57,000
in Colombia it's they they have this

225
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,800
very onerous process that it's a lot of

226
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,480
comp or a lot of countries I think

227
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,599
should probably try to avoid but it's

228
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,360
what it does is it makes it if you want

229
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,120
to produce cannabis

230
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,740
you have this very long several year

231
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,679
process to

232
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:17,220
get your strain or cultivar they would

233
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:20,159
probably call it uh registered and so

234
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,899
yeah we did initiate that process we do

235
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,620
have one our blueberry muffin is

236
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:28,440
registered down there but it's it's uh

237
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,539
it's a little bit ridiculous because as

238
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,140
I'm sure anybody who's interested in

239
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:37,139
cannabis in the United States is aware

240
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:38,639
we're as breeders collectively you know

241
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,580
whether just in the U.S or even

242
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,699
internationally we're like very quickly

243
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,519
coming up with new varieties so if you

244
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,440
have something that I mean our blueberry

245
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,778
muffin seems to withstand the test of

246
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,980
time but generally

247
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:58,860
you know two thumbs up on that one

248
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:01,560
that lifetime the lifespan of a cannabis

249
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,200
variety or strain is not

250
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,539
necessarily super long unfortunately so

251
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,959
it had been I mean the OG Kush of course

252
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:11,639
was popular forever but I mean of course

253
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,018
there's going to be some Classics that

254
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,120
always stay around I think you know our

255
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,459
blueberry muffin was a great option for

256
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,860
this project because you know that's one

257
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:23,338
that I'll smoke probably until I'm you

258
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,200
know about to grow basically so but

259
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:28,019
there are things that you know we at

260
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
least have new better crosses of new

261
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,399
versions of and even for the blueberry

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,100
muffin for example you know we've we've

263
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,440
made our blueberry cupcake lines and so

264
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,800
we're always hunting and looking for the

265
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:45,260
next best thing and yeah it's hard to

266
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,259
commit to you know the one thing and

267
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,778
so I think it's interesting I think you

268
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,399
know the the guess is is that either

269
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:56,278
that's going to be one of those rules

270
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,360
down there that doesn't always just you

271
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,059
know that a lot of people just

272
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,000
collectively decide to ignore

273
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,578
and but nonetheless yes that's been an

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,940
effort to get some things registered

275
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:11,759
down there and and a valiant effort

276
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,740
that's that's been you know Ben Ben Lynn

277
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,778
kind of has been

278
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,240
going out and

279
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:20,639
sort of reaching out to some of those

280
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,799
International markets but they're which

281
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,519
is great but you know we've seen a lot

282
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:29,099
of them are as sort of volatile or even

283
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,159
more volatile than what we see in

284
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,720
California and the US in general where

285
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,259
you know you can make your very very

286
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,720
best guess about what the smartest

287
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:43,980
move is to have a

288
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:47,820
you know at least sustainable business

289
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,740
and you can totally be it's

290
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,019
but I think it's a great for us to dip

291
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,639
our toes into in a sense because also

292
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,700
like as you mentioned it's so volatile

293
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,320
that we don't know that you know in the

294
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,940
next few years regulations couldn't

295
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,060
require that you know all over the place

296
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,639
for us to even do interstate so yeah um

297
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:07,679
you know for gear up and be prepared to

298
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,620
end up in that position if we absolutely

299
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,000
have to I mean by all means I would like

300
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,980
to have witness as much paperwork as

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,980
possible but that's just not the reality

302
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,500
anymore of this industry yeah hey were

303
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,600
you able to like locate any of the old

304
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,919
good Colombians trains and bring them

305
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,379
back

306
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,479
yeah there was some um I know Ben

307
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,578
brought some Colombian strands back we

308
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,399
went down to Jamaica if people watch our

309
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:35,939
YouTube we've got a cool uh video about

310
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,100
collecting land land races uh in Jamaica

311
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,720
and

312
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,659
you know the interesting thing about

313
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,660
that is is that things have changed so

314
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:48,299
much in the last 20 years that while it

315
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:51,600
is really cool to incorporate those

316
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:54,240
genetics into

317
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,180
new efforts and new breeding

318
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,200
techniques and practices

319
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,379
um

320
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,620
for us it's what we are very comfortable

321
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:06,720
growing the land race genetics ourselves

322
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,299
because we don't

323
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,259
have expectations we don't

324
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:15,719
depend on producing flour and having it

325
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:18,600
be a certain way

326
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,360
to make our living where because we're

327
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,100
strictly looking for seeds and new you

328
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
know

329
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,100
you see though it's getting windy a

330
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,959
little bit you've seen varieties but

331
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,600
anyways

332
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,819
land races are

333
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,100
are great and they sound very romantic

334
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:40,440
of course you're like you know oh I know

335
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,579
this land race from from Columbia or

336
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,720
Jamaica that's been around forever and

337
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:48,539
the problem is is that you know we

338
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,420
haven't even had the concept of seedless

339
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:54,480
cannabis hasn't really been a thing for

340
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:57,539
that long and so

341
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,820
except for in Thailand

342
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:01,519
the seedless they yeah that was the

343
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,579
first seedless I ever saw

344
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,578
right right

345
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,679
um

346
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,078
yeah yeah it's high sticks yeah that

347
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,719
they must have just been really on it

348
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,239
with that huh oh yeah from Thailand

349
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,240
right yeah and you know

350
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,079
um I've grown what what was purported to

351
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,899
be

352
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,778
land race tie and it's nothing it's like

353
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,698
something that Mom like the hemp from

354
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:29,639
the Hmong tribe mixed with something

355
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:31,139
else and it's you know but the funny

356
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,399
thing is and I was arguing with somebody

357
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,079
about it and telling them they don't

358
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,480
know what they're talking about

359
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,219
like five days later I'm in Whole Foods

360
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,839
I'm waiting for the elevator to go up to

361
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,660
the bathroom and some guy comes in and

362
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,720
we start talking and he says he like

363
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:48,778
lived in Thailand for a while and I so I

364
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,399
asked him and you know if he speaks time

365
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:52,320
we start speaking Thai to each other

366
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,139
waiting for the

367
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,120
the elevator and then

368
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,799
we have this whole conversation in Thai

369
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,440
and then we go to the bathroom and come

370
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:05,219
back down and he takes me out to his car

371
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,899
and he's as old as I am right and spent

372
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,540
time in the military and has been living

373
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,519
in Thailand for like the last well maybe

374
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,740
besides the last two years about 10

375
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,339
years before that and a long time before

376
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,680
that long story short he opens his trunk

377
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:22,320
pull there's a big bag he pulls out two

378
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,659
giant nuggies I smell him I haven't

379
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,680
smelled that since 82.

380
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:31,319
right and so he's like kind of a ski bum

381
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,879
guy and I probably won't see him again

382
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,940
until

383
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,820
like the snow is melted but he's got the

384
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,199
seeds and I know where he's we talked

385
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,519
about where he sourced him he got him

386
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,879
from uh

387
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,039
uh chief of police in a in a location I

388
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,458
will not divulge at the moment

389
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,639
but uh it's the real tie and so

390
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:55,919
uh maybe we'll one day we'll get that to

391
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:00,600
you that that's something worth having

392
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:02,958
well we we had we had tie strains

393
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,959
about

394
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,679
supposedly of course but um they were

395
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,780
the one of some of the most Frosty

396
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,819
beautiful

397
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:19,078
cannabis buds that we had on the farm

398
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:21,298
that year and I was be thrilled and you

399
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:24,000
know cross some things into them but but

400
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:28,318
then of course you know we got into the

401
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,558
world of of testing cannabis potency and

402
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,720
they were testing like 13 a lot of

403
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,819
people you would assume that the frost

404
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,620
and the trichomes that you see on buds

405
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:40,200
are

406
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:43,739
somehow correlated to the potency the

407
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,600
THC potency at least I should say and

408
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,880
that's that's not the case at all you

409
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:51,359
can have some of the most Frosty

410
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:55,440
beautiful looking flowers come back

411
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,719
testing you know 10 percent

412
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,058
um it's always disappointing when that

413
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,160
is the case and but they you know they

414
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:04,079
probably have cannabinoids in there that

415
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,120
we just don't know we're not smart

416
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,759
enough to look for yet and that's the

417
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:12,479
thing is that that's the huge problem

418
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:14,759
with basing any kind of decision on the

419
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,419
laboratory results that we have right

420
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:20,879
now in in like you know wanting to

421
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,160
it's tough for us with breeding it's

422
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,360
sort of like you know having to choose

423
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,038
between

424
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,558
you know whether we're making our

425
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:32,940
customers happy

426
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:37,558
or we're following our passions or we're

427
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:40,440
and you know clearly there's no denying

428
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:43,740
that cannabis that doesn't test very

429
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,900
high doesn't sell and right so if

430
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,000
growing commercially

431
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,100
then why in the world would you grow

432
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,798
something that you can't sell and that's

433
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:54,779
that's all just very basic logic yeah

434
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,879
and there's no getting around it like

435
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:59,940
unless you're some kind of an

436
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,559
independently wealthy trust fund you

437
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,360
know people are always like giving us a

438
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,178
hard time like

439
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,399
you know oh why do you you know worry

440
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:11,700
about the THC or whatever and we're just

441
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,380
like because we just don't we're not we

442
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,160
don't have tons of money right we're not

443
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:19,500
like we're doing this as a business

444
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,058
it's a business and unfortunately like

445
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,919
we haven't taken any investment money

446
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,839
and we don't have

447
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,720
even if we had you know like our

448
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:32,759
investors would be even more on us about

449
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:35,400
doing just high THC varieties so but I

450
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,440
mean the overall goal is the business

451
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,259
needs to at least pay for itself yeah

452
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,000
right yeah involves having some high

453
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,400
testers in the Arsenal if we didn't

454
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,440
break even we would you know we wouldn't

455
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,240
just it just wouldn't happen because we

456
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,340
wouldn't have the work people working we

457
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,380
wouldn't have the you know I mean the

458
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:54,599
goddamn licenses are so freaking

459
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,280
expensive and

460
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:58,558
but it's getting a little better they've

461
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,839
realized that they you know made some

462
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:04,740
mistakes I think at the state level and

463
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:07,339
at the even at the local level but yeah

464
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,140
I saw something about taxes being

465
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:12,599
bundled into a different um

466
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,320
category or getting rid of some and just

467
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:18,779
making one the United cannabis Business

468
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,939
Association down here was

469
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:23,339
working with this I think it was a state

470
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,558
I don't know exactly the outcome of that

471
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,599
there's good things happening there's

472
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,639
good stuff whether it was it's too

473
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,839
little too late is yet to be seen I mean

474
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,940
I it there are so many big Mega Farms

475
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,220
like you know there are

476
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,500
many that are over 100 acres at this

477
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,519
point and

478
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,798
um

479
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,798
there's just a lot of like real irony in

480
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:49,440
the industry that you just it makes you

481
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:53,279
wonder whether there is a greater

482
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,558
sort of plan to just kind of take it

483
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,960
away from people that may have been

484
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:00,720
rebellious in in

485
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,298
the original growing of it you know sort

486
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,440
of oh yeah well once people just get

487
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:07,200
their hands on

488
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,298
what's that I said once politicians get

489
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,819
their hands on it I think you know which

490
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:13,740
they kind of already have since they are

491
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,859
in charge of legislation and things like

492
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:20,880
that it just kind of uh ruins the whole

493
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:22,918
uh Cosmic Vibe of it

494
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,419
crazy now because you know we're seeing

495
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,520
like even

496
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,440
what 40 minutes down the road from us

497
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,418
there was a facility built out that I

498
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,120
think took around 18 million dollars

499
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:36,299
investment and it's now going up for

500
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,099
auction at 3.5 million and so if you

501
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:39,658
think about it like that opens the door

502
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:41,579
for all these people that just kind of

503
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,260
walked right in and be like all right

504
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:45,678
you know this is nice this is already

505
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,200
all set up you're not a great day

506
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:52,620
well it was 40. crazy they took 40

507
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,298
million in Investments to make it and I

508
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:57,739
I mean it's worth what it's worth it's

509
00:21:54,298 --> 00:22:00,658
like unfortunately that

510
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,759
36 million dollars is

511
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:06,059
those investors

512
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,740
are bonds you know it's gone I mean yeah

513
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,298
you're right though somebody could jump

514
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,640
in and

515
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:13,500
swoop it up and at least make it you

516
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,919
know fairly profitable if they only have

517
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,859
to pay 3.5 right I know it seems bizarre

518
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:23,100
it's such a bizarre thing I mean

519
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:25,439
yeah but you know there were

520
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:27,839
I would say like the pendulum swings and

521
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,179
so humble we still have this like

522
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,579
incredible knowledge and wealth of

523
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,419
experience of people that have held out

524
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:34,678
here

525
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,559
and

526
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:40,440
we lost some of them though to like

527
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:42,798
really easy mistakes and I mean when

528
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,700
when people were around us like taking

529
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,859
millions and millions of dollars in

530
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,380
investment money

531
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:51,658
we were somewhat kind of like oh crap

532
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,280
you know are we gonna be able to

533
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:56,419
survive

534
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,418
even though we're in something

535
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,500
I'm so sorry that's all right even

536
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,820
though we're something that's like

537
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,819
here Holly maybe you can help

538
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,558
I'll just hold it for a minute like even

539
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,319
if we had a

540
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,440
weren't like a totally different Niche

541
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,439
um

542
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,700
it still was scary you know I we were

543
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,700
like shoot what are we gonna do you know

544
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,580
and one of the sad things was that the

545
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,220
um I think that'll work great

546
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:34,859
one of the sad things was that the

547
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,860
the county and some of the

548
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:41,339
elected officials were kind of like took

549
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:42,719
those projects more seriously than the

550
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:44,699
small local

551
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,900
person that had been here for a long

552
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,900
time and

553
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,480
and so we we were kind of always getting

554
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,460
you know our applications and permit

555
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,360
documents and things were getting sort

556
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,500
of

557
00:23:54,359 --> 00:24:01,678
uh attention last so let's just say or

558
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,460
or cast to the side

559
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,860
somewhat it felt like and and the ones

560
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,079
that were like oh yeah we just got you

561
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:11,219
know got another 10 million dollars from

562
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,579
some

563
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,400
rich person that and

564
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:20,000
you know so now we've got we'll do

565
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,798
whatever you want us to do as far as our

566
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,538
applications and blah blah blah 10

567
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,980
Consultants writing the whole entire

568
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:28,740
thing for him I mean you should have

569
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,900
seen this first initial application that

570
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,960
he submitted and he wrote pretty much

571
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,179
all of it himself it was like a binder

572
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,340
this thick yeah it was like he wrote an

573
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,100
awful

574
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:43,740
it was beyond Master's thesis it was and

575
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,279
you know I I had experience writing

576
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,140
grants and writing

577
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:51,359
environmental documents and reports for

578
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,820
the Klamath River and the salmon and all

579
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,798
that stuff so yep thank God I had that

580
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:58,740
because a lot of people that

581
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,740
that didn't you know

582
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,558
the Consultants are are helpful and

583
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,058
great but sometimes you know they just

584
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,859
you know they're

585
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:09,839
they're not like

586
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:13,019
if your project doesn't make it through

587
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:15,418
they're not out of a job they have 20

588
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:18,658
projects right so there's not a lot of

589
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:21,080
real care and knowledge going into it I

590
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:21,080
mean I don't want to

591
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:27,178
I mean there are Consultants that could

592
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,140
have done way better than I did but it

593
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:33,360
the fact that I didn't I think made when

594
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,820
I would call the county and say what's

595
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,278
going on I haven't you know heard back

596
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:39,778
or or I just want to you know you to

597
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:41,519
tell me that at least I'm in good

598
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:43,740
standing now because you know you

599
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,298
haven't been communicative and and I

600
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,038
know I turned everything in that I was

601
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:49,200
supposed to and I see

602
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,558
you know Joe down the road just got

603
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,360
hauled off in handcuffs last week and I

604
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,879
don't really want that to happen to my

605
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,379
family and I so am I good or what and

606
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,659
they'd be like

607
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,179
obviously here's your application oh

608
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:05,100
okay you are your own consultant or

609
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,259
you're writing all the documents I'm

610
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,959
like yup and they're like

611
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:11,700
actually yeah you are good they're

612
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,460
always like we've never seen it done

613
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:18,840
like this but we can't poke any holes in

614
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,000
it so that's cool uh you know I wrote my

615
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,579
own uh conscientious subjector

616
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,859
application for the U.S Navy as of the

617
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:28,139
first Buddhist uh conscientious

618
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:30,778
subjectured on the grounds of Bad Karma

619
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,880
and I actually succeeded

620
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:35,099
um no lawyer would take my case but what

621
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,778
you know so yeah

622
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,379
um

623
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:39,179
so

624
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,820
another thing I read

625
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:46,159
that you've developed scratch and sniff

626
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:48,058
cannabis samples is that true now

627
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,820
is that

628
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:53,538
a long time ago it was actually my wife

629
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:56,158
Amber in there you remember when yeah

630
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:58,079
sounds forever well it didn't really

631
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,400
take off the first time though you know

632
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,319
I think we're a little ahead of the

633
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,880
times Maybe

634
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,339
I'm not trying to brag it's actually

635
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,659
it's a freaking pain in our ass we're

636
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:09,199
always kind of like a little ahead of

637
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,200
our time

638
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:15,899
was it the tissue culture lab in my old

639
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,679
bedroom when we were doing we were doing

640
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,600
tissue culture in 2015-16 and it we kind

641
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,940
of realized at that point kind of like

642
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,759
ah this has some good utility but it's

643
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,220
not like and now it's like you know been

644
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,859
the hottest new thing to do across the

645
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,620
entire industry for the last right three

646
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:36,479
years to get a lot faster money if you

647
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,079
want if you mention those words little

648
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,079
buzzwords

649
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:45,778
its advantages maybe it's a clean a

650
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:49,079
genetic or just to preserve something

651
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:52,140
for a long period of time for any kind

652
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:54,240
of like you know scale production it's

653
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,640
just uh not the most practical option

654
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,079
it's onerous and slow and it takes a

655
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,179
really long time for the plants to come

656
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,519
out of tissue culture whereas like with

657
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,740
seeds they are actually cleaner than

658
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,278
tissue culture

659
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,620
entirely like nothing tissue culture can

660
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:12,720
still have hop latent virus whereas the

661
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:15,959
seed is very very unlikely to have it

662
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,058
inside the embryo yeah

663
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,140
and then you know seeds come out of

664
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:21,538
their shell

665
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,538
raring and ready to go

666
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:28,019
and catch up and surpass clones as far

667
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:29,038
as like how big you can get a plant in

668
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:30,798
no time

669
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:34,919
and uh

670
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:38,538
tissue culture kind of like creeped back

671
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:41,460
into reality you know it's sort of like

672
00:28:38,538 --> 00:28:43,079
needs to wake up it has a long long slow

673
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,840
wake up but we don't want to just sit

674
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,778
around a dish tissue culture I mean if

675
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,899
there's a greenhouse right over here

676
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:54,179
that if my Wi-Fi was a little better I

677
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,860
I'd just go walk with you but we'll try

678
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,460
it but anyway

679
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:01,079
um

680
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:04,558
we had blueberry muffin in there and

681
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:07,079
what was it that it made me ask Amber

682
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:09,778
anyway so my wife Amber was like if you

683
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:12,720
could just make a scratch and sniff

684
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:14,759
with this smell here and

685
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,278
because it's such a potently smelling

686
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,720
strain and um

687
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:20,519
she was like that would just people

688
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,819
would love that and I was like oh man

689
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,500
you're right and so I just said

690
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:27,480
you know and the first time we did it we

691
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,659
did it with the magazine and we we had

692
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,360
uh the Turpin extraction which you know

693
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:36,059
Ben has done super into the Turpin

694
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:39,599
extraction he does that a ton and so

695
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:42,119
that's been amazing but you know got

696
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,158
that and then found a place that would

697
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:47,038
you know do the process of actually

698
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,380
turning it into something that lasts a

699
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,640
long time in the scratch and sniff ink

700
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,460
type form

701
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,278
and uh it's a fairly natural process and

702
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:59,038
it really you're just taking the plants

703
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,119
essence you know the essential oil and

704
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,460
and

705
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,398
putting it into a

706
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,940
you know a format that

707
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:13,079
is not only is like lasts a long time

708
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:16,259
and easy to share but it also doesn't

709
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:18,058
have cannabinoids in it because

710
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:21,359
that's the only thing that really leaves

711
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:24,178
behind so it it really takes all of the

712
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:27,298
the essence the turpins and the Esters

713
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,500
and and the flavonoids and all the

714
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:31,019
different things there are so many

715
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,778
things beyond turpins that make up the

716
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,519
real smell of cannabis right and it

717
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:39,538
carries all of those

718
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:42,658
but it won't carry the the waxy

719
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:46,220
uh compounds that are cannabinoids and

720
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:49,260
so leaving those behind

721
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,839
may affect the

722
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:53,700
smell ever so slightly but but we feel

723
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,678
like

724
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,798
I mean you get the benefit is that it

725
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,259
it's completely and totally legal as you

726
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,599
know a non-thc

727
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:05,700
you know whatever it's not even happen

728
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,219
this doesn't have anything in it that's

729
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,120
a controlled substance so maybe there's

730
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,620
a perfume in line in the future

731
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,439
we did we worked with a brand that made

732
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:18,599
a perfume line and a cologne line out of

733
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,840
our cannabinoids we're out of our

734
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:25,219
turpents excuse me the blueberry or what

735
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:27,720
hey what was it fog and trees yeah yeah

736
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,019
that might have been a tad bit ahead of

737
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,880
it it was ahead of its time yeah

738
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:35,940
you know part of it still had such a

739
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,559
stigma around it almost and I I first

740
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,380
smelled it and I was like this smells

741
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:42,720
amazing I love it I love the idea but I

742
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,640
also was just imagining whoever squirts

743
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,919
them on their wrist and then hops in the

744
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,259
car and accidentally gets pulled over on

745
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,059
their way to work

746
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:54,240
I was like ah this is gonna be a hard

747
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:57,720
one to explain in some situations

748
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,000
hey when you guys so we did to your

749
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,038
original question okay we're we're like

750
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,960
the tangent Masters here that's all

751
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:05,940
right I like tangents

752
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,360
I I told Hallie because I used to do

753
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,100
interviews for the salmon stuff and have

754
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,859
sometimes these like

755
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:16,199
you know press would actually want to

756
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:18,178
like rattle you and stuff and I'd always

757
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,519
be like you know it doesn't matter what

758
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,640
they ask just talk about what you want

759
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,440
to talk about

760
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,500
so apologies that that probably carries

761
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,440
over sometimes well we did do a salmon

762
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,480
uh interview one time if you remember

763
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,360
about that yeah well you know now the

764
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,240
dams will officially be 100 out of the

765
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:42,240
Klamath River next year right end of

766
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,759
next fall yes so the first stand will be

767
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,259
gone this year at the end of this fall

768
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,359
you can't really do a lot of this stuff

769
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,538
over the winter just because of the high

770
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,538
flow and but then by next fall

771
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:55,798
um they will have a completely

772
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:59,158
free-flowing Klamath River

773
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:01,440
wow and yeah like that as I've told

774
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,740
people a million times these are like

775
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,220
Antiquated dams and they don't produce

776
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,740
but like the power grid when Pacific or

777
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,380
was in negotiations with us we would

778
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,419
talk about that and they would you know

779
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,519
we had a guy take us to the side and he

780
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:21,720
was like you know what if we were to

781
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,778
just shut off the the uh

782
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,058
breaker for Klamath Dam projects we

783
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:29,819
wouldn't even see the needle on our

784
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:30,898
overall grid move like it would move as

785
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:32,879
much as

786
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:35,759
you know

787
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,519
like it's nothing he they were basically

788
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,898
like it's and and the fact is that every

789
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,259
single year

790
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:45,959
we have to build 13

791
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:48,119
facilities that produce

792
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,000
the equivalent amount of power as those

793
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,038
dams so people are always like oh you're

794
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,720
taking out all these you know like what

795
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:55,980
what they would call renewable energy

796
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,500
and it's like

797
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,839
you know this this destroyed

798
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,819
like the entire salmon run the third

799
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:06,359
largest salmon run on the west coast of

800
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:09,059
the United States and

801
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:12,118
you know where every single year we have

802
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:14,338
to build for 13 of these things and to

803
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,800
get that salmon run back we have to

804
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:18,838
build 14 one year you know like what the

805
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,820
[ __ ] that doesn't you know there's

806
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:22,199
nothing no difference there and they

807
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,000
don't store water

808
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,158
they they

809
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,139
you know they don't control floods

810
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,659
because they have to be maintained full

811
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,740
for the power plants to run it's just

812
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:35,720
this whole

813
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:40,079
terrible design of you know the

814
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:42,779
1930s 40s 50s I mean no

815
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,940
you know no disrespects to those

816
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,679
Engineers but they just didn't think

817
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,720
about this kind of stuff back then it

818
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,398
was just like you know oh there's more

819
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,699
salmon than you could ever want I mean

820
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:52,699
they had

821
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,659
you know like if you go into the I

822
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,039
always say like back then there was so

823
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:02,460
much salmon that they never could have

824
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:04,500
dreamed that it would be a a problem

825
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,880
it's happened so fast if you really

826
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,980
think about it like

827
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,800
fail too I mean that's not that much

828
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,260
time realistically from 1930s so now

829
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,780
it's devastating what has happened so

830
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,900
the impacts the negative impacts to

831
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:25,140
benefit ratio is just it's like you know

832
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:25,139
completely uh out of whack in life yeah

833
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:34,139
the last time that I even you know went

834
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:36,659
further than knee-deep in that River

835
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:38,159
just because it's so disgusting I don't

836
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:39,960
you know I don't let my dog near it

837
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,480
because if he drinks the water he can

838
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,880
die in the summer

839
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,320
yeah

840
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,380
but we wrapped down it but I don't mean

841
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,240
I don't I don't but at certain times yes

842
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,280
at certain times there's like warnings

843
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,759
and it's like you know and it's because

844
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,859
of this these unnatural algal blooms

845
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,440
that happen in the reservoirs right

846
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:03,358
right that will be gone so it's really

847
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,800
exciting for us and it's it's exciting

848
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,559
for I think a lot of the Pacific

849
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,119
Northwest because you know people just

850
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:11,400
don't understand

851
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,380
I mean we're in California but we are

852
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,139
part of the Pacific Northwest here in

853
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,380
Humboldt County and that's I mean we

854
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:21,598
have redwoods and we have you know

855
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,300
coniferous forest and you know look

856
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,660
right behind us you know that's

857
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,940
and obviously it's not rainy all year

858
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:31,679
and we still have like that's one of the

859
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,280
beauties of humble and why I think

860
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:39,179
cannabis became so popular from here is

861
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,099
you know we have this very unique

862
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:43,319
um climate that is

863
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:46,320
you know partly

864
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,460
cold nights and you know last night it

865
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,160
was probably

866
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,619
50 degrees 40 degrees

867
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,899
we had a little campfire and had you

868
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:58,920
know s'mores because we had friends over

869
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,720
but uh you could do that all summer long

870
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,760
and humble that's one of the things I

871
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,879
love about Humboldt is like it always

872
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,940
cools off enough that you can

873
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,980
enjoy enjoy the evening enjoy the

874
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,380
evening

875
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,820
and then you know today it doesn't feel

876
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,539
like it's going to get quite as hot but

877
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:21,260
yesterday it was got to the 90s I'm sure

878
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:24,179
so um plants love that

879
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:27,240
so I was going to ask you guys

880
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:30,179
um how many states are you in and does

881
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:34,578
the market different differ from each

882
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:37,559
state to state I mean

883
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:39,300
it definitely is pretty different in

884
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:41,159
every state it's one thing that we've

885
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,579
kind of had to adapt to I mean there's

886
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:45,779
some places that have legalized and gone

887
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:48,539
in that direction but haven't really

888
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:52,019
ruled out regulation and so you know as

889
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:54,000
someone who's trying to establish uh you

890
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,679
know very serious brain somewhere it's

891
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,539
hard for us to jump into those doors

892
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,699
like you know New York for example has

893
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:01,619
been a little bit of a tricky one we

894
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,858
wouldn't want to you know get a property

895
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:06,599
or make any big decisions until they let

896
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:09,719
us know you know what is going to be

897
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,420
okay and what isn't so yeah

898
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:14,759
yeah we did do

899
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:18,720
a little satellite in New York and kind

900
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,940
of had a nursery operation and made it

901
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,759
so that people could get

902
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,338
seeds in as legal of a way as they could

903
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,820
or even gets plants in as legal of a way

904
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:32,519
as they could in New York last year

905
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,039
so many people like the state didn't

906
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,659
really have it together I mean it's not

907
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,000
their fault it's no one's fault but it

908
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:41,879
just like we were kind of ahead of our

909
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,239
time a little bit I think and yeah and

910
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,260
you know we didn't need to have that

911
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:50,639
significant of a

912
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,599
of an offering over there and and so you

913
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,980
know we were there though and we

914
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,240
definitely met a lot of people and it

915
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,699
was really helpful for a lot of people

916
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:59,459
that we were there it made it so that

917
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:01,500
maybe we broke even instead of you know

918
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,780
making any money but that's just the way

919
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,980
it goes sometimes and

920
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,579
um

921
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:11,039
uh I think you know you live and learn

922
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,980
and it's like

923
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,960
it's all just part of the process of

924
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,099
there's a lot to complain about we have

925
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,440
a lot to

926
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:21,180
be thankful about I think in some

927
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,159
respects just

928
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:23,940
being that we have this Niche and that

929
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,719
we

930
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,720
you know like

931
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,338
I started

932
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,220
reading cannabis in in

933
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:38,099
1997 in Humboldt and is my youngest

934
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:40,349
daughter here hi there

935
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,640
so you know that was

936
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:45,000
[Music]

937
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:47,239
great timing you know what I mean I had

938
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,159
and

939
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:52,439
uh saw that there would be a need to

940
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,399
have seeds and new types of cannabis and

941
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,740
so

942
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,660
really followed that passion and stuck

943
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:00,659
to it and

944
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:00,659
established

945
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:06,180
go ahead sorry sorry what were your

946
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,980
original cultivars that you started with

947
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:09,719
way back then

948
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,179
well it was somewhat before they really

949
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:14,098
had I mean before cannabis was had so

950
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:16,980
many names you know it was kind of like

951
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:18,359
still pretty clandestine and

952
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,880
so

953
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:25,440
some of the very best things that I

954
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,720
came across as breeding and selecting

955
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,358
and selling cannabis

956
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:32,279
in the medical you know

957
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:34,559
framework that we had here in California

958
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,519
for so many years

959
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,500
um

960
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,780
were were not things that came to me

961
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,659
with strain names they were just this is

962
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:46,019
these are really good seeds from

963
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:48,598
from you know Joe up in Oregon and these

964
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:52,920
ones came from Southern humble and it

965
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:55,140
was you know Ed's favorite last year and

966
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,880
it was purple and you know a lot of them

967
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:58,440
had different scriptures and stuff and

968
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,079
of course there were varieties around

969
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,179
like train wreck and there was no such

970
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:05,220
thing as OG Kush and there was no such

971
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:06,598
thing as

972
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:08,399
um

973
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,400
you know there just wasn't very many

974
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,800
strain names and so we did have you know

975
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,079
they're a thing became popular that they

976
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,800
called Salmon Creek big bud and you know

977
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,500
it

978
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,119
it's like probably not a name that

979
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,380
people would choose these days because

980
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,660
it's like

981
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,660
you know it's so

982
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:29,699
you know it's it was a type of weed that

983
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:31,920
made big buds and it came from a place

984
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:34,078
called Salmon Creek in southern humble

985
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,519
yeah and that was that was one of the

986
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,760
most

987
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:40,380
you know sort of famous places where

988
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,320
weed came from

989
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,940
and of course I'm sure people wrote on

990
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,039
their bags a lot of the times Salmon

991
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,500
Creek big bud and then a lot of

992
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,358
helicopters went up Salmon Creek because

993
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,358
you know I would always imagine like a

994
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,400
lot of a lot of weed is you know getting

995
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:57,358
picked up going across the country with

996
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,880
that

997
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,679
you know that I wonder where this came

998
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,579
from oh it says it came from Salmon

999
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,578
Creek and it's big

1000
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,359
yeah yeah some of the first ones we

1001
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,639
worked with didn't have names and then

1002
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,759
you know we obviously had train wreck

1003
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:16,920
and we just got everything we literally

1004
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,700
that's one of the beauties of

1005
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,159
of Humboldt is that like really it's

1006
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:26,279
been such a massive hub for cannabis

1007
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:28,559
that pretty much every kind of cannabis

1008
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,380
has made its way through here

1009
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,960
um and people brought some of the first

1010
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,039
Afghani

1011
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,858
cultivars that people actually brought

1012
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:43,380
back from Afghanistan like I I have a a

1013
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:46,259
friend whose father was here in the

1014
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:49,858
early 70s and

1015
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,339
specifically went on a mission to go

1016
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:57,179
find seeds in in Afghanistan and Nepal

1017
00:42:53,338 --> 00:43:00,539
and in India and brought them back and I

1018
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:03,719
mean he could be responsible for

1019
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:06,858
you know 80 percent of modern cannabis

1020
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:09,719
just doing that one trip

1021
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:12,239
yeah and I mean that's his status dad

1022
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:13,259
will never let I begged him before like

1023
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:15,659
please

1024
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:19,800
do an interview or you know tell your

1025
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:21,179
story of of doing that and it's just you

1026
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,579
know those guys

1027
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:25,440
had their fun and they have those

1028
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,839
stories to share with people that they

1029
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,780
know and trust but they're not

1030
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:33,179
not always super excited to you know

1031
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:36,859
really you know

1032
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:40,139
I did interview Bobby ackerly of the uh

1033
00:43:36,858 --> 00:43:44,279
Brotherhood of eternal love of a few

1034
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:47,279
years ago who had gone to Kandahar and

1035
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,619
driven uh Volkswagen van full of

1036
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,019
Afghani Primo

1037
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:54,599
back across Europe and then shipped it

1038
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:57,960
to the east coast and drove it here and

1039
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:00,780
those guys also brought seeds yeah and

1040
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,358
some of the uh you know Legends of Maui

1041
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,640
Wowie ended up being like crosses

1042
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:09,179
between The Afghani and the oaxacan or

1043
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:12,779
whatever but yeah well if you still I

1044
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:15,659
mean if you go back that far

1045
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:18,740
try to make keeping the seeds out of the

1046
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:18,739
Cannabis was not

1047
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,460
everything had seeds in it except the

1048
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:28,440
Thai wheat Thai sticks

1049
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,300
yeah which that's really interesting

1050
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,099
that you brought that up

1051
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,740
um

1052
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:37,440
yep but yeah uh

1053
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:40,559
you know we figured out kind of mastered

1054
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:45,500
the whole sensimilla with seeds or

1055
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,500
cannabis without seed in Humble yeah

1056
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:53,220
I first saw it around like 79

1057
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,818
like the first California seedless it

1058
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:59,279
was like four times as much as Colombian

1059
00:44:55,818 --> 00:45:00,539
yeah instead of 500 a pound it was 2

1060
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,619
000.

1061
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:06,179
yeah but um so here's something

1062
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:08,400
interesting what about the development

1063
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:10,559
of triploids we we were talking about

1064
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,180
that a little bit right

1065
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,358
so

1066
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:16,858
triploid is is fairly high-tech seed

1067
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,420
technology

1068
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:22,858
um I mean

1069
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:25,740
technology I guess yeah it you need a

1070
00:45:22,858 --> 00:45:27,299
flow cytometer to be able to to check

1071
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:30,779
and make sure that they they are

1072
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:33,480
actually as you say they are and um

1073
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,519
so so that's pretty high tech and and

1074
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,699
they're sterile

1075
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:41,519
well they they should be sterile in

1076
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:43,379
theory they are not always sterile we're

1077
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,259
finding out but they for the most part

1078
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:49,380
if your goal is to grow

1079
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,660
seedless cannabis which obviously is the

1080
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,260
goal of most commercial people

1081
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:53,639
um

1082
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,920
then

1083
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:57,900
then yes it's a better much better

1084
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,838
option for

1085
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,579
not having to worry about that yeah

1086
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:04,259
that's also I mean there's other

1087
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:08,039
benefits as well it's supposed to

1088
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:10,619
increase the yields on average I think

1089
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,900
you know it was found to be like around

1090
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:16,318
at least 20 percent

1091
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,180
yeah so it's still you know there are

1092
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:21,019
some people that have been

1093
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:25,679
making triploids in hemp and it's still

1094
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:29,699
definitely in its sort of like infancy

1095
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,960
for especially for cannabis uh for THC

1096
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:32,098
cannabis

1097
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,679
but

1098
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:38,460
um it there are a lot of indications

1099
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:41,899
that triplets will

1100
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:44,480
potentially produce sort of superior

1101
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,680
commercially more commercially viable

1102
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,500
options than

1103
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:52,559
so then diploids and for folks that

1104
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:55,260
aware of all this it's been around for a

1105
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,900
while like you know seedless watermelons

1106
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:01,200
or triploid they're

1107
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:05,039
um bananas strawberries actually are

1108
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:09,838
octopoid a lot of the time but ploidy

1109
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:12,900
is is how many sets of chromosomes are

1110
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:14,578
in the nucleus of each cell and and

1111
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,039
that's not

1112
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:21,599
including reproductive cells which are

1113
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:22,619
usually just haploid which means one

1114
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,079
um

1115
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:26,400
single chromosome but uh

1116
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,700
that

1117
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,280
the way that you make triplets is you

1118
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:34,259
you can use uh

1119
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,480
I mean they occur in nature so they'll

1120
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:40,200
also occur naturally

1121
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:43,440
um it's a much lower uh you know you're

1122
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:45,179
it's really rare to find it but be

1123
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,220
reliable for breeding yeah it wouldn't

1124
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:50,098
be reliable and you don't

1125
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:52,799
it doesn't carry on past that unless you

1126
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:55,440
quote it so I got some out of the Squirt

1127
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,599
from last year believe it or not my

1128
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,700
friend I turned them on to some teams

1129
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,760
that's actually a different

1130
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:04,379
what you're referring to is when you see

1131
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,720
the three leaves

1132
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,460
right that the three

1133
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,939
and and what that's called is the world

1134
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:14,400
taxonomy and people often assume that

1135
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,318
that is is triploid and it's it's not

1136
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,160
it's um

1137
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:22,380
just that really common early mutation

1138
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,838
in the beginning of a plant's growth

1139
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:28,140
where it'll produce

1140
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:30,719
the three first sets of true leaves and

1141
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:33,118
then oftentimes it'll just eventually go

1142
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,179
back to normal yeah to where it's you

1143
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:39,140
like the you know parallel opposing

1144
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,139
nodes

1145
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,900
so triplet is is entirely different it's

1146
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:44,879
not something that you can observe

1147
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,160
externally at all it's something that

1148
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,019
you would have to have a flow cytometer

1149
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:51,838
to or or

1150
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:53,940
do genetic sequencing to be able to see

1151
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:57,239
it and uh

1152
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:59,400
so it's it's beyond my pay grade it's

1153
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:01,439
funny because there's popular cultivars

1154
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,380
that have been released by like

1155
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,539
well-known breeders and they didn't even

1156
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:09,119
have any idea themselves that it was

1157
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:11,940
just a naturally occurring triploid and

1158
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,800
so that was maybe part of why was their

1159
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,679
selection you know it was probably a

1160
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,780
pretty dense Fielder yeah uh they're

1161
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:20,879
like you know obviously drawn to it for

1162
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,680
a reason but you know then again it's

1163
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,079
not something you can observe with the

1164
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:27,299
naked eye

1165
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,280
we discovered that the Mach 1 is a

1166
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,280
triploid and

1167
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,079
nobody had any idea

1168
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,720
which one

1169
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,480
Mac one

1170
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:41,399
calculator stream and I I don't did

1171
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,900
Richard end up reaching out to yeah and

1172
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,300
informing him of that yeah I don't think

1173
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,800
he even knew up until uh the scientists

1174
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,220
there we work with

1175
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,839
like hey bud I happen to test this Mac

1176
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:58,039
one and then

1177
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:58,039
next thing you know turns out yeah so so

1178
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:07,200
do real triploids have also three leaves

1179
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:09,838
no no nothing it has nothing basically

1180
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:12,799
you know especially in a vegetative

1181
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:15,420
state it's there's really not any

1182
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,859
identifiable markers that you know you

1183
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,019
could tell them apart they have the

1184
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:22,078
exact same leaves you know same

1185
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:24,179
structure overall but we are starting to

1186
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,060
monitor basically just to see if they

1187
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:30,719
really do have more overall bigger and

1188
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:32,400
also of course you know yield so we

1189
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,959
produced about

1190
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,619
what are we up to like 10 different

1191
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:39,838
types of triploid varieties and we're

1192
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:42,240
testing them out right now all across

1193
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:44,219
the state actually across the country

1194
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,259
it's gonna be your first year we're

1195
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:49,078
bringing the triplets into our annual

1196
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,660
pheno hunt process which is always

1197
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:53,359
a big thing for us it's probably my

1198
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:57,058
favorite

1199
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:58,500
I want to participate in that is it you

1200
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:01,019
know it probably can be one of our first

1201
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,900
real field tests where we get to see

1202
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:06,900
them next to a population of you know

1203
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:09,960
diploid cannabis plants as well

1204
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:12,000
um I knew we we talked about this and

1205
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,019
the selection process is somewhat

1206
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,338
limited but

1207
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:20,219
how did you select males when you did

1208
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:22,558
right well yeah so as people probably

1209
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:25,618
know more and more seed companies have

1210
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,240
joined us in doing the femini seeds

1211
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:29,519
it's

1212
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:30,899
we've kind of you know we've been doing

1213
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:35,338
this for

1214
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:38,579
25 years at least so that technology

1215
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:41,039
wasn't as prevalent before and we didn't

1216
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:42,059
utilize it for the first 15 years of

1217
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,739
breeding

1218
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:46,079
and

1219
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:49,199
so we selected males

1220
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,539
in the day we we rub the stems you know

1221
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,818
when they're about this tall and I I

1222
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:55,259
still do this to be honest but when

1223
00:51:53,818 --> 00:51:56,880
they're like this tall you go out and

1224
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,180
you just like rub the stems and there's

1225
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,800
like little they're they're actually

1226
00:51:59,179 --> 00:52:04,739
trichomes that are

1227
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:07,619
having a different function and you get

1228
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:09,358
kind of the idea of the I mean you can

1229
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:11,160
absolutely tell you know one of them

1230
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,400
will just smell three times stronger

1231
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:17,118
than another exactly

1232
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,119
I thought that's what it was

1233
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:32,880
I mean just just obvious things too like

1234
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,858
you have some that are you know almost

1235
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,838
double vigorous than another one and

1236
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:39,239
that's gonna be an advantage that you

1237
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:40,799
might want to select for and you know

1238
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,779
structure it's always there's always

1239
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,460
good things to look at but it's it

1240
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:47,519
doesn't really compare quite to being

1241
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:50,039
able to look at two female plants with

1242
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:52,500
you know beautiful flower and you know

1243
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:53,940
and then you imagine the exact traits

1244
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,260
that you want to see out of that cross

1245
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,818
right away

1246
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,819
yeah yeah well

1247
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:03,379
do you get what she's saying about the

1248
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:06,000
feminized process why why it's so

1249
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,980
advantageous aside from the fact that

1250
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,260
you end up with all female seeds which

1251
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,000
kind of makes it easier for the for the

1252
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,160
grower but you want to explain it again

1253
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,739
I mean really yeah it's the fact that

1254
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:19,500
when you're breeding with uh male on

1255
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:22,019
female uh you're only getting that

1256
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:25,079
female flower visual of the female plant

1257
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:26,880
and so there's always this portion that

1258
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:30,119
is kind of a mystery you're doing your

1259
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,880
best educated guesswork there obviously

1260
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:34,800
if we look at it and make sure the

1261
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,838
structure is great you know it's nice

1262
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,420
and vigorous pest resistant whatever

1263
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:41,279
aside from those things you really don't

1264
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:45,000
know what it would look like as a female

1265
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,220
yeah so when feminized breeding came

1266
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,358
along it really it just gave us the

1267
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:53,098
opportunity to actually you know set our

1268
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:55,318
eyes on you know exactly what we're

1269
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:57,599
crossing together every single time and

1270
00:53:55,318 --> 00:54:00,719
for brand new crosses that's really

1271
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,818
important especially you know for so for

1272
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,879
people that don't understand

1273
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:07,558
how do we know exactly the female what

1274
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,858
she looks like when we're making

1275
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:13,260
feminized scenes because we're going to

1276
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:16,199
yeah because we go Fino home to it

1277
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,660
beforehand and so we have that but then

1278
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:21,358
we take that that selection that we've

1279
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:24,838
made and now we put

1280
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:27,779
silver on it and it it actually

1281
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:30,119
effectively changes it to a male now but

1282
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,220
it has the same chromosome the same DM

1283
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,318
DNA that's the plant that we looked at

1284
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:36,838
two months ago right but now we've

1285
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:40,440
turned it into a male plant and so

1286
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:44,460
therefore it makes pollen that

1287
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,139
excuse me that has the the DNA of that

1288
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:48,300
beautiful flower that we just looked at

1289
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:50,759
to three months ago or whatever I mean

1290
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:53,400
I'm kind of it takes a long time to do

1291
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,440
this [ __ ] but you could do it in three

1292
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:00,059
months in theory but it's usually harder

1293
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:03,000
anyway so we then reversed sex and now

1294
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:06,780
we've got this planet that's putting out

1295
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,880
pollen that has female all-female XX

1296
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,119
chromosomes too so that's the reason why

1297
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,539
when it lands on another female plant

1298
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:17,760
the stigma and the ovum the ovum all on

1299
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:19,800
female plants has XX chromosomes as well

1300
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,740
so you don't have this coin flip that

1301
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:26,400
you have with regular plant breeding it

1302
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:29,459
took you know I I was at UC Davis doing

1303
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,079
salmon genomics with some of my best

1304
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,599
friends there that are professors there

1305
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:36,900
and we

1306
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,880
would talk about this stuff and you know

1307
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,760
I'd just go over and over again what are

1308
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,160
the potential problems with breeding

1309
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,000
this way because I didn't want to

1310
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:49,019
jump fully into it like we have without

1311
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,960
understanding if it was going to

1312
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:53,599
negatively affect the species or if I

1313
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:58,920
was going to be doing something terrible

1314
00:55:53,599 --> 00:56:01,140
and it was just not really negative if

1315
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,059
you you could do it wrong and there can

1316
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:04,440
be negative you know you can create more

1317
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,519
hermaphrodite

1318
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:11,400
uh traits in cannabis by doing it

1319
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:14,039
incorrectly and but we learned quickly

1320
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:17,119
how to do it properly and we don't do

1321
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:21,239
that and so we don't see I mean we keep

1322
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:24,119
really really good data about any

1323
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:27,679
reports that come back from the our

1324
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:30,539
customers about hermaphrodites and the

1325
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,838
percentage of of hermaphrodites in

1326
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:37,079
regular plants is

1327
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:39,299
irregular breeding is just as high or

1328
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:42,180
sometimes even higher I mean not only

1329
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,579
that but of the feminine sorry corrupt

1330
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:46,558
but uh we do pretty extreme stress

1331
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:48,599
testing yeah on all of our breeding

1332
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,160
Chambers as well and so you know

1333
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:52,619
throughout the entire process we're

1334
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,960
almost weekly checking on the plants and

1335
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:57,000
if there's you know anyone that has a

1336
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,159
room site on it it immediately gets

1337
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,099
taken out and that way it's not going

1338
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:04,139
into production at all yeah yeah and you

1339
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:06,000
can't you can't stress test the male

1340
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:08,400
plant for hermaphrodites it's like so

1341
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,619
that's another I mean it just goes on

1342
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,559
and on the reasons that we prefer

1343
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:16,559
feminized breeding over regular breeding

1344
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:19,740
just have it ever seem to stop it's just

1345
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,540
been ridiculous how much better it is

1346
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:23,939
and it you know some people are like oh

1347
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:25,858
it's not natural and I'm just like I

1348
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,599
mean it's colloidal silver you can use

1349
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:31,679
oil silver

1350
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:33,420
like I I dropped that in mind I got

1351
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:35,219
earache and I use it I get you know like

1352
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,720
if I have a sore throat occasionally I

1353
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:38,098
use it for that and it's just like

1354
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,739
literally I

1355
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:44,160
it's not dangerous it's silver you know

1356
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:46,558
you put it in our silverware and put it

1357
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,899
in our mouths every Thanksgiving or

1358
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,700
whatever you know so in in your current

1359
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,039
market breakdown

1360
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:55,078
between

1361
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:58,679
feminized Autoflower and regular seeds

1362
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:01,079
what's the percentages there

1363
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:03,000
well you mean feminized Autoflower

1364
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:06,059
versus

1365
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,318
oh well yeah okay so you have of the

1366
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:09,059
three types of seeds you have regular

1367
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:10,619
seeds you have feminized seeds and you

1368
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:14,160
have Autoflower seeds which are also

1369
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:17,039
feminized right yeah so how does that do

1370
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,818
break down as far as what people are

1371
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,318
into

1372
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:25,079
we're like 90 people are buying 98

1373
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:26,880
feminized now for the most part and we

1374
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:29,099
still get people by the regular because

1375
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,780
they want to do breeding they want to

1376
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:33,599
you know have their first foray into

1377
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,460
breeding and and I would say you know if

1378
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,440
you're trying your first foray into

1379
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,420
breeding maybe it is easier to do

1380
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,200
regular breeding I mean it is it

1381
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:44,940
definitely is and it's easier but I mean

1382
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,759
I still would

1383
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,318
you know maybe say it's not a bad thing

1384
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,119
if you jump right into feminized

1385
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:52,798
breeding and we're always going to

1386
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,880
maintain a regular line here that you

1387
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:55,980
know we're always going to try to keep

1388
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:00,119
that around so we do do regular breeding

1389
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:03,358
we have what do we have now maybe ten

1390
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:07,380
down to 10 to 12 regular streams at this

1391
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:10,798
point uh uh-huh and like you know

1392
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,599
50 of the other so how about the new

1393
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,960
strains what what are you excited about

1394
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,960
now

1395
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,480
all of them I mean I mean

1396
00:59:18,858 --> 00:59:24,298
that's the art is gonna be really good

1397
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,699
which one here I don't know if you've

1398
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:29,039
even announced this anywhere yet but we

1399
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:30,480
just finally picked two official names

1400
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:32,818
for uh

1401
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:36,059
their Seasons drops

1402
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:37,980
the orange cream pop is coming that's

1403
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:40,559
coming up we're breeding that one right

1404
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:42,719
now I kind of wish I'd walk you over

1405
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,059
there to the field and maybe what I'll

1406
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,039
do is I I might try to send you some

1407
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:50,220
pictures I don't know if you can yeah I

1408
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,599
can edit them into the the episode do a

1409
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:53,219
little video if I walk over there

1410
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,920
without we can walk over I'll show you

1411
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:57,959
part of our orange cream pop selection

1412
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,000
and we have our jelly donut selection

1413
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,500
happening over there then we have the

1414
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,639
Clones

1415
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,739
um

1416
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:07,199
and so you know be a little window into

1417
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:09,179
how much work goes into making something

1418
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,759
but this one would be great the orange

1419
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:14,219
cream pop is

1420
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,420
three years in preparation to actually

1421
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:21,179
put it out to the public and so this is

1422
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:23,338
you know I know

1423
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:25,500
um the guys that we actually did the

1424
01:00:23,338 --> 01:00:28,318
scratch and sniff with

1425
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,719
um Burris place and one straw Farms down

1426
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:33,119
in Calaveras which if you want

1427
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:35,519
um hallel send you we're doing this

1428
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,720
massive Fino hunt this fall

1429
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:41,219
Fino frenzy was your name

1430
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,659
I think it's a fun name it's nice and

1431
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:45,959
catchy you know

1432
01:00:42,659 --> 01:00:48,838
but we're basically opening the doors

1433
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,699
for our normally it's more of a private

1434
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:53,099
group you know hunt but we're gonna

1435
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:55,739
fight some of our just industry friends

1436
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:58,200
our local colleagues and of course some

1437
01:00:55,739 --> 01:01:00,239
press folks as well I'd love to come

1438
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:02,338
we're gonna get out into these fields I

1439
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,739
think we have 10 Farms that we're going

1440
01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:07,259
to be doing it with maybe more and I'm

1441
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:10,739
losing track already but uh you know

1442
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:12,420
it's gonna be a ton of Finos and you

1443
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:14,159
know a lot of selecting to do we're all

1444
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,200
gonna have our little rating sheet with

1445
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,539
about 10 different categories that we

1446
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:20,399
try to observe and you know of course

1447
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:22,558
we're not doing this on every single

1448
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,240
plant but you know once you're walking

1449
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,400
through and you start to notice what

1450
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:28,379
really catches your eye then you know

1451
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,599
everyone kind of gets in on it and we

1452
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:33,240
always go back at the end we'll revisit

1453
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:35,700
probably like you know the lot of 20

1454
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:37,078
that somebody rated good everyone turns

1455
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:39,480
into their sheet we're like these all

1456
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,280
got you know nine through ten let's all

1457
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,699
go check these out again as a group and

1458
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,819
so yeah yeah we did this in 2018 we did

1459
01:01:44,699 --> 01:01:50,519
10 000 plants I remember I think we had

1460
01:01:47,818 --> 01:01:52,259
six seven Farms that year this year we

1461
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:53,940
haven't settled on the exact number that

1462
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:56,640
we're gonna Fino hunt it's to me it's

1463
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,200
not as much about that as it is just you

1464
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,539
know getting a broad spectrum of

1465
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:02,159
genetics I know we're gonna look through

1466
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:05,579
some of the stuff that we did with the

1467
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:07,259
Scentsy seed bank and maybe try to see

1468
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:09,720
if there's some skunk old school skunk

1469
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:11,880
genetics we can find

1470
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:14,818
um we're just gonna really open it up

1471
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,980
but also keep it tight you know our

1472
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:18,779
phenotype rating sheet is still it's

1473
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:21,539
always been available for anybody to

1474
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:23,960
download we pretty much still use a lot

1475
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:27,838
of the same variables that we did in

1476
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:31,440
2017 16 17 18 and that was kind of when

1477
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:33,119
we formalized our Fino hunting processes

1478
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,579
and uh

1479
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:38,220
yeah I feel like everybody in the world

1480
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:42,140
now is Fino hunting is such a

1481
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:42,139
a popular word to use

1482
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:52,220
it comes down to

1483
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:57,359
we're really doing it in such an

1484
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:58,558
in-depth and scaled way that uh well I

1485
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:01,199
don't think there's any way we can do it

1486
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:03,079
better yeah well ten thousand I mean in

1487
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:06,480
California hello

1488
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:09,059
and that was kind of like you know we

1489
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,719
knew that the [ __ ] was about to hit the

1490
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:15,059
fan and California was going to be a

1491
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:17,759
monster of cannabis and cannabis growing

1492
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:19,319
and and that's you know whatever it's

1493
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,400
like be careful what you ask or you

1494
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:26,099
might get it and so in that not in that

1495
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,180
feeling of that coming down the pipe I

1496
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:30,539
was like

1497
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:32,818
here we go let's freaking do it let's

1498
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:35,039
you know the good part is that we have a

1499
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:36,599
lot of different we can look at a lot of

1500
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,000
different kinds of weed

1501
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:41,160
around the state with all of our

1502
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,519
Partnerships and stuff that we have so

1503
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:48,358
let's you know make a final one out of

1504
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:50,400
this massive industry and so year one of

1505
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:51,358
California legalization we were out

1506
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,539
there

1507
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,699
you know looking through 10 000 plants

1508
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:59,039
trying to find and

1509
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:01,558
you know I mean that's been huge for us

1510
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,599
since then we've had

1511
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:07,980
even some of those varieties that first

1512
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:10,318
year still are big for us and we've

1513
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:12,780
we've refined them I mean whenever you

1514
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:15,900
find afino it's like now you found a

1515
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:19,079
clone that's the beginning of your job

1516
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:22,039
as a breeder like that is literally

1517
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:24,240
step one and it's like ridiculous

1518
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:26,759
that we're in because so many people are

1519
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:28,679
just like oh you know I gotta I found a

1520
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,720
cool clone I'm gonna you know get really

1521
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,699
they're releasing that rich and famous

1522
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,679
you know you know it's funny because

1523
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:37,500
you'll see things that get released once

1524
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:39,179
and that clone people love it and it's

1525
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,559
you know we have beautiful clone lines

1526
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:43,199
of course that we've found in this

1527
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,940
process too sure the problem is is

1528
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:46,939
sometimes when you get these things

1529
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:54,239
uh you know we'll get these genetics and

1530
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:56,040
people will you know our local friends

1531
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:58,019
and farmers will be like oh I've been

1532
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:59,579
running this lately and I've been loving

1533
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:02,280
it and maybe you guys should check it

1534
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:03,960
out try it and the problem is is you

1535
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,119
know sometimes we'll make a little Fino

1536
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,519
hunt cross just to see it and you plant

1537
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:10,680
these things and it's like there's

1538
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:13,798
genetics and things coming up out of

1539
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:15,539
these random you know basically clone

1540
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:17,519
lines that you never would have thought

1541
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:20,159
it's like you have like you know a short

1542
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:22,318
little Stumpy sativa or I mean Indica

1543
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,000
look and want a long stretchy sativa

1544
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,679
looking one that's like all across the

1545
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,960
board you're gonna see Grandma great

1546
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:30,358
grandpa smell like you know

1547
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,220
anything that you could throw in there

1548
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:34,920
it's like when you breed those clones

1549
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:37,919
that's one famous phone yeah it's like

1550
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:40,139
basically like you you actually open up

1551
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,119
what's inside of that genetic and you're

1552
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:45,118
getting this whole mess of muddled

1553
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:47,280
things more than just the one clone yeah

1554
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,920
this is like before we release something

1555
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,660
like he said with the orange cream pop

1556
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,880
it's been in the works for three years

1557
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:56,098
and that's because you know we want

1558
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:58,079
people to be able to say it's a someone

1559
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:59,700
trying to do their first time breeding

1560
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,099
or a gardener that just really likes

1561
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:04,919
stable genetics I think we all kind of

1562
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:08,700
want our stuff to smell uniform enough

1563
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:10,798
but you know we're not gonna just set

1564
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:12,960
them up with something completely random

1565
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:15,298
every time we call those Fino hotlines

1566
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,760
because that's that's what they are yeah

1567
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:20,880
well you know little kitchen Garden here

1568
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:23,579
behind us and it's it's a mess it's not

1569
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,280
our focus at all but I still want to be

1570
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:29,099
able to have a BLT in June in July and

1571
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:32,220
be like yes this is the the best time to

1572
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:34,440
have a BLT and if I planted a whole

1573
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:36,838
bunch of Brandywine Tomatoes which are

1574
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:40,380
like my favorite big juicy heirloom

1575
01:06:36,838 --> 01:06:42,119
tomatoes and instead I got one that was

1576
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:44,160
kind of like a brandy wine and I got

1577
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:46,200
cherry tomatoes and I got those weird

1578
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:48,838
ones that are meant for so sauce and I

1579
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:50,519
got these other ones you know I'd be

1580
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:53,818
pretty pissed at that Seed Company I'd

1581
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:55,259
be like damn there comes my BLT you know

1582
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:58,139
like yeah

1583
01:06:55,260 --> 01:07:01,799
don't mess with my BLT right now but how

1584
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:03,960
dare they throw in a Marzano yeah that's

1585
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:06,119
what it is yeah yeah we love those too

1586
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,460
but oh yeah

1587
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:11,640
um we may have to do another little stop

1588
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:14,699
in a minute here but um yeah

1589
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:16,858
why don't I take the show for a walk up

1590
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:18,719
over to show off some of these new

1591
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:20,298
varieties that we're working on people

1592
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,098
can get excited about them for next year

1593
01:07:20,298 --> 01:07:24,119
and uh you know I'll just do solo

1594
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:25,559
because I don't know if the internet

1595
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:28,140
really is going to reach over there

1596
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:30,180
we're actually getting some new

1597
01:07:28,139 --> 01:07:33,179
repeaters and routers so that it should

1598
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:35,279
be good up there that's cool should we

1599
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:36,538
try it then

1600
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,280
you know

1601
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:39,720
or do you want to just film and then

1602
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,819
send me films

1603
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:44,719
I I definitely can do that I can

1604
01:07:41,818 --> 01:07:48,298
definitely film and send you films so

1605
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:50,219
okay I'll keep it to like five minutes

1606
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:52,199
tops and you edit down whatever you want

1607
01:07:50,219 --> 01:07:53,879
but Hallie and I'll go walk over and

1608
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:54,598
show

1609
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:57,180
um

1610
01:07:54,599 --> 01:08:00,059
you know show what's happening okay

1611
01:07:57,179 --> 01:08:03,239
excellent all right I hope you guys

1612
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:06,180
enjoyed the podcast the Cali High

1613
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:09,598
podcast we talked about

1614
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:11,338
the the jelly donuts

1615
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:15,740
it's a new one

1616
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:15,739
these are jelly donuts

1617
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:21,359
for selection right here we've already

1618
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:22,678
selected out quite a few of them

1619
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,920
this is our

1620
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:28,619
receiver number one and then

1621
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,420
the receiver number twos and then we

1622
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:32,579
have clones

1623
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:34,500
of course would be most of the receivers

1624
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:36,778
and

1625
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:39,179
then orange cream pop was another one

1626
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,500
that we mentioned this is a block of the

1627
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:43,199
uh

1628
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:46,100
orange cream pop

1629
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,099
in development

1630
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,859
and we'll be selecting out of these

1631
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:51,858
we've already pulled some out

1632
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:59,579
moving on to hibiscus there's some

1633
01:08:57,179 --> 01:09:03,000
hibiscus here

1634
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:05,579
and what do we have here

1635
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,679
through the C4 this is a new thing that

1636
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:10,519
we haven't even

1637
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,520
named yet

1638
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:15,559
some humbled headbands

1639
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:19,279
what do we have here

1640
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:24,960
this is uh granny candy another strain

1641
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,880
we're working on we might call it

1642
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,539
berries and cream we haven't exactly

1643
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,539
decided yet

1644
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:36,738
new genetics sort of in trial

1645
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,698
good old lemongrass that's one we've had

1646
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,238
for a long time

1647
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:47,238
nice and beautiful

1648
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:53,640
and squirt

1649
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:55,920
I'm gonna redo that one this year

1650
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,480
time to make some more squirt for the

1651
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,659
world

1652
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:02,519
and more orange cream pop lots and lots

1653
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:04,139
of orange cream pop we love that one

1654
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,239
it's really good

1655
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:08,219
orange cream pop is one we're really

1656
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:10,019
excited about

1657
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:11,219
all right anyways

1658
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:12,780
um

1659
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:15,439
there's a lot more that I can show you

1660
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:15,439
but

1661
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:22,439
this is the farm here

1662
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:26,820
watering or garlic Plantation over there

1663
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:29,960
our metric Center tool center

1664
01:10:26,819 --> 01:10:29,960
it's another Greenhouse

1665
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:36,840
more seedlings coming

1666
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:39,718
nothing more important than labeling

1667
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,960
incredibly well when you're a seed

1668
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:41,960
company

1669
01:10:42,779 --> 01:10:47,340
and uh

1670
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:50,100
we're doing some projects

1671
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:52,619
looking for the very best strains for

1672
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:55,620
extraction purposes

1673
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:59,519
with a bear

1674
01:10:55,619 --> 01:11:01,859
extraction over here so we've got

1675
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,659
strands from four or five different

1676
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:08,039
breeders

1677
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:09,658
all just hunting what's the best to uh

1678
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:11,658
to do

1679
01:11:09,658 --> 01:11:11,658
um

1680
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,679

1681
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:19,460
live resin

1682
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:19,460
