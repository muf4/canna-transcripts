1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:08,460
howdy happy Friday so it's October 14th

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,339
Friday and just wanted to uh demonstrate

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,179
by the way it's about 9 00 a.m but just

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:19,460
wanted to show uh sort of the uh The

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,079
Perils of uh growing in uh Coastal

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,000
climate uh we're in the Santa Cruz

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,939
mountains we're usually fairly high

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,698
above the Marine layer uh but when we

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,058
really get socked in with fog this is

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,460
the kind of experience we get and fog

11
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:39,899
and high humidity at night and cannabis

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,539
is not always a good match we grow uh

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,100
most of our genetics are land race

14
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,159
um

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,320
and or just hybrids of just uh land race

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,979
to land race and such like for instance

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,980
this is a lamb Zam we're calling it but

18
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:59,698
this is Jamaican Lamb's bread crossed to

19
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:02,339
zamal but the point being is

20
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,920
even though we didn't get rain I don't

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,359
know I'm gonna shake this plant here and

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,978
we'll see if you can see all the water

23
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,978
on it from the fog all night

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,020
I don't know or if you come this way

25
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:21,239
gonna show you uh

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:22,859
this is uh our last Syrian plant but I

27
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,679
think you can see here too all the fall

28
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:29,099
I'm gonna shake it

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,420
but anyway so uh when we start getting

30
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:37,438
that consistent Marine layer coming in

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,240
um yeah it can the buds will sit wet so

32
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,039
this is a testament to how mold

33
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,140
resistant these plants are because we

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,820
still don't have any mold but you know

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,540
if this goes on for weeks and weeks and

36
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:51,839
weeks it can be a challenge so uh that's

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,640
why each environment is a little bit

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,060
different and then you just kind of have

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,560
to select genetics that fit your

40
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,420
environment and all the different

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,579
elements and variables of your

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,460
environment

43
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:08,519
um again so far no mold but I just

44
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,560
wanted to demonstrate because some folks

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,840
don't know anything about fog and

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,300
cannabis we're in Santa Cruz mountains

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,819
which is a beautiful thing but sometimes

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,959
we can get that Marine layer just while

49
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,060
we're here

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,300
fun to show you another plant

51
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,580
this one actually is surprisingly uh

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,080
just in the last few days I need to uh

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,360
it's getting a little yellow so I'm

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,520
gonna feed it just a little bit to kick

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,340
it through but this is a um

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,800
uh Santa Cruz Haze this is actually

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,180
original Haze right here so um and it

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,640
seems to be pretty darn happy about

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,040
things so uh but it probably won't be

60
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,159
ready till Thanksgiving or later anyway

61
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,818
you guys have a wonderful Friday

62
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,818
bye
