4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,739
today we're sitting here in our 3000

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,759
square foot Greenhouse where we do all

6
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:19,979
of our research with our different

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,439
products today I wanted to talk about

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,719
bold flow which is one of our products

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,879
made here on Cape Cod at our trout

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:31,198
hatchery the trout here are raised for

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,939
stocking ponds and with those fish we

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,739
extract the waste with a special

13
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,079
filtration system that we've designed

14
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,979
and that waste is our bold World

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,259
products this product is full of

16
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:45,839
beneficial fungi

17
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:48,899
bacteria protozoa amoebas and some

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,200
nematodes and also full diatom which is

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,198
a plankton that produces oxygen which is

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,359
a key point for our product the diatoms

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,099
not only produce oxygen in the water but

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,878
also produce oxygen at the root of the

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,939
plants they also are great uh

24
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:09,000
structures for bacteria and fungal to

25
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,199
grow on attached to it also Aggregates

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,420
your soil

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,180
when the diatoms keep reproducing in the

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,159
bottle over as much as two years which

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,500
keeps the bottle oxygenated which keeps

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,140
the product in the bottle uh aerobic

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,219
instead of anaerobic which is key to

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,500
this product

33
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,039
this product is concentrated

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,180
we recommend for just

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,460
watering for container gardening

36
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,159
for raised beds for straight in the soil

37
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:42,000
gardening whether it's vegetables house

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,759
plants or cannabis we recommend 15

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,978
milliliters which is

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,259
as simple as three capfuls of this

41
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,299
product to one gallon of water this is a

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,359
two gallon watering so we would add six

43
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,920
capsules to this watering can and then

44
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,959
water your plants that at a normal

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
watering rate until you see your soil

46
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,239
gets damp

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
um

48
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,618
and you have adequate watering do that

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,840
once a week with this product regardless

50
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,000
of the age of the plant this product is

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,800
also unique from our other products and

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,659
that we like to use this product from

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
seed all the way to harvest and I've

54
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,979
done it with multiple different plants

55
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:21,000
including this cannabis plant which is

56
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:24,060
seeded in directly in soil fed bold flow

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,939
on day number seven from seating and has

58
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,800
only been on bulb 12 up until today

59
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,900
which is uh the first day of September

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,000
and as you see it's in its budding stage

61
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,520
blooming stage so this product can be

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,818
used through all stages vegetation and

63
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,620
Bud and Bloom of of all the plants that

64
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,598
we tried it on at this point another

65
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,700
example is this pepper plant this pepper

66
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,359
plant has been getting harvested since

67
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:50,159
May 15th it's now September 1 and as you

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,540
can see it's still loaded with peppers

69
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,859
this is a lunch box or mini pepper plant

70
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:58,739
and as you can see there's plenty of

71
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,140
fruit still being produced even new buds

72
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,939
here at the top one once again this

73
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,339
plant gets watered once a week with bold

74
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,800
flow at the given rate on the back of

75
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,378
the bottle which is 15 milliliters per

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,120
gallon of water

77
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:13,620
house plants that can be used on house

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,900
plants I like to use it during

79
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,580
transplant of house plants so as I'm

80
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,800
going to transplant

81
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,080
this aloe plant and I'm going to break

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,640
away you can see the root development on

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,980
that plant

84
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,479
pretty extensive root development aloe

85
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,399
plants tend to like to be crowded a

86
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,719
little bit so as this plant gets broken

87
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,420
off

88
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:37,560
to be separated out to be transplanted

89
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:40,018
we would do really simple

90
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,719
droot wrench of this product

91
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,019
using the Bold flow so it'd be as simple

92
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,019
as

93
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,598
getting the plant wet you could leave it

94
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,479
in there for five to ten minutes pull it

95
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,060
out transplant into your potting soil

96
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,699
water once a week with the Bold flow in

97
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,299
your and within months your product your

98
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:05,759
aloe plant will look like this one here

99
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,400
this is a rosemary plant that was also

100
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,699
started from seed that was started from

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,319
seed about 28 days ago

102
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:15,959
also only use bold flow on that from

103
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,819
seed to the stage as you can see the

104
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,620
rosemary plant is thriving

105
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:20,879
another thing I like to use the bolt

106
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,459
pull for different than some of our

107
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,500
other products is I like to use it for

108
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:28,560
cloning

109
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,620
cuttings this is a tomato plant this

110
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,259
once again is as simple as

111
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,220
using 100 mils of this product

112
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,220
so that's 30

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,478
60

114
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,220
100 mils of that product

115
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,379
we'll let that sit in this water

116
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,759
out of the direct sunlight preferably

117
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,680
keeping the water temperature cooler

118
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,199
sometimes we'll put a small aerator in

119
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,478
there to keep it aerated this tomato

120
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,460
plant will start to root and be ready to

121
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,019
transplant in 10 to 11 days from today

122
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,638
so what we'll do is we'll place this

123
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,198
plant off to the side and we'll come

124
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,720
back in about 10 days and we'll we'll

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,960
see how it's developing we're just using

126
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,699
the Bold flow as a as a cloner

127
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,459
this is another thing we've used it on

128
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:21,120
this is a ginger plant where we soak the

129
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:24,239
ginger root in bold flow at a rate of

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,579
100 mils a bowl flow to 100 mils of

131
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,918
water we actually did several bulbs this

132
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,859
is just one example of one so this plant

133
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,538
was done about 32 days ago

134
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,580
you can once again see the root

135
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,918
development what I'll actually do is

136
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:41,599
I'll break this away a little bit

137
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,599
so you can actually see the ginger

138
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,939
so this is the ginger plant this is the

139
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,100
ginger root that was soaked in bold flow

140
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,978
placed in soil

141
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,580
and then later has been watered once a

142
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:58,740
week with the Bold flow products

143
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,139
and as you see it's it's a really green

144
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,960
bright green getting plenty of nutrients

145
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,180
easy uptake of any other nutrients you

146
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,038
may or may not want to use full flow is

147
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,500
also a product that you can use with

148
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,000
other nutrient products we've tested it

149
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,038
with several other nutrient products and

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,139
had good results

151
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,300
um this is a soil conditioner or a plant

152
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,939
probiotic which means it's adding your

153
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,220

products because I can use it from seed

180
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,340

181
