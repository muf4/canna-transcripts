00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:24,599
an indicia about 3 feet in height

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,519
uniform spacing and well-worked line an

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:31,359
easy grow for beginners with minimal low

a week or so into flower I did a heavy

11
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:42,839
defoliation and trim I find this to be

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,960
the best time to get your sea of green

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,600
