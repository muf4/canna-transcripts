00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
[ __ ] you passport

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,218
[Applause]

00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,219

00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,480
[Music]

5
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:21,118
hey everybody Chad Westport here and I

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:25,439
am here to give you my updated

7
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:27,359
impression of the SE 5000 light from

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,000
spider farmer

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,740
now about six months ago I did an

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
unboxing video just kind of show you how

11
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,640
to assemble it give you my immediate

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,859
Impressions but I said that I wasn't

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,320
ready to give it you know a two thumbs

14
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:43,558
up or a review at that point simply

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,878
because I hadn't used it yet and a good

16
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,399
review

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,339
you gotta use it so

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,520
I've used it and I've got two full runs

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,280
under my belt using the SE 5000 spider

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,460
farmer light and I've been pretty stoked

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,620
I mean this is top of my head this is

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,960
all in one take because I wanted my

23
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:05,640
opinions just to be natural didn't want

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,400
to use script or do anything like that

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,920
with this one uh but what can I say you

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,618
know I don't have expensive light meters

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,260
to give you precise numbers with par in

28
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:19,560
the corners and in the center I don't

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,799
have all that but I can tell you how the

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,780
plans performed for me now I also

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,780
haven't used every single light that's

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,820
out on the market this is a 480 watt

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,460
light so what I'm going to be doing is

34
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,879
comparing it to similar wattage lights

35
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,658
that I've used in the past

36
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,298
comparatively

37
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,920
I'm stoked with this one this one is a

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,380
good one

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,159
um the plants overall they were happy

40
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:49,798
you know when you've used like blurple

41
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,740
or you know like HIDs and you switched

42
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,720
lights you can almost tell that plants

43
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,759
for some reason just like seem happier

44
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,039
if that makes sense to you but you look

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,759
at your plants and you're just like

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,140
you're happy today aren't you so that's

47
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,780
something that I could tell you that I

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,879
witnessed that I saw

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,939
um even with the lights you know like

50
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:16,378
right on the canopy I didn't witness any

51
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:18,539
type of light stress or burning of the

52
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:20,878
leaves or bleaching of the colas and

53
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,878
again 480 Watts probably not going to do

54
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,299
that but still providing enough light to

55
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:30,000
get me some nice fat colas

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,340
um I didn't raise or lower it really I

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,979
kind of let things grow up into it I use

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,539
the dimmer which I'll get into here in a

59
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,818
second

60
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,400
um and that's fine the the plants didn't

61
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,659
really stretch to the light either see I

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,819
mean they're kind of growing nice and

63
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,219
compact naturally how they want to grow

64
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,738
how they're you know genetic morphology

65
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,659
is it's not stretching up it says I'm

66
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,259
getting enough right here we cool I'll

67
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:57,359
just grow slowly so that's that I did

68
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,739
mention the dimmer though just kind of a

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,019
few of the features that I liked about

70
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,700
this light that I used you know pretty

71
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,920
much all lights are dimmable these days

72
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:09,179
we got the dimmer right up here

73
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:11,158
so yeah that kicks ass use that the

74
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,080
driver too which it's on it's mounted

75
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,459
right here for me I keep it inside the

76
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,739
tent but it's something that you can

77
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,539
mount outside of the tent if you live in

78
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,060
a really hot climate or you need to keep

79
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,500
the heat down in your tent where I live

80
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,539
I'm not too worried about it and

81
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,699
actually for the winter it helps it

82
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,280
offers a little bit of heat it's not a

83
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,378
very good heater but you also don't want

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,939
it to be a heater so there is an

85
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,799
advantage to This Light it runs

86
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,199
relatively cool especially for the

87
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,140
wattage and the little trick for most

88
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,780
LEDs if you dial it down to 80 percent

89
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,639
the heat signature is half of what it

90
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,340
would be if you turn that light up to

91
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,279
100 so keep that little trick in mind

92
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,580
this light is no exception

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,439
um power cord again is long enough that

94
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,420
you can mount it outside you can raise

95
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,639
and lower it without having to move your

96
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,098
power strip I've had to do that in the

97
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,199
past if you wanted to you know from your

98
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,479
end of your flower to the beginning your

99
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,219
veg the cord's too short so now you got

100
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,378
to readjust your power strip and you got

101
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:12,120
to do everything no it's got a long

102
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:13,919
enough cord thank you for that spider

103
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,840
farmer

104
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,639
um another big advantage that I liked

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,519
over the blurpose which was my

106
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,319
introduction to the LED world there's no

107
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,139
fans there's no Motors there's no

108
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,659
humming there's no loud noise it's a

109
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,139
quiet light and you know to that it

110
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,580
effects too it's not really a power hog

111
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,579
either

112
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:38,779
um no noticeable like bump in my power

113
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:41,159
bill switching from some smaller lights

114
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:43,859
multiple smaller lights that equal the

115
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,199
same wattage uh to the one big light of

116
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,340
that wattage no no big bump there so

117
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,740
that's cool

118
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:52,198
another thing that I really like and

119
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,120
this is kind of almost common for most

120
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,639
lighting companies these days people are

121
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,259
going with the bar style lights uh after

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,400
the blurple I moved into the quantum

123
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,100
boards which is just kind of the

124
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,319
rectangle uh it doesn't cast the light

125
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,879
as evenly as the bar style does it

126
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,918
tended to create a hot spot in the

127
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,500
middle but with the bars kind of spread

128
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:13,079
out the light disperses there's airflow

129
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,319
in between I like it doesn't create

130
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,879
those hot spots as much so Booyah to

131
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,180
that

132
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,339
um also full coverage I'm in a 4x4 tent

133
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,199
okay so we got edge of the light edge of

134
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,839
the tent edge of the light edge of the

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,300
tent safe distance away not going to get

136
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,418
too hot to start a fire or nothing in

137
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,240
the tent but it covers the whole

138
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:38,879
footprint which is freaking rad no dead

139
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,418
spots maximize your space this light

140
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:45,240
perfect for a 4x4 grow tent uh

141
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:48,719
proof is in the pudding right I mean

142
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,180
here is some pictures of plants that I

143
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,840
have grown in here as you can see you

144
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,840
know nice Bud formations on this one a

145
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,339
nice chunky all the way from the top to

146
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,038
the bottom

147
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:05,399
you've got this plant here which is just

148
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:07,079
a trichome machine again all the way

149
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,620
from the top

150
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,719
down to the bottom and here's some other

151
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,199
plants that I have grown in this tent

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,400
under the SE 5000 light from spider

153
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:24,419
farmer and I tell you what no complaints

154
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:26,339
here Great Smoke grow in the fire as you

155
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:28,859
can see too you know the light it gets

156
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,779
good penetration that's something that

157
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,360
you always want to test how far into the

158
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:35,879
canopy is it going to go you don't want

159
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,580
to trim larf so you trim the bottoms up

160
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,339
well where do you stop I think I found

161
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:44,159
the sweet spot with this light and it

162
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,439
goes pretty deep so stoked on that more

163
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,280
Bud the better less trimming the better

164
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,740
too so don't grow larf everybody

165
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,719
um

166
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,180
that's top of my head

167
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,979
I think that's kind of it you know I'm

168
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,918
I'm happy with this light it's a good

169
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:04,978
light it fits the tent keeps the plants

170
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,439
happy grows me nice colas it gives me my

171
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:10,258
return after just two runs the light

172
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,779
itself has already paid for itself with

173
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:17,038
the money that I've saved from going to

174
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:20,758
the store and that weed sucks I grew the

175
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:24,300
fire here at home in my tent under the

176
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:28,139
SE 5000 spider farmer light so should

177
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,598
you everybody overgrow grow your own at

178
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,060
home lights are an important part of

179
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,459
that so if you're looking if you're

180
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,538
curious if this one has been on your

181
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,818
mind

182
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:40,259
hey I'm stoked with it I would

183
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,539
definitely use it

184
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,120
I spent money with spider Farmer in the

185
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,399
past buying their lights this one comes

186
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,319
from the factory I did not pay for that

187
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,138
I want to let you know

188
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,080
again I've did my research in the past

189
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm a Frugal guy I choose where to spend

190
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,000
my money and spider farmer is where I

191
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,418
spent it which is why they were the one

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,399
company I said yeah okay we could work

193
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,500
together on a light thing because I've

194
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,659
been approached by many they're the only

195
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,519
ones I said yes to and that's for a

196
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,740
reason so if you have any specific

197
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,418
questions hit me up in the comments if

198
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,800
you have your own experience with these

199
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:18,598
lights or maybe compared to something

200
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,819
else if you went here went there and

201
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,378
then came back let me know that's what

202
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,360
