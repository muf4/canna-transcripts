1
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,639
so i feel like this is a

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,720
a good time to highlight some of the

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,480
irrigation system going on too

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,040
yes dude so that was another part i want

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
to get to so we did this all in-house

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,839
this is all our design

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
um everything is

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,118
and we'll walk up there and i'll show

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,400
you too but we have there's there's

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,320
over 100 year old hand-dug ditches that

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,518
bring the water from the river across

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,278
the property

13
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,959
everything was set up to be flood

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,679
irrigated so there's these little

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,600
sort of outlets where the water you just

16
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,519
put a tarp down and it just flows

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
and that's how these fields were were

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,640
done and since mostly for cattle and for

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,679
grass

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,480
or hay you know that'll work but

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,000
what the problem has been is that these

22
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,439
things are over 100 years old and hand

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
dug they leak like crazy

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,718
so water being such a precious resource

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,559
out here

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,079
you got to have it you got to be able to

27
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,839
protect it and contain it and bring it

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,878
where you want it to be and not waste it

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,000
along the way

30
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,158
so we're the only farm on this

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
river system right here that have piped

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
our ditches

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,359
and so that way we've removed that

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,880
leakage and everything else and so what

35
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,200
we put is a bulge pond i'll show you

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,798
guys up here in a minute

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
that brings our water from through the

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
pipe ditches not wasting a drop

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,159
puts it in the bulge pond and then our

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,079
irrigation system

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,799
comes out from the bottom of it with a

42
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:28,079
main line heading to two brewer tanks

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,840
and then we put in main underground main

44
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,118
line and then headers that go up into

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
each one of these

46
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,478
and i can literally flip a switch and

47
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,319
water the whole garden at once

48
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:40,000
amazing so amazing and jeremy

49
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,758
how much of what you guys do at cannabis

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,200
conservancy focuses on the

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,118
water conservation it's a big part of

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
what we do water energy

53
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,640
waste it's a metric to help help the

54
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,158
farmer reduce it not only

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,159
recognize it but also reduce it we're

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,478
also here casey is one of our flagships

57
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,159
on

58
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,718
earth we're cannabis conservancy is part

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,479
of that too so not only regenerative but

60
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,640
sustainable farming and that's

61
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,759
that's really really our focus is to

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,599
helping the farmer

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,118
recognize their practices and seeing

64
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,519
where they can better save

65
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,560
water save you know reduction reduce

66
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,159
waste etc

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
so you're kind of like handing the

68
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,520
farmer a magnifying glass and saying hey

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,959
take a closer look at this component

70
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,480
let's take a look at this component

71
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,439
let's take a look at this component and

72
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,439
elevate it all

73
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,840
absolutely absolutely i like i like the

74
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,680
analogy there

75
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,200
awesome what a great concept to improve

76
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
the growth of medicine that's improving

77
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,639
the lives of so many people

78
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
this is another farm favorite this is

79
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,079
the funfetti cake you made that one

80
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,839
casey yeah this one is

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,000
farm fetty cake crasher by cookies and

82
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,759
cream

83
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
the trichome stacking on that is

84
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,318
ridiculous stacked

85
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
great nose too doughy sweet is that the

86
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:48,560
cookies and cream coming out of it i

87
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,959
think so

88
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,959
it's really

89
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,919
yeah the way it knocks out like that

90
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,000
yeah this one definitely

91
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,679
a lot of people a lot of people in the

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,719
dispensaries been like yes bring more

93
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
funfetti

94
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:09,199
this one was just recently planted um

95
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,759
each one of these houses now is going to

96
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,598
get

97
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,439
uh is in the process of getting sort of

98
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,839
a depth makeover

99
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,639
um where will force flower on these

100
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,560
houses in

101
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,158
third week of july 20th around the 20th

102
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
a problem that we've had at this

103
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,759
particular site it's a really

104
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,480
interesting microclimate

105
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,518
so we're at the bottom of a hill there

106
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,039
right on this flat

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,400
right on the river and at the bottom of

108
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,158
the hill on the other side so we have

109
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
this natural cold sink

110
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,479
and the last three years we've been

111
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,680
hammered by cold weather in fact on

112
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,479
october 25th

113
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,319
of 2020 it was 16 degrees in the garden

114
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,518
oh my goodness which is like colder than

115
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,199
anywhere else in the valley

116
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,959
in the greater valley i mean this was

117
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,560
this was insanely cold

118
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,560
and we had a tremendous amount of loss

119
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,318
so we feel if like if we can

120
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
depth these out being that we have the

121
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,958
infrastructure let's get in

122
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
before the frost even has a chance to

123
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,479
mess us up

124
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,239
yeah head start man jump that what three

125
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,280
to four weeks on the natural flowering

126
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
exactly

127
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,438
okay i really like that you can kind of

128
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,359
see in the

129
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,199
you know fresh planting a little bit

130
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,439
more of the layers yeah

131
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,478
so we've got the wood chips we've got

132
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,879
our compost

133
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,918
we've added some earthworm castings on

134
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,399
top but

135
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,039
underneath is just the native soil and

136
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,638
we

137
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,040
we're saying it's just a native soil but

138
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,519
it's so much more given the years

139
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,360
yep of sheet mulching and like bringing

140
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,959
it back so it's

141
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,879
this is the essence of regenerative

142
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,439
agriculture you take semi

143
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,199
dead soil from years and years of solar

144
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,839
abuse and whatnot and

145
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,160
overgrazing over you know over ag

146
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,439
practices that didn't necessarily

147
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,520
jive with with a a regenerative

148
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,279
format you know that of just heavy

149
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,719
watering this particular

150
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,799
piece of property was one of the

151
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,000
original homesteads in this little

152
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
applegate valley

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,199
and it hadn't been farmed in 50 years

154
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,120
when we got it there was just a

155
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,520
tremendous amount of grass

156
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
kind of overgrown and maybe even a

157
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,478
little bit of marshyness

158
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
from sort of the leaky ditches and

159
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,240
everything else and

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
we just sort of set to work on it laying

161
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,918
down mulch

162
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,478
and and getting it better and then every

163
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,439
year

164
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:25,839
we get more productivity out of the

165
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,839
plants and out of the garden

166
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:34,319
[Music]

167
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,319
you
