1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:05,278
what up hope everyone's having a good uh

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,318
Friday just figured I'd give a little

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,320
garden update uh

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:13,259
I'm gonna flip this next week

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,298
right around the 10th or so

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,829
so I gotta get in here

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,618
clean up the lowers take phones

8
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:22,320
[Music]

9
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:25,679
went back to one layer of trellis

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,939
uh I just did bamboo last time

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,079
so

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,960
just trying to figure out the best

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,058
system for these big pots

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
I think last time I ran three to four

15
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,439
plants this time we're doing two plants

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,899
just in a row

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,759
kind of imitating

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,759
outdoor production just giving them as

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,899
much root space as they want and we're

20
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,719
just feeding

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,520
plain water and the drip tape

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,140
I think it comes on two hours every two

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,000
days

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,039
it's moist so they practically grow

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
themselves

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,579
the system yeah

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,140
I wish I would have been here from the

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,539
get-go but you know sometimes you gotta

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,338
take the long route but uh

30
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,140
yeah

31
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,000
you know I threw some hay downs we got

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,859
grass growing which was no problem I

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,280
just trim that back and throw another

34
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:16,140
layer of the straw or local hay so it's

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,019
non-squay it's just from

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,000
from Friends faster but uh so you do get

37
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,739
weed seed but I'm not too worried about

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,659
it

39
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,399
um but yeah as you can see

40
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,960
just been uh the reason I threw the

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,340
trellis on was because

42
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,618
the plants were kind of getting big and

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,240
it's nice to uh just to train them down

44
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,578
you know so you have an even canopy

45
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,618
multiple tops everything got topped

46
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,478
twice and then it's just kind of been

47
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,180
you know bending

48
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:45,859
and uh keeping them somewhat even

49
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,860
especially these taller plants

50
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:49,640
it's a little smaller funeral hunt than

51
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,938
I would typically do

52
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,939
[Music]

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,259
only

54
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,540
20 plants probably

55
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,978
each run some of them have taken you

56
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,680
know going back through like my mango

57
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,959
tree the Jaffe

58
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,179
um usually what I like to do is I'll do

59
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,000
kind of like uh you know just to take a

60
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,280
peek and kind of see and then if it's

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,939
something that I really like then we'll

62
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,098
uh grow out a larger population

63
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,780
so like this you know I've got my mango

64
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:25,139
tree up here

65
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,140
in the front right and then our Jaffe

66
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:31,079
which is a seba by comertonic Z

67
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:34,799
I've got high alpines lemon cookie dough

68
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,560
and then his uh sour on his pineapple

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,140
sugar cookies just likes to grow some

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,620
some length to her and then uh over here

71
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:46,018
we've got Bubba G which is a CBG variety

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,340
from Swiss cannabino way

73
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,620
figured out what's going on with this

74
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,500
pot I think it's just you know getting a

75
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,360
little too uh over watered but I didn't

76
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,459
check it out I'm trying to figure it out

77
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,099
I'm gonna try and train that big old

78
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,659
Bush over and kind of fill in the Gap

79
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:05,459
and then we've got his uh

80
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:07,439
so this is uh I'm excited for this

81
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,000
greenhouse

82
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,699
I'm down

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,780
probably uh

84
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,780
beginning of October

85
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,378
[Music]

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,480
still got that men's monster tobacco

87
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,399
plant it's growing out harvested a

88
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,199
couple leaves right now she's just a

89
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,219
catch for uh

90
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,219
fungus gnats

91
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,480
there you have it I mean it's pretty uh

92
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:39,479
pretty simple system I we uh we did

93
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,098
Columns of biolive

94
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,000
and uh

95
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:46,859
so far so far that's all the

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,199
amendments we've added you know I'm just

97
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,739
grown in recycled soil that's probably a

98
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:55,878
couple years to five six years old

99
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,878
and uh

100
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,679
yeah they're loving loving life

101
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,378
um I think I've only foiler sprayed once

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,939
just uh a little bit of grasshopper

103
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,798
damage

104
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,919
um

105
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,560
and I you know I use uh

106
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,179
pretty minimal boiler sprays to try and

107
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,238
keep it the cheapest possible but we do

108
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,519
uh like stuff oil X which is just like a

109
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,879
mineral oil and then I like the

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,459
potassium fatty salts

111
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:30,379
relatively cheap just like Horticultural

112
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,379
soap and then

113
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:34,620
I like sulfur you know the micronized

114
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,120
sulfur usually will do that with maybe

115
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,120
once in veg

116
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,740
and then diatomaceous earth you know if

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
you had a couple uh

118
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,579
you can add a little bit of that to your

119
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,319
spray just to gives like a lightly

120
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:48,478
coating you know I don't like to do that

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,459
too close to a flowering so typically

122
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,918
I'll do one more spray and just kind of

123
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,739
rinse them off

124
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:59,399
after this maybe with a zero tall or

125
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,720
like a isopropyl alcohol just to kind of

126
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,719
clean them and do a light

127
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:06,198
pesticide spray

128
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:10,279
yeah here you have it
