29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,480

36
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,159
ourselves the fun thing about royal

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
grand radio is we don't always know our

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,159
guests sometimes we do but we really

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,920
like to dig into the past

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,840
we don't know each other we've talked on

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
the phone a little bit to kind of get a

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
little bit of a primer to come in

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,118
together

44
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,118
tell us all about how we ended up here

45
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,879
today what started you on the path

46
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,640
towards cannabis and humboldt and

47
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,118
how'd we get here

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,799
oh wow that's a that's a pretty big one

49
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,478
there but

50
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,118
for me i could say it's kind of like the

51
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,478
water you know like

52
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:49,920
i was raised in southern california

53
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:52,799
but it was around uh pools

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,040
and as the water dried up in the drought

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,200
long time ago the pools were empty and

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,200
we skateboarded in them and it's like

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
the early early years my friends were

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,680
actually

59
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:06,639
legitimately jay adams jim muir

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,239
dogtown tony alva and i still can't keep

61
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,039
in contact with several of them and

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,159
poor jay passed away legend z flex

63
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,479
anyway

64
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,159
so skateboarding skateboarding led to

65
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,959
surfing surfing led into radical

66
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,878
radical was we were doing radical things

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,039
um when all the

68
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,318
kind of jocks in school were

69
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,959
getting drunk

70
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,799
we were sneaking off behind the back and

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,360
finding our old my older brother's weed

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,719
stash and smoking weed

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,040
skating pools and trying to get air and

74
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,560
surfing led to snowboarding

75
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,479
um

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
probably is

77
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,560
way back

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,120
14 or something years old

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,039
you know some of those seeds i had

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
we put into the hills

81
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,280
you know and planted them and uh

82
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,719
yeah like we were talking about some

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,919
friend earlier

84
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,759
uh

85
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,318
you know those were funny plants you

86
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,439
know barely got buds dried up in the

87
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,479
oven

88
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,759
um and then later on it became like

89
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,079
surfing

90
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,719
surfing evolved around a lot of chill

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,519
time chill time was smoking weed so like

92
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,280
for me i grew up fortunately

93
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,759
where i had like this really good weed

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,239
all the time so i had

95
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,000
a lot of it became like the original og

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,319
as i got a little bit older

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,199
and uh with snowboarding

98
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,958
and i was uh friends with the guys that

99
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,839
had the original

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,759
og in san fernando valley and

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,598
our friend teddy as an example he used

102
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,199
to make these cookies and everyone say

103
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,598
oh you got to hello you got teddy's

104
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:47,280
cookies like don't even take more than a

105
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,878
quarter don't even take a quarter

106
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,360
this is long before the days of

107
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,438
pre-measured dosages measure doses so

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,439
then uh

109
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,120
anyway i had uh

110
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,318
skipped through some other things i had

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,560
a i was a surfboard i made skateboards

112

so i made surfboards it brought out the

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,360
weed brought out a lot of creative

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,479
things and i

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,439

116
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,399
different medication medicines i've

117
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,560

um

120
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
but through natural medicines if i

121
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,879
started to see things quite a bit

122
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,519
different and i i had a brand called ig

123

and i had all these different ideas and

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,079
then i opened a store when i was uh 20

135
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,959

in a property with generators for a year

172
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,239
maybe two seasons

173
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,720
but right after that i was like i gotta

174
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,400
get a property with really good

175
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
environmental

176
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,318
thoughts uh lock the gate live in the

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,800
trees

178
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,720
have my own spring

179
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
it was until later with compliance that

180
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,479
i put the well in because i had so much

181
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,079
water i didn't know what to do with it

182
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,439
all and the other time i have to put a

183
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,359
well in

184
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,600
but i live in the trees and lock the

185
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,240
gate and have a great life and not

186
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,720
you know deal with the whole society of

187
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,960
the internet and the computer and the

188
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,080
emails so it's kind of ironic it's come

189
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,959
all the way around now with legality and

190
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,959
compliance

191
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,120
so the first property i got was

192
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,319
basically with uh

193
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,560
under the 215 where i i read the law and

194
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,160
it said you couldn't cultivate unless

195
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
you were a

196
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,400
dispensary cultivating yourself so i had

197
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,598
a friends with some of the dispensary

198
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,598
so we actually went in escrow together

199
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,680
purchased the property and then so it

200
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,439
was basically their property and my

201
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,959
property and then i was the guy that

202
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,879
would provide the

203
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,959
cannabis for their thing and i basically

204
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,000
never got paid my whole time grew a

205
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,038
whole bunch of years never got paid

206
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
that was

207
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,399
so common we all just worked we just

208
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,879
grew it because we were growing you know

209
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,719
it was like growing

210
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,800
and it's because 215 was pretty much

211
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,240
like a donation you were growing for the

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,680
patients you know we had a lot of

213
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,199
patients

214
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,038
we and i started just putting in

215
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,598
greenhouses and greenhouse i was really

216
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:40,079
into the greenhouses i wanted to have

217
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,038
sun grown but with the controls of the

218
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,279
environment in the off seasons sure put

219
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,878
a little heat in the spring put a little

220
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,959
d hums in the fall

221
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,439
protect against those september rains

222
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,560
right so i did some full term

223
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,560
you know runs um but mostly

224
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,839
was into the greenhouse thing

225
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,240
and then as it went into like compliancy

226
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,439
and all that i was always breeding seeds

227
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,680
and

228
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,399
and uh doing the

229
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,560
different uh you know upgrades to try to

230
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,878
make everything have a single twisty

231
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,879
tire zip tire piece of plastic on my

232
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,120
entire property probably

233
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,280
40 acres of pristine

234
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,000
redwoods and trees and you know the

235
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,478
county kind of liked it in the beginning

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,240
and then after going along for a while

237
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,680
paying all the fees they were like no we

238
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,800
don't like that the road's not good

239
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
enough

240
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,320
yeah so

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,320
that was a tough one on that one

242
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,560
and then i got into growing in the

243
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,479
farmlands

244
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,399
uh more in the flat

245
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,440
uh like holmes flat

246
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,120
and i learned about dry farming and

247
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,120
i was doing kind of a modified dry

248
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,720
farming for a while

249
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,839
yeah that's a fascinating area i went

250
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,480
down there

251
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,040
a few years ago probably meeting some of

252
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,959
your neighbors i would imagine

253
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,639
and i learned a little bit about

254
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,039
you know the magic of that area and how

255
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,360
the the eel river kind of swiggles

256
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,838
through those those mountainsides

257
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,480
and and creates this this amazing

258
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,640
farming possibility that i really wasn't

259
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320
very familiar with since then i've you

260
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,159
know later learned that there's some

261
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,800
vineyards doing that down south i think

262
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,679
paso robles area there's a few

263
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,958
um

264
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,239
you know the whole technique just

265
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,759
fascinated the hell out of me i really

266
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,560
couldn't believe it it looked so amazing

267
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,639
and it was so thriving not just cannabis

268
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,319
they had food everywhere and herbs and

269
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,199
butterflies and bees and the whole place

270
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,440
was just

271
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,560
it really was just as magical as it

272
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
could get

273
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,079
um

274
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,200
yeah so i've always been fascinated to

275
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,120
go down there and kind of learn more

276
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,959
about how the plants can sustain

277
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,919
themselves over the course of their

278
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,039
cycle

279
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,559
you know

280
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,679
with that concept

281
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,239
so yeah it's amazing yeah dry farming

282
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,439
quickly got on to dry farming but uh

283
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,680
talk about a lot of different things

284
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,360
today if we'd like to but uh yeah with

285
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,679
the dry farming it was it was pretty

286
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,519
neat with me because i was like okay i

287
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,159
had done some indoor but i originally

288
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,159
grew outdoor you know when i was a child

289
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,958
you know like trying you're just like

290
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
fun

291
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,479
couple plants

292
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,200
saw and i've always had gardens and

293
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,480
fruit trees and all this stuff so

294
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,720
then the indoor and then the indoor

295
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,440
you're like okay i i don't really feel

296
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
good

297
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,519
then the greenhouses became like okay

298
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,839
the greenhouses are cool and i was doing

299
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,320
greenhouses with lights and power

300
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,320
no generators but then i when i i bought

301
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,200
a property in holmes

302
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,879
uh

303
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,640
strictly because of that's the way the

304
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,399
ordinance was going and i thought okay

305
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,078
this would be great be on the fly so but

306
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,759
then there i was doing

307
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,919
light depth

308
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,078
with no lights so just timing it

309
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,559
effectively planning at the right time

310
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,399
and then no fans no power but i had

311
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,799
power so i was trying to do it more

312
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,799
sustainable and i planted in the ground

313
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,240
but at the time i didn't know

314
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,679
anything about dry farming and i

315
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,639
actually bought the property there not

316
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,399
even knowing about dry farming and

317
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,838
it was sunshine johnson who you know

318
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,440
told me yeah we're doing this dry

319
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,880
farming thing and

320
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,480
i thought you should try it and i was

321
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,360
like try really really not going to

322
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,360
water yeah dig down there there's some

323
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,639
moisture in the soil and i was like okay

324
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,879
and then

325
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,039
so i i did like

326
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,759
10 000 square feet was what the license

327
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,759
was going to be for and uh

328
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,720
i did 10 000 square feet of greenhouse

329
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,278
hoop you know depth like 20 by 100s and

330
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,600
then i did a separate area that was my r

331
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,200
d testing area and that was dry farmed

332
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,600
like completely and

333
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,120
the plants that i fussed with and

334
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,040
pruned and

335
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,120
i had the hoses there as an emergency

336
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,799
and i watered the holes in the beginning

337
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,600
and some of the neighbors had done that

338
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,359
too not everybody's pure in that area

339
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
sure but

340
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,959
you know it's moved closer towards it

341
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,278
now and uh

342
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,518
i had the hoses out and that's to lead

343
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,039
into that so anyway the dry farm plants

344
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,000
did better

345
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,319
they got better buds they got bigger

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,958
they were they're more dense even more

347
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,800
dense and the plants i had watered and

348
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,439
foliar sprayed and

349
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,679
fussed with and stuff picked leaves and

350
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,639
stuff and pruned them

351
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,638
those

352
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,320
didn't get as good it was like amazing

353
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,959
so then we're just like what the hell so

354
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,040
then i transitioned into more

355
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,679
uh getting closer i did a back feel i

356
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,439
moved triple r there and i grew like a

357
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,278
bigger area

358
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,200
and i had it like okay

359
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:29,120
we'll kind of try that and then uh

360
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,519
what came full circle was uh the

361
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,039
person i gave my first like seeds out to

362
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,120
was uh

363
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,879
uh out in shively

364
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,879
organic medicinals and they were more

365
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,958
the purists they were the

366
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,439
they had an organic food farm they still

367
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,479
do new moon organics so they farm all

368
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,279
kinds of fruits and vegetables and

369
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,200
squashes and figs and

370
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,799
nuts and they do rotation of crops

371
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,480
and then they were growing a smaller

372
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,399
plot of cannabis

373
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,560
versus i had a smaller property with a

374
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,399
big plot of cannabis

375
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,679
and i was really intrigued by how they

376
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,440
could

377
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,519
just leave the plants

378
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,519
natural and

379
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,919
their technique though was true dry

380
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,720
farming you know that's the whole story

381
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,879
we could go into itself but uh

382
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,800
so when i went back over to homes every

383
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,320
day i was like man i got even my hill

384
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,479
spotted well i got to get rid of this

385
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,800
hill spot the county's probably right

386
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,720
like we should just get out of the hills

387
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,958
we should be down on the fields and the

388
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,720
flats we should be in the perfect place

389
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,119
and then even my home place it doesn't

390
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,200
really work for me because it's it's a

391
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,039
pretty good place but it's like this

392
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,240
place in shively is like this like the

393
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,000
best place

394
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,278
and i pretty much decide i'll sell all

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,039
my stuff

396
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,879
and just sell i'm over it i'm over it

397
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,799
the prices were going down it was two

398
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,720
getting too complicated

399
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,479
and i sold everything and then

400
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,920
after i sold everything liquid

401
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,120
everything then

402
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,759
uh jane and organic medicinals said why

403
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,759
don't you come over and farm here

404
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,639
and i was like well what do you mean

405
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,480
like

406
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,639
so well you know you could get a license

407
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,639
and you could lease a place and

408
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,560
so i started uh

409
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,320
kind of just helping out and

410
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,638
had a bunch of

411
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,959
past due invoices to try to collect from

412
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,759
the first years of track and trace i was

413
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,838
100 in on the track and trace and

414
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,919
everything and it was like

415
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,320
25 hours a week and

416
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,078
no one was paying nobody was paying like

417
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,920
all the distributors were basically the

418
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,239
middlemen you know they were hustling

419
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,120
the hell out of us yeah yeah so i had

420
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,039
all these people weren't paying me and

421
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
and i decided to kind of take a break

422
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,319
and just like

423
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,079
and i ended up coming back then into

424
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,040
shively

425
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,278
and leasing a place out on their farm

426
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,519
and then i grow alongside them because

427
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,120
we have similar views and they have the

428
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,679
real pure views

429
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,078
don't get me wrong they're the purest of

430
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,599
the best of the dry farmers

431
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,278
and even over there in holmes it doesn't

432
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,000
compare homes has like seven feet of

433
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,480
topsoil larabee has about three shively

434
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,480
has like 30 feet of topsoil wow and

435
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,519
shively is such a diverse

436
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,240
like mini

437
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,679
uh biosphere almost where the

438
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,680
all the neighbors have kept really

439
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,599
strong to the organics over the years

440
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,599
and each other farm

441
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,759
you know the scentsy bolt down the

442
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,440
street humble flowers and a few others

443
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,198
that are there have kept strict on their

444
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,120
organic ccof

445
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,639
certification so we don't even have to

446
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720
do pest control

447
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,639
nature takes its course like it's a kind

448
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,480
of a wait and see approach

449
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,198
yeah where in the past you'd see an

450
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
aphid and you'd be like oh my god aphids

451
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,159
now you like look at them and you're

452
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,920
like okay what are they doing and

453
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,519
they're like they're still there three

454
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,399
or four days like dude they're still

455
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,560
there and then on day six you're like

456
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,320
someone's coming in and eating them

457
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,000
millions of ladybugs and then they start

458
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,800
breeding and often you're like whoa i

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
have more ladybugs we've ever seen here

460
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,479
so it's really neat out there that's

461
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,120
really cool i didn't know that about the

462
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
top soil layering and

463
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,839
you know

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,159
these properties these places that we're

465
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,279
talking about are down along the eel

466
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,120
river

467
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,439
along the banks of the eo river that had

468
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,919
crazy historic flooding

469
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,680
for eons before but all the way up into

470
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,240
the 60s

471
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,679
um before they put the dam in

472
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,959
right you know like 53 and like 64 or 54

473
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,120
and 64.

474
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,879
64 was the big one it's no damn it's

475
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,639
what happens is the eel river it goes

476
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,559
out through ferndale

477
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,799
and a series of big wide bridges and

478
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,799
then it goes out into the alluvial fan

479
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,519
out in the ocean out there

480
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,639
and

481
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,799
there was a really big tides king tides

482
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,680
a really big swell so the surge of the

483
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:45,599
swell and then the moon cycle

484
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,559
was a full moon so as the storm hit real

485
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,879
big

486
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,518
and the water hit you know something

487
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,799
like 70 inches of rain over like a week

488
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,919
or something

489
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,000
and um

490
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,399
the water had nowhere to go because the

491
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,240
ti so it just filled up and then in that

492
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,159
eel river valley

493
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,240
and that's really the appellate as you

494
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,159
know you could have them organic minutes

495
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,318
dry farmed organic venisons

496
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,919
come back on and talk about the

497
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,078
forming an appellate there and that's

498
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,880
the appellate the eel river valley

499
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,198
uh basically from like high rock just

500
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,799
north of like the honeydew exit

501
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,919
founders grove

502
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,519
um

503
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,199
in through

504
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,720
uh up to like stafford so it would

505
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,919
include like

506
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,120
larabee

507
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,559
holmes

508
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,798
shively

509
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,399
pepperwood and stafford that's kind of

510
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,319
the flood plain

511
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,038
area and the river backed up there and

512
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,079
made then deposited all the forest

513
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,079
matter

514
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,599
so all that organic forest matter from

515
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,279
the logging and the building of the

516
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,199
freeways

517
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,879
washed the complete towns out but it

518
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,840
basically washed off the mountains and

519
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,280
then

520
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,759
the finer

521
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,359
forest matter settled into that

522
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,919
eel river valley there yeah and i've

523
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,279
read some history on it too that it had

524
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,440
snowed

525
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,960
really low leading into that so there

526
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,480
was a lot of snow on the mountains and

527
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,079
then that storm came through so it

528
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,880
melted all the snow

529
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,879
and logging was you know really ramping

530
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,919
up in that area then and so

531
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,480
lost a giant hillside or two

532
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,440
full of trees and stumps and oh

533
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,558
everywhere just giant hillsides down

534
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,720
into the river so like eons

535
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,918
worth of this ancient redwood fur forest

536
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,440
soil

537
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,520
just piled up and got deposited in that

538
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,840
area of the eel

539
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,879
that's really just super fascinating to

540
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,759
me

541
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,600
and

542
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,440
you know having not had any experience

543
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,678
personally with dry farming it's super

544
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,080
fascinating also i actually was speaking

545
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,000
with sunshine just the other day

546
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,678
on uh kmud

547
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,679
we had a really good conversation and

548
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,440
she was you know kind of shedding some

549
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,960
light on some of that stuff and talking

550
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,038
about water conservation and the

551
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
droughts and you know i was coming at it

552
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,720
from a very different perspective that's

553
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,080
another thing you and i were talking

554
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,200
about earlier

555
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,199
is

556
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,798
i've grown in a lot of different ways

557
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,000
but i've never done the dry farming but

558
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,720
i have indoor outdoor

559
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,880
you know all different styles of indoor

560
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,160
all different styles of outdoor

561
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,520
automated organic salts

562
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,440
hand water

563
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,400
to get a really huge

564
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,480
feel for everything and you know

565
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
a lot of those folks out there you guys

566
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,480
have been like

567
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,400
steadfast focused

568
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,400
on developing these techniques and

569
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,559
really improving this whole permaculture

570
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,880
thing and that really speaks to me

571
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,639
so much we've been touching a lot more

572
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,480
on regenerative farming and that sort of

573
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,919
stuff on the podcast

574
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,720
you know even though rick and i work for

575
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,880
royal gold and we sell soil and we

576
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,960
endorse however you want to grow grow in

577
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,960
your pots grow in small pots grow in big

578
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,400
pots you know bring the medicine to the

579
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,240
people

580
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,000
but i'm just super fascinated by this

581
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,160
dry farming concept yeah we both come

582
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,960
from a pretty long extensive background

583
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
in

584
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
you know caring for the earth trying to

585
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,640
trying to be the best humans we can be

586
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,640
and that definitely leads you know

587
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,120
pretty deeply into how our food is

588
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,120
produced and oh yeah and uh and how we

589
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,000
you know we use this land and live off

590
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,079
this land as as gently as we can

591
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,359
especially you know having kids

592
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:21,599
you know it's it's up to us to kind of

593
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,000
guide our little slice of the future

594
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,439
into the right path you know and a big

595
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,440
part of that is

596
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,679
to me is recognizing

597
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,279
the influencers the elders the people

598
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,280
that came before us and developed this

599
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,519
stuff and you know the culture that

600
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,879
created these concepts so

601
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,119
you know i think it's really awesome

602
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,120
that you came out of this surf skate

603
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,879
community we we've

604
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,719
focused a little bit on this community

605
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,039
and how integral it is to cannabis and

606
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,400
bringing cannabis to people and kind of

607
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,158
opening people's eyes

608
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
how did all of these

609
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,120
you know kind of convergent paths start

610
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,000
to focus your energy more on breeding

611
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,918
because

612
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,279
you know i know you're farming on all

613
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,440
sorts of different ways but really you

614
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,279
were saying earlier your focus is more

615
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,600
now on the breeding again

616
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,720
what what brought you back to that

617
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,119
passion

618
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,839
okay probably like

619
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,359
six or so years ago it got to the point

620
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,319
where it was like

621
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,240
as the 215 was growing the stores wanted

622
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,639
you to double up and double up and

623
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,720
double up and then as the

624
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,080
the engineers were sending you these

625
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,480
giant bills as you're going into the

626
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,879
the new 64 legalization you were like

627
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,960
okay double up double up and then you're

628
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,280
like okay sign on the dotted line you

629
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,558
know you're gonna have all this square

630
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,519
footage

631
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:41,200
um

632
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:45,119
so i had a pretty good

633
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,519
footprint that i had signed on under 64

634
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,279
you know under the new licensing

635
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,599
early out of the gate

636
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,960
and it became like okay

637
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,119
so the amount of time i was spending

638
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,720
cultivating

639
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,798
the amount of time i used to spend on

640
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,200
the breeding all of a sudden went into

641
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,960
this i was spending track and trace we

642
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,159
were in the early version of the track

643
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,038
and trace

644
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,720
where

645
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,200
you had these little tiny stickers that

646
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,038
would rip off the zeros and

647
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,120
a a

648
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,359
o and a zero is like the same and the

649
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,639
twos look like the fives

650
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,719
and you're like

651
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,120
oh my god i can't barely even see this

652
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,519
stuff and anyway so what happened is i

653
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,479
started to go like okay i cannot just

654
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,319
keep doing this whole like depth scene

655
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,759
pulling tarps we had like a strict

656
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,639
schedule

657
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,640
703 707

658
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,600
7-eleven you know four minutes apart

659
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,600
drive the motorcycle up the hill

660
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,519
ten minutes apart get that one every

661
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,519
night every night every night boom every

662
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,119
morning open them and then blowers on

663
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,359
them and the whole thing and

664
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,839
we produced some really quality weed and

665
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,678
it was you know i i got some

666
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,000
high recognitions from even like the

667
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,000
early just like sun growers guild as

668
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,119
farm of the year and highest terpenes

669
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,038
and

670
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,759
got like three out of five of the awards

671
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,119
the first year year and similar the

672
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,200
second year anyway

673
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:08,479
so i i started to go like i need to get

674
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,640
back to the breeding because like

675
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,759
i had been fortunate enough to back in

676
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,520
the day

677
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,839
uh have the connection on the original

678
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,319
ogs which then i was able to

679
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,240
have those get up here in the humboldt

680
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:24,480
and then those became

681
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:27,359
like the sfv and tkog basically got bred

682
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,279
together and became like the humble og

683
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,158
and then the lario g kind of popped out

684
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,319
of that

685
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,440
same time and then

686
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,240
so when i

687
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,880
uh started having some friends come up

688
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,519
you know that had distribution outlets

689
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,600
san francisco area they had the

690
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,000
my good friend was uh you know lived a

691
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,240
couple houses away from mario guzman so

692
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,759
mario was mr scherbinski you know so

693
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,759
scherbinski

694
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,319
was like hey i got these cuts you know

695
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,319
i'll get you the original cookies i have

696
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,720
sunset sherbert and then i got this new

697
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,158
one we're calling it gelato

698
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,120
gelato he's like which one do you think

699
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,440
you got

700
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,839
gelato 41 or whatever it was the one i

701
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,759
had and i was like the sixth farm or

702
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,439
something to that matter

703
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,839
that sherbinski and we were gonna be

704
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,000
called like the sherbet tribe and

705
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,079
have this medallions and all this funny

706
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,038
stuff that his manager was doing was a

707
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,278
good guy

708
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,278
jay lofty back in the day

709
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,720
and uh

710
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,880
so

711
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,400
anyway fast forward is i basically had

712
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,400
an agreement that i wouldn't breed with

713
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,679
any of those or do anything but i had

714
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,240
these

715
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,679
really good og seeds which eventually i

716
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,240
crossed

717
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,240
to into the gelatos and the sherbets and

718
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,079
the cookies and then also was like

719
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,839
accumulating other

720
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,519
gear from people that i knew or had and

721
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,959
so when track and trace came about i had

722
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:51,679
about a hundred and like 19 or 117

723
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,200
strains on the track and trace list

724
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,120
they're just like

725
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,519
what though and i was literally tracking

726
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,359
every one and i didn't fake it at all i

727
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,599
had like yeah i've got this one so i

728
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,119
started pheno hunting like major amounts

729
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,000
i would be like okay well i'm putting

730
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,678
500 plants and a 20 by 100

731
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,480
or even more sometimes and i'd be like

732
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,120
okay so that's all different seeds

733
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,319
that's going to be 500 of that cross 500

734
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,519
of that cross so i was doing like five

735
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,759
to six hundred

736
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,599
i started doing a couple like thousand

737
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,038
plant hunts and then people were like

738
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:22,319
what are you doing i said dude i'm

739
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,440
honestly

740
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,918
tired

741
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,840
of like having to grow the weed harvest

742
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,759
the weed and then just have it go into a

743
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,839
bag and put a sticker on it so it can go

744
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,440
into some metric system i'd rather just

745
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,119
work on the genetics

746
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,720
work on the strains

747
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,158
work on what really people are looking

748
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,000
at because no one was looking at

749
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,240
terpenes so much and i was seeing this

750
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,798
correlation between like certain

751
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,798
terpenes if they hit like point four

752
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,200
certain ones that hit point two

753
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,519
it'd be half of that two to one some of

754
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,080
them were four to one so like cbd thc i

755
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,960
was seeing correlations between

756
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:59,359
you know merisine

757
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,120
uh humelin you know different ones

758
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,719
linalool and you know sometimes my

759
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,479
pronunciation is different than certain

760
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,120
people on something

761
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,519
i get mixed up with violence

762
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,439
yeah anyway so uh i've seen these

763
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,639
correlations and i was trying to like

764
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,159
devol uh divest my brain or whatever the

765
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,679
word is into like understanding all

766
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,039
these so then all of a sudden i had like

767
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,320
so many and everyone's like how are you

768
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,079
doing that i said well i had a

769
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,759
background where i worked with numbers

770
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,639
shaping surfboards

771
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,400
so on a surfboard it's like a curve

772
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,240
that's an infinite amount of numbers

773
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,519
because you're only measuring every 12

774
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,679
or 24 inches down a 6 7 8 9 10 foot

775
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,519
board so on a curve you have infinite

776
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,000
numbers so i started equating all those

777
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,679
numbers of like the cannabis plant and

778
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,798
the piece of wood in the middle was like

779
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,960
the stalk

780
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,038
and that all those curves are all the

781
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,200
different terpenes so some people want a

782
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,558
narrow nose some people want a wide nose

783
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,159
and we want a middle one some people

784
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,839
want a narrow tail a wide tail some

785
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,520
people want a double wing swallow a pin

786
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,759
tail and all those are the different

787
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:02,000
terpenes and people like what are you

788
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,519
doing you're sacrificing so many pounds

789
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,278
of money and all that and i was all look

790
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,839
dude the money

791
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,519
is the money that i'm trying to figure

792
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,079
out what

793
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,798
all these terpenes are doing for

794
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,038
each person or different people and then

795
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,960
i realize like the whole plant you know

796
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,558
has a array of

797
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,640
terpenes versus

798
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,720
the bud on the north side of the plant

799
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,720
versus the south side of the plant the

800
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
east west the higher the lower salmon

801
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,159
fruit trees

802
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,240
so what's intrigued me with mixing the

803
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,000
farming with the cannabis is that all

804
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,679
those elements come into play and it

805
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
hasn't got that far down the road yet

806
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,200
with cannabis and it's just starting to

807
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,558
turn that way and it's real like really

808
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,080
exciting to me

809
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,079
yeah it's really exciting to watch the

810
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,879
crop science come out and

811
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,359
i'm fascinated by that analogy

812
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,880
that you had with the surfboards in my

813
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,199
mind i'm like picturing

814
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,520
three-dimensional curvature and like you

815
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,440
know moving the different

816
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,359
terpenes around to strike different

817
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,278
balances and achieve different healing

818
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,759
effects and also you know

819
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,319
different you know psychedelic and you

820
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,319
know different highs and flavors i'm a

821
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,558
flavor person too like

822
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,918
personally i think this

823
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,119
massive

824
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,759
selection for only 20 and higher up to

825
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,759
30 percent i think it's a disservice

826
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,839
to the entire lineage of the cannabis

827
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:25,519
plant because some of the most unique

828
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:29,439
strains most flavorful standout strains

829
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,960
are tested at 16 17

830
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,840
and they really

831
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,159
affect me just as potently but maybe not

832
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:41,038
as couchlock maybe the thc isn't quite

833
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,360
so high but all that entourage effect is

834
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,599
really important to me so i love that

835
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:49,398
analogy of how that all works i think

836
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,398
that's spectacular
