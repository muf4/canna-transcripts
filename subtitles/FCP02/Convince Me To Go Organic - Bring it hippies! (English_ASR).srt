00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,599
hey everybody chad westport here and i'm

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:18,879
sitting in my new spider farmer sc 5000

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,879
tent and i'm considering going organic

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,879
now i got a few hang-ups i got a few

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,079
problems a couple things in my mind i

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,679
just can't quite overcome so convince me

8
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,559
i'm wrong

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,759
but anyways it's a 4x4 tent ideally it

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,439
would be a three by three uh fabric

11
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,039
raised bed in here that i would use but

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,119
there's just a few things that you know

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,359
like i said i can't get my head around i

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,000
have a veg area and this will be a

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,238
flower area so if i'm running living

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,480
soil beds in here

17
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,198
how do i take it from my bed

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,159
and then put it into here

19
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,000
beware going from a non-living soil into

20
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,919
the living soil just for flowering don't

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,320
you think how do you transfer the two

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,399
you can't get the roots out i also don't

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,719
really like the idea of bugs whether

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,879
they're beneficial or not

25
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,400
not really trying to you know replicate

26
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,319
the wild kingdom

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,359
in my tent

28
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,839
but it's on my journey of exploring

29
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,840
going organic in here

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,759
who should i talk to who do you want to

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,400
see me bring on the show to try and

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
convince me i need to go with some

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
uh

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,079
living soil in here versus my normal

35
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,078
pots which i can move around easier

36
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,239
which i could fit more of which i could

37
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,519
transfer in and out easily

38
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,438
yeah

39
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:39,280
