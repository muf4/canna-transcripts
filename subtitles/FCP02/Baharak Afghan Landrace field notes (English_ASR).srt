00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:08,339
hello October 30th another field notes

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,679
this is from our Afghan uh selection uh

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,460
this is uh one more variety and this is

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,560
called Baja Rock

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,900
Baja Rock

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,320
and uh what's really interesting about

7
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:24,899
this particular Afghan is all the other

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,018
Afghans we grew were The Squatty really

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,899
dense thick uh extremely Indica like

10
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:33,000
structure but this Barack and we had

11
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,000
another one we already harvested

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,460
have more what you could be considered

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,558
more of a sativa type bud structure

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,500
where they're just a long

15
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,439
thin Spear and then the leaves are also

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,259
uh thin instead of the big wide Indica

17
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:52,859
type leaves so this seems to have more

18
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:55,140
of a sativa influence uh and then also

19
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,500
what's really unique about these flowers

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,058
is they're just very open and Airy and

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,238
separated so I don't know if you can

22
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:06,060
come in on this and where you can see so

23
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:10,579
it's almost like foxtails of foxtails of

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,740
foxtails all on this big giant spear

25
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,879
so and who knows maybe this would be a

26
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,759
good

27
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:21,060
uh like hash washing

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,978
uh uh trait just because it's so open

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,140
and all the crystals there would be

30
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:28,200
super accessible but anyway so this is

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,759
just very unique for an Afghan to have

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,618
this structure uh the nose is

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,259
is nothing

34
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,938
I mean it's pleasant but it's not

35
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:41,819
mind-blowing and loud or

36
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,399
yeah it just kind of smells clean and

37
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,618
fresh but not super loud but who knows

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,180
once it cures out the flavor could be

39
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:49,920
amazing and the effects could be

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,280
absolutely amazing just while it's

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,340
growing it's not it's a crazy crazy loud

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,019
smelling plant but it is gorgeous and I

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,439
think it's about

44
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:04,798
it's hard to tell when these are red but

45
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:07,500
uh and I don't see a speck of mold so

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,479
yeah looking good just another very

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,180
unique cool plant that we'd never know

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,239
about unless we tried growing it so here

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,659
it is and again thank you to everyone uh

50
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,420
in Afghanistan because these genetics

51
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:23,280
are incredibly impressive so it's just

52
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:27,539
an honor to be able to grow these plants

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,419
here in Santa Cruz and just so stoked

54
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,878
that there's amazing cannabis breeders

55
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:35,219
and cultivators all over this planet so

56
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,539
hopefully someday we'll all unite in

57
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:40,680
some way but right now we connect

58
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:43,378
through seeds and genetics so anyway

59
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,300
oh it's October 30th if I didn't say

60
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:47,299
that already anyway Barack
