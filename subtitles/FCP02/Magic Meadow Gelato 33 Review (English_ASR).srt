nothing for sale strain review today

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,719
specifically talking about magic meadow

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,719
farms gelato 33.

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,358
we're super excited about this one we

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,358
were gifted at the emerald cup a few

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
weekends ago

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
it smells really incredible we've had

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,399
the chance to smoke it a few times now

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,839
we we believe that this is outdoor og

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,280
here will tell you a little bit more

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,480
about the really interesting grow

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,600
conditions that led to this product but

20
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,359
this is some serious serious gelato so

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,120
we were told by the growers at magic

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,920
meadow farms that

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,718
this was grown from the ashes of the

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,520
northern california wildfires

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,558
from a very fertile land uh in theory

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,920
probably

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,640
uh ripe with nutrients so they were able

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,478
to turn a very tragic thing into a very

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,519
beneficial and positive thing for their

30
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:14,079
farm and rise up from the ashes with

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,920
this crop and other crops and end up

32
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,879
actually competing in the emerald cup

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,478
with this

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,640
and one thing that magic meadow

35
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,039
emphasized during our conversations was

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,599
the importance of land restoration

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,600
really their focus is around growing

38
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,000
phenomenal product

39
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,719
as well as contributing to the soil

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,118
health and and the regenerative

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,679
practices in their area i think that we

42
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,280
are always really excited when

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,118
sort of the product that we consume can

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,599
align to our larger values and this

45
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:46,159
certainly meets that criteria totally

46
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,519
yeah we we feel really good supporting

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,719
grassroots organic farmers

48
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,319
ultimately

49
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,759
that's where people can

50
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,839
build community and educate other

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,399
growers and everybody can support each

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,159
other speaking of northern california i

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,000
think that gelato in a lot of ways is a

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,040
pretty classic northern california

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,359
strain this is the 33 fina which is one

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,879
of the the more common i know that

57
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,199
people are really excited about all of

58
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,639
them now the 41 and the 45 are really

59
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,878
popular but also at this point people

60
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,639
are excited about the jello the guava

61
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,719
and and so it's nice to have someone

62
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,199
bringing it back to what i sort of

63
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,598
considered to be the classic the 33 it's

64
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,759
it's earthy and sweet and i think best

65
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,598
described uh like you said earlier as

66
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,039
being very reminiscent of sure but

67
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,119
there's a cooling quality to it that's

68
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,359
really pleasant um and i'm sort of

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,439
excited to spark this up and see see how

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,800
the 33 flavor translates with magic

71
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,598
meadow totally yeah like i said and like

72
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,040
pax said the uh oh thank you pax he just

73
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,518
passed me this

74
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,079
doink that we just rolled up right here

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,719
so like pax and i were saying the sunset

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,200
sherbet flavor is really pronounced in

77
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,680
this cut of gelato 33.

78
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,679
ultimately it's a very very

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,959
sweet earthy

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,439
delicious

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,319
smoke and in both a vaporizer or a

82
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,079
uh

83
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,878
joint like this doink that we rolled up

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,959
right here it absolutely

85
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,959
shines the couple times we smoke this it

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,640
actually reminds me of jealousy which is

87
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,640
a strain that people are really excited

88
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,479
about right now which is just

89
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,958
background putting the gelato on to the

90
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,280
sunset sherbet but i do think as as

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,280
we've gone ahead and smelled and hit dry

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
puffs of this joint to this point that

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,840
the sherb is really coming out and i'm

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,360
stoked to spark

95
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,439
it yeah i'm super stoked as well this

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,519
joint looks really good it's a fatty for

97
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,840
sure and uh

98
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,080
really excited for those uh delicious

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
kind of sweet earthy

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,159
um almost like

101
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,238
kind of like fermented fruity but still

102
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,598
like very delicious like jam-like

103
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
flavors to come through from that

104
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,318
sherbet so we are going to be smoking

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840
this today in both a

106
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,958
vaporizer

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,280
and

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,799
a joint

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,479
it tastes really good in both of them

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,799
the effects come through strongly in

111
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,679
both of them uh overall it's a very

112
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,680
stony smoke

113
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,039
this is a fatty

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,638
hell yeah

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,639
smoking great already

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
i can already smell that gelato

117
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,040
sweetness coming off the joint totally

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,879
yeah like i said

119
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,960
there's a lot of sherb in it but you do

120
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,478
get those desserty flavors as well that

121
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,478
are very reminiscent of gelato

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,800
i haven't even hit it yet but i can tell

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,120
there's a creaminess to the smoke

124
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,280
definitely and in this kind of joint i

125
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,600
mean it's just absolutely like

126
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,559
such a flavor rush on your palate to

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,560
smoke

128
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,360
i'm gonna even out our burn here on the

129
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
joint real quick

130
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,439
gotta waste something to taste some

131
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,038
exactly

132
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,279
as many know you got to waste it to

133
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,399
taste it whether you're smoking dabs or

134
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,399
lighting up the end of that joint

135
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,439
we're definitely getting

136
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,279
closer to a nice even burn

137
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,719
so i'm about to pass this joint to pax

138
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,719
but i want one more hit first

139
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,240
or maybe two

140
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,919
that's looking real nice

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,160
yeah it's delicious here take this man

142
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
thank you brother i'm really excited to

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,160
hit this and hold this up beautifully

144
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
it's smoking good

145
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,599
there is more of an earthiness in this

146
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,439
outdoor expression of um gelato 33 than

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,520
a lot of the indoor expressions that

148
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,639
i've had the pleasure of trying and i

149
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,918
think that this highlights how

150
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:03,519
epigenetic factors can really contribute

151
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,680
to to the flavor and the potency of of

152
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,719
flour this this does have

153
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,519
more of a toasty almost kind of toasted

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,639
rice thing going on in addition to that

155
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,799
super sweet creamy it's almost like a

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,439
toasted rice milk tea if you've ever had

157
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,680
that from a boba spot which is delicious

158
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,918
do you get that toasted rice milk tea is

159
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,160
a great comparison

160
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,758
just feeling that on my palate

161
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
is making me actually want to drink one

162
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,560
right now

163
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,918
we might have to get one of those later

164
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,000
today yeah this is definitely a good um

165
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,240
yeah good representation that flavor it

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,319
it feels terpy on my throat that's one

167
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,800
thing that i enjoy with a lot of the

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,280
outdoor varieties that we've been trying

169
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,720
you do get that

170
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,959
it almost feels like the monoterp thing

171
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,680
when you hit some truly fresh press

172
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,959
right off the right off the press

173
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,800
where it's

174
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,560
i don't want to say caustic but it's

175
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
it's a volatile thing that you feel in

176
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
your throat yeah um

177
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,519
it's enjoyable i don't mean to make it

178
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,199
sound negative at all no it's a great

179
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,799
feeling it definitely tickles your

180
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,280
palate and tickles your taste buds

181
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
tickles your nasal cavities

182
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,478
it's from the terps

183
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,919
so now we're about to do the smell test

184
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,478
pax has got the jar right now and he's

185
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,959
going to give you his thoughts

186
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:22,719
it definitely does smell like a sherby

187
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,638
gelato um there is that that cooling

188
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,639
thing going on

189
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,400
but to me

190
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,400
it kind of smells like a bread and

191
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,318
butter pickle yeah i think that's the

192
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,079
note i'm getting most i'm excited to get

193
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,240
a sniff but when i smelled it before the

194
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,839
video it definitely was reminiscent of

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,160
those flavors

196
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:44,119
let me bust this open

197
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,120
all right guys crack in the jar

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
i get the sweetness from the bread and

199
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,960
butter pickle

200
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,240
i get candy sweetness funny enough

201
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,079
almost similar to like a lifesaver maybe

202
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,199
like a red or a

203
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:01,758
pineapple lifesaver i definitely feel

204
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,598
that that that is very much there

205
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,598
and definitely the earthiness and

206
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,478
definitely the fruitiness from the

207
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,038
sherbet

208
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,279
sunset sherbet i believe

209
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:17,598
overall it smells great

210
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:20,079
so i filled the davinci iqc with

211
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,399
some of this gelato 33 from magic meadow

212
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,279
farms

213
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,799
i

214
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,839
rock it at the top temperature for the

215
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
max vapor

216
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,359
basically i'm going to let it heat up

217
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:35,120
and then we'll hit it and we will tell

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,120
you our impression based on the vapor

219
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,598
all right now we are up to temp on this

220
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,599
thing so let's uh take a hit

221
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
it's pretty good it's really good

222
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,399
actually

223
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,240
the flavor from the sherbet is so good

224
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,200
in the vaporizer because you're just

225
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,759
getting those uh resin glands vaporized

226
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,759
on the flower

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,680
versus burning all the material

228
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,919
classic just vaporizer stuff

229
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,039
i'm excited to hit it it's good though

230
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,278
the um

231
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,079
the lifesaver sherby flavor really comes

232
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,919
through

233
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
in the vaporizer and it does in the

234
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,759
joint too but i think it's definitely

235
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
more prominent in the vaporizer

236
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,759
yeah it actually this vapes incredibly

237
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,599
well um yeah that would be my preferred

238
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,958
medium for creating this and i think

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
that for outdoor

240
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,199
it we should definitely start using the

241
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
vaporizer every time because totally

242
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,560
as well as a lot of the really sherb

243
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,839
heavy like rs 11 strands that people

244
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,599
love

245
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,320
and when you can get this from the earth

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,720
and the sunlight you might as well

247
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
definitely that's a real treat yeah it's

248
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,399
actually

249
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,399
it's very very enjoyable

250
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,600
wow i would recommend vaping this all

251
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,958
day long yeah definitely recommend

252
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,959
vaping this it's really good

253
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,879
as you can see there's like

254
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,879
definitely like some vapor from it

255
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,599
that is one of the better vaping

256
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,120
buds i've ever encountered absolutely

257
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,480
i've been very pleasantly uh pleasantly

258
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,200
rewarded when i put this in the

259
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
vaporizer

260
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,559
i don't want to say surprise because i

261
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,000
know it's good bud

262
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,319
and am i

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,639
wild for feeling like it hit me much

264
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
more quickly out of the davinci i think

265
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,439
you're getting a much more pure

266
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
expression of those cannabinoids and

267
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,480
terpenes and flavonoids and the various

268
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,838
compounds that cause the entourage

269
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,680
effect

270
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,560
probably just straight to the dome from

271
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,639
the vaporizer compared to in the joint i

272
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,919
don't have any data or proof about that

273
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,360
but it just

274
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,159
smokes good i'm going to pass the drip

275
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,519
back to you and hold on to the vapor

276
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,958
for sure

277
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,839
yeah this joint's looking good smoking

278
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,639
good too nice white

279
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,640
ash

280
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,199
oh my goodness but we did probably put

281
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,720
around two grams in that joint yeah

282
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,640
probably about two grams and we probably

283
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,600
put around point one five grams yeah bit

284
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,958
little paper vaporizer and

285
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,200
to be totally honest i'm enjoying the

286
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,799
the vape significantly more the

287
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160
vaporizer hits really nice with this

288
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,078
stuff i mean the

289
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,319
resin is expertly crafted that's for

290
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,919
sure and um

291
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
you know props to the farmers for doing

292
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,719
a great job seriously

293
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,639
wow this is uh

294
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,639
i want to show you guys if i can get

295
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,000
this to focus nicely

296
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,000
absolutely leaking resin

297
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,319
that's like a

298
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,639
at least a half inch resin ring

299
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,079
as with all of the outdoor um that we've

300
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,879
gotten um

301
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:54,399
as a part of this reviewing cycle

302
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,838
i i'm super impressed i know that um

303
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,320
magic meadow

304
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,000
farms is also running some really cool

305
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
like 11 week

306
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,440
really long flowering hazels we got a

307
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,639
chance to try some of those and they're

308
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,120
wonderful i'm curious around their sort

309
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,039
of whole stable

310
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,639
genetic stable i think i'd want to try

311
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,799
all of it after this i i definitely

312
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,399
think it's one of the few

313
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,679
times i've enjoyed vaping more than

314
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
smoking which is really interesting

315
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,759
