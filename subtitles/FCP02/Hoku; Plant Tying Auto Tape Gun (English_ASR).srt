1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,180
check it out so I've seen uh the orchard

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:09,300
guys use these things for uh you know

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:12,300
tying up Vines and whatnot but uh

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,759
finally got one for the farm and it's

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,480
just a uh Auto taper like typically I've

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,480
used that green

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,960
metal twine

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,320
to save a lot of time

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,698
see here

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,699
hard to do with one hand but

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:36,119
just uh Staples and uh

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,360
plastic tape so

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,280
trying to get away from using a trellis

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,799
um it definitely serves a purpose and

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,980
it's you know quick and quick and dirty

16
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,058
but I don't know we'll see how uh I like

17
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:49,738
it

18
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:51,299
probably made a bunch of work for myself

19
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,519
but uh

20
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,799
be nice just working on the plants not

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,719
having to get tangled up especially

22
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,578
Harvest Time

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,100
so

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,600
yeah you haven't uh seen one of these

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,899
and still tying up your plants check

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,899
them out
