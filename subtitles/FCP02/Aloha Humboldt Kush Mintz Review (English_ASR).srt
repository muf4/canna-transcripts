00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,000
what up future cannabis project we're

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,919
here with another strain review this

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
time we have some cushmits we're super

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,439
stoked about this we've already smoked

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,240
it a bit and it's fire for sure um grown

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,600
by aloha humboldt sun grown as we

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,598
understand it outdoor again um and again

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,760
i think proving that outdoor can be

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,399
really really good quality

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,399
definitely man i mean this stuff does

12
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,719
not disappoint

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,799
the flavor is on point the smoke is on

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,160
point and

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,439
it's taken out of the jar here i mean

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,558
these these are big nugs they're not

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,919
even wanting to come out of the jar on

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,199
their own

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,480
gotta pull them out there we go

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,840
um

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,959
yeah just taking this out here you can

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,800
see

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
really nice kind of

24
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,399
dark color on the cushions

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,480
i see one of those notes of course dude

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
here we go um

27
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,959
yeah i mean it's sticky

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,798
it smells good first smells kind of like

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,199
tea tree kind of like

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,200
mentholated almost uh

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,200
with

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,719
those are like cushbonk

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,438
totally no i agree with everything you

34
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,920
said

35
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,399
there's a subtlety to the tea tree thing

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,118
it's it's like eucalyptus

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,799
there's almost a seaweed smell to it and

38
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,159
there's definitely

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,759
a bit of a

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,400
funkiness

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,519
it's kind of like aloe

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,520
and there's a bit of a fermented lactic

43
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,920
funk thing that

44
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,359
has an age quality almost like bonito

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,439
flakes

46
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,599
definitely cracking open the jar my

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,679
first reaction was ultimately just

48
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,719
bonito flake funk for those who don't

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
know what bonito flakes are it's a

50
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,879
it's like a fish flake that's on

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,718
japanese food it's kind of smoky funky

52
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,039
almost kind of cushy and delicious

53
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:02,239
definitely like

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,520
not a bad funk super umami

55
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,599
yeah yeah

56
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,798
um and the texture of this is kind of

57
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,878
crumbly

58
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,120
it is dried and carried very well

59
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,679
again the sun grown

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,800
buds are providing this really

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,560
great tactile element where it's it's

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,879
there's a tackiness

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,159
and there's like a slick almost oiliness

64
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,120
to the buds

65
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,199
it is not just enormous swollen

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,719
trichomes that you could almost shake

67
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,359
off

68
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,280
it i mean it's sticky man it is very

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
sticky breaking it apart

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
there's definitely some good well-grown

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,080
resin on there um my fingers are sticky

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,560
after having broken that down

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,280
um grinding it up too like when you

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,439
shape it into a joint it just it's

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
really nice i mean it uh just shapes

76
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,560
into that cone or whatever shape you

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
want to be really perfectly without

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,439
having to compact it together and mess

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,760
up your airflow too much it's ultimately

80
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,000
just really really pleasant flower to

81
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,919
roll up and really nice to break down

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,039
and that inner resin when you crack the

83
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,759
nug has more of that aloe freshness

84
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,079
totally the more i smell this the more i

85
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,639
enjoy it and notice

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,280
the nuances that

87
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,799
are more typical of cushions

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
yeah i mean like

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
having you know smoked probably two

90
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
joints before this video

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
uh

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
well done

93
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,238
sun grown outdoor and greenhouse

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,799
cannabis thanks to uh peter at future

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,799
cannabis project

96
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,639
it's a nice joint already burning white

97
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,639
yeah i think the the smoke on this is

98
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,039
what is most impressive

99
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,878
we went through the nose and the

100
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,719
appearance but

101
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,399
i i don't think those would be this

102
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,560
necessarily the standout qualities that

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
i'd highlight it it's the smoke on this

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,878
that is so

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,878
wonderful yeah it smokes super super

106
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,878
well

107
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
resin ring begins to form instantly like

108
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,079
you said

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,080
the ash is clean which not the bl

110
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,799
envelope but indicative of a healthy

111
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,959
environment for sure totally

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
i mean yeah i don't know

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,238
i like to see a white ash it might not

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,319
mean anything who knows it might mean

115
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,358
everything but i like to see it

116
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,839
um

117
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,918
and a lot of good stuff usually has it

118
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,159
um

119
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,439
man this stuff is just really delightful

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,759
you know we're just breaking into

121
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,478
another joint here and

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
it's uh

123
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,199
it's got very like kind of stupefying

124
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,799
effects almost but it doesn't sedate you

125
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,600
it makes you want to like get up and

126
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,079
like have fun or do something you know

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,400
do something active it's stoner movie

128
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,918
weed it makes me like you know i feel

129
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,799
the pressure

130
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,000
here

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
but it makes me want to like kind of

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,040
like squeeze my eyes together and like

133
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,519
just like

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,520
smoke a bunch

135
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,520
this joint would rival a lot of the best

136
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,800
stuff on the market totally and it's

137
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,560
really strong

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,520
yeah i like this i

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,600
i think it's best suited for

140
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:13,680
evening use because it has

141
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,879
some woozy qualities

142
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,720
but that does speak to a really good

143
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,719
product

144
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,800
yeah definitely i agree

145
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,720
this stuff is really really good it does

146
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,439
have that bubba in the smoke there's

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,919
that sweet quality um there definitely

148
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,759
is it is lighter than some of the super

149
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,519
potent ventilated strains that are being

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,600
you know distributed right now and are

151
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,198
equally interesting but this does have a

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,320
softer more organic cut

153
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,319
shout out to aloha humboldt and peter

154
