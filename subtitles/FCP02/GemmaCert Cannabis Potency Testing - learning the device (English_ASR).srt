[Music]

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,839
so this is the gemma cert or gamma cert

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,719
depending on where you're from

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,480
it's a

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,038
near-infrared spectrometer that gives

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
you cannabinoid content readouts as well

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,400
as

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,639
active water content and it's uh powered

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,598
by android so we got this android phone

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,199
right here

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,960
we are gonna fire up the app and see

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,120
what it's like

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,759
so i've got some weed here this is just

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:41,039
something from a friend

17
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,759
unnamed farmer unnamed genetic untested

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,640
previously but we're gonna test it and

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,799
we're going to see what kind of

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,120
cannabinoid content we can get

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,919
first though i am going to take a bong

22
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,919
rip out of my sovereignty

23
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,680
so what you do is you place this nug

24
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,438
on a magnet with a needle

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
and that needle holds it in place for

26
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,839
the spectrometer

27
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,519
and then the device does analysis just

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
on the whole nug i think you can also

29
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,200
use ground flower too but primarily i've

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,560
just been testing it out like this so

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,320
far

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,519
so now i'm going to open the sample

33
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,639
container

34
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,719
so the next step is actually

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,000
you take this

36
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,640
and you

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,319
pop the sample

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,478
in there

39
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,919
and then

40
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,920
you close it

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,200
like this

42
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,319
and then on the phone you hit

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,240
analyze

44
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,239
all right i've inserted my flower sample

45
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,159
and then it runs analysis

46
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,239
so this is really interesting the

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,600
analysis just finished and it gave me a

48
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,359
notice that said

49
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,758
low water activity which makes sense

50
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,280
because it's some pretty dry bud

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,519
we're gonna hit

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,919
okay

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,599
click on our results

54
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,598
okay so it says we have to remove our

55
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,039
sample

56
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,598
some good bud

57
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,759
it's definitely some good bud

58
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:29,679
all right

59
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,679
now let's check on our results

60
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,359
nice

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,519
okay so our total thc for this one was

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,319
thirteen point two percent

63
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,599
total cbd was point two percent

64
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:47,280
total cbg was two percent and our active

65
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,878
water content was under point five five

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,680
um

67
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,759
i think gem assert uh is really cool for

68
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
doing the active water content that's

69
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,280
really important for uh you know testing

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,120
your crop to make sure that you either

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,080
don't have molds or you know testing

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
your dry or other things like that your

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,360
cure

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
but

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,959
yeah cool device

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,158
um and you know like i said

77
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,800
13 thc on some

78
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,799
beautiful

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,840
beautiful dank bud

80
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,239
it's definitely not some swag guys this

81
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,318
is some good butt

82
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,319
so what i find most interesting about

83
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,479
this device and uh i'm about to go in

84
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,560
for another bomber up here

85
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:38,158
but what i find most interesting about

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,519
this device is that it uh offers a

87
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:45,039
possibly more accurate way to test your

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,280
cannabinoids than to go to a lab that

89
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,079
you know in theory is inflating results

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,719
to match market trends or hype versus

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,480
giving an accurate readout um i think at

92
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,400
first i was

93
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,438
and you know i'm not an expert so who

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,280
knows but

95
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,079
at first i was

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,000
astounded by how low some of the

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,400
thc readouts were

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,598
but you know my critical thinking side

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,640
of my brain

100
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:09,840
um

101
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,119
you know

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,479
basically led me to believe that

103
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
this could be giving

104
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,798
more accurate results and the test

105
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,160
results that we're used to in the high

106
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,719
20s and

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,080
30s could be a

108
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,600
fabrication

109
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,279
of what the actual content is i could be

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,199
wrong but i've always had a sneaking

111
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,279
suspicion that some of those results are

112
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,759
fabricated especially on the metric

113
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,758
recreational california market

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,919
i feel like you know a lot of consumers

115
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,919
are

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,800
misled and led to believe that high thc

117
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,839
equals you know good effects or high thc

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,120
equals

119
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:54,478
quality um or just you know

120
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,319
among other you know deceptive practices

121
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,959
that high thc is what you want to be

122
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,399
looking for over any other factors such

123
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,478
as you know

124
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,758
the harvest date or the actual aroma the

125
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,680
terpenes

126
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,639
um you know the

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,800
quality of the bud when you look at it

128
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,038
things like that that matter more than

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,560
thc percentage

130
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,839
however we do think this is a really

131
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,759
cool device

132
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,599
and we're looking forward to doing more

133
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,439
work with it in the future testing

134
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
metric strains doing

135
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,240
comparisons

136
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,478
uh

137
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,720
yeah should be good but shout out to

138
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,719
everybody for watching leave a comment

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,280
uh about what you'd like to see us do

140
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,880
with the gem assert and also you know

141
