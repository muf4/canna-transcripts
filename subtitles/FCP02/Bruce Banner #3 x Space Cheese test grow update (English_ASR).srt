1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
it's been about a week since the update

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,559
we are on week six

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:11,599
of the testers from boneyard

4
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:14,558
um and the

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,480
cherry pie and bruce banner number three

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,679
that he said

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,160
let's see i sent tony an update today

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,600
and he actually posted about it on his

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,719
uh grump so

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,039
if you haven't seen i'm going to tell

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:31,518
you about a few of the

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,640
issues that i've had with um

13
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:37,759
i guess both tents but mostly

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,399
tony's tester 10.

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,399
the first issue was a timer issue now

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,239
it was one of these which has the 15

17
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:52,000
minute little prongs that you can

18
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,479
you can pump out but you can see that

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,878
little

20
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,718
see that little piece right there so

21
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:01,039
that's sticking out

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:05,118
just enough so that when it went around

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:08,640
it was clicking off for like 15 minutes

24
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,879
uh not to mention instead of unplugging

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,879
this

26
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,879
i tried to get my arms into a really

27
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,199
tight spot

28
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,560
and i was trying to punch it in like

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,240
this not really

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,000
able to see so when i was setting it for

31
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:29,359
what i thought was 13 hours and 11

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,959
hours i was actually setting it to 1410

33
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,879
which initiated flour but

34
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,879
it kind of stalled it out a little bit

35
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,000
and then that extra 15 minutes

36
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:44,319
it just didn't really

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,920
didn't like it so finally when i

38
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,478
recognized uh the problem the issue

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,840
which was

40
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:56,000
i don't know about 10 12 days ago now

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,478
um i

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,640
switched the timer to 1212. i was

43
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:09,280
getting fancy and i should look secondly

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,400
um my fluence bioengineering spider 2x

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,039
was starting to have some maybe driver

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,360
issues

47
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,759
or cord connectivity issues but there

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,640
was

49
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,759
something going on one of the videos i

50
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,878
was doing and

51
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,239
for a facebook group the light just

52
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,799
turned off

53
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,800
it just went

54
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,640
i know tony i know but

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,720
i know you're right you're right

56
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:46,079
um but the light just turned off so

57
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:49,598
i was i was kind of cut off

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,280
guard i didn't along with

59
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:56,399
the timer thing happening now i had

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,759
that the light actually turning off

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,120
on itself and then coming back on at

62
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,359
random times um i had no idea i was

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,120
doing that so i caught it then and

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,760
i was like you were watching yeah i was

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,200
like

66
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:16,318
what the [ __ ] is going on so you know i

67
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,199
tapping it and um you know supreme grape

68
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,878
you're not wrong

69
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,598
they are risky and the digital ones

70
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,439
aren't

71
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,039
any of the timers are risky i wish there

72
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,719
was a

73
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:31,598
a real foolproof way to do it you know

74
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,239
even me going by my own clock if i went

75
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,759
to try and

76
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,200
turn it on and turn it off at 12 12 that

77
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,039
that's not going to work i have too much

78
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,238
stuff going on to be here

79
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,239
right at that moment but

80
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
yeah that's what mine started doing big

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,560
jar exactly

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,680
and um when when i show you i'll i'll

83
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,158
show you right

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
where the single bladed sleeves started

85
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:56,959
coming out i was like

86
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,840
well this isn't right there's going to

87
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,920
be something going on

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,519
i uh there were no light i mean

89
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,518
no light leaks that would affect

90
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,200
anything

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:14,480
so uh and i checked the timer and

92
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:16,639
boom that was it smart plugs

93
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,159
smart plugs the the why are those the

94
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,959
wi-fi ones tony

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,240
that like alert your phone if the timer

96
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,680
goes weird

97
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
ganja grower how's it going man

98
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
yeah i just i wish there was a true

99
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,879
foolproof way

100
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,080
a little foolproof way

101
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,399
uh i'm

102
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,039
i guess i just number two rule of the

103
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,079
galaxy right be aware usually i just

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,120
should have paid better attention

105
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:53,279
uh so

106
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:57,120
okay so we've talked about one two three

107
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,918
right lights timer

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,918
light timer

109
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,478
is that only two i feel like there's

110
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,478
something else

111
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:13,680
that kevin got me poker

112
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,719
ah heat thank you tony um also

113
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,840
number three we had this like weird

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,520
spell of almost a straight

115
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,679
week of um abnormal

116
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,680
high temperatures in on the coast of

117
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,959
maine we were like

118
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,959
89 90 degrees

119
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:38,120
so with the lights on uh my 10

120
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:42,239
even with my ac running was at like

121
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,120
87 degrees i mean i had a ban on

122
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,560
i had this big fan blowing the ac right

123
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
in here there's

124
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,879
nothing i can do so like a week of

125
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,439
really high [ __ ] temps um

126
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,399
and it so here's that comes in threes

127
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,038
thing right

128
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,519
and that all happened within like 10

129
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,560
days of each other or at least

130
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,519
i noticed it all within probably less

131
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,680
than 10 days but

132
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,719
i'll give myself a little buffer and say

133
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
10 days

134
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,479
um all within 10 minutes so it was like

135
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,280
boom boom boom

136
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,279
ah [ __ ] so here's the thing

137
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:26,000
these testers have now been

138
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,840
tested like legit stress

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,279
[ __ ] tested during the

140
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,918
the weeks that if you stress out

141
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,279
your girls they're gonna show you some

142
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,318
[ __ ] up

143
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,519
signs of like wanting to do something

144
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,840
that you don't want them to do

145
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:49,038
i i.e manners the beginning of seeds

146
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:53,359
uh whatever else

147
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:56,879
may occur these are showing nothing

148
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:01,199
these are showing no signs of

149
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:04,240
any manners no shot no signs of any

150
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,879
any hermaphroditic traits at all

151
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,639
uh the only thing was a little bit of

152
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,918
revenge for probably about a week

153
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,360
and now they are like they're firing off

154
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:19,519
so no thank you tony

155
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,598
i mean uh dude that

156
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,439
pretty [ __ ] bulletproof i would i

157
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,319
would say so man like

158
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,279
i mean i i generally take good care of

159
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,400
my plants

160
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,198
and like it just goes to show you

161
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,198
no matter how

162
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,520
good you take care of your stuff there's

163
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,719
there can always be something that pops

164
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,560
up that like

165
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,039
you don't plan for and um that's why i

166
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,478
i always like when people say what is

167
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,399
what's the number one thing you would

168
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,918
tell new growers

169
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,638
and i i go with i go with patience

170
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,399
and don't panic like that's the number

171
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,720
one rule of the galaxy after all don't

172
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,719
panic

173
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,159
so

174
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,919
i didn't panic and things you know if i

175
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,360
had panic

176
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:15,758
who knows what i would have done

177
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,680
been a [ __ ] and added a bunch of stuff

178
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,639
uh put more

179
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,079
gypsum in or more kelp or more alpha you

180
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,519
know what i mean like just

181
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,598
been like oh no but it was

182
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,560
it was something easy and just like the

183
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,439
light schedule

184
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,440
you know and

185
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,679
we'll go in the timeout 10 reports from

186
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,839
seeds out of

187
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,838
144 crosses i made with the angel

188
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,959
i don't have anything to say man i'm i'm

189
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,000
it just the other day i was like these

190
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,079
things

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,679
when you guys see these come out if they

192
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,440
if tony likes them enough to

193
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,879
to send them out it's like you guys

194
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,320
better jump on these because

195
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,240
these things are i don't know what

196
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,680
i don't even know if i can kill them you

197
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
know what i mean i might chop them and

198
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,359
they might just [ __ ]

199
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,080
just keep growing end up like a little

200
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,399
shop of horrors or something

201
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,399
but let's take you in there um

202
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,159
it is dennis you're right you know i

203
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,680
mean mistakes come

204
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:29,838
in lots of different forms uh some big

205
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,838
some small but as long as you

206
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,879
keep your keep your head level and don't

207
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,639
panic and just kind of

208
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:40,000
keep one foot going in front of the

209
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,000
other forward like

210
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,879
things are going to work out in a in a

211
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,360
positive way

212
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,480
and they may not always be the positive

213
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,480
way that you are

214
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,080
searching for it may be the positive way

215
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,759
that you need

216
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,320
and in saying that it may be

217
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,519
actually a negative feeling to you that

218
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,959
makes you change

219
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,959
doing something you know so

220
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,759
uh life is funny

221
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,919
and things work out that way you know uh

222
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,919
we

223
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,360
was it the rolling stones right you

224
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,640
can't always get what you want you get

225
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,399
what you need so

226
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:27,120
it comes in sometimes we need that

227
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,600
that anvil to drop on us out of the sky

228
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,519
to

229
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,720
really make us see

230
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,759
something different you know perpetual

231
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
harvest

232
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,799
um so i

233
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,879
have one of those going at the other

234
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,759
grow i don't have one here

235
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,720
i i just i don't have any care to do a

236
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,919
perpetual here

237
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,959
i haven't really found the

238
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,879
exact you know if i'm gonna use a

239
00:10:52,958 --> 00:11:01,119
perpetual

240
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:03,439
in my living soil bed um

241
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,839
[ __ ] hard i'm too lazy to set it up

242
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:15,839
like that i have no want to do that

243
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:15,839
yeah i'll do that up at my buddy's place

244
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,480
yeah i mean tony i

245
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,040
i'm not gonna pretend to know anything

246
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,159
about breeding because

247
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,958
i don't um i've heard you talk about

248
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,679
breeding

249
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:35,838
and it's like

250
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,599
i pick up little bits and pieces each

251
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,519
time sometimes i'm able to put them

252
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,399
together and form a sentence and other

253
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,679
times i'm

254
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,759
i like keywords you know uh

255
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,679
of which i can't remember for [ __ ] right

256
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,958
now uh i do

257
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,399
but it's like ah so

258
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,958
okay let's take a look at the card i've

259
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,480
been [ __ ]

260
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,199
[ __ ] with you guys long enough

261
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,200
putting it off

262
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:07,439
okay so here we are we have six

263
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,159
different athenos now

264
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
i i want you to notice something here

265
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,000
see this light color

266
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,040
right light color on this plant and you

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,399
can see a lighter

268
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:21,599
lighter color on that plant over there

269
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,320
what's going on this this side a really

270
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,839
nice

271
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,839
beautiful full green right

272
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,680
two plants over there just like kind of

273
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
like

274
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,879
yo we're not digging something but it's

275
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,799
just us

276
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,399
two so which leads me to believe that

277
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,838
they are

278
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,600
possessing similar genetic qualities

279
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,440
right because right in the middle of

280
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,879
them is another plant

281
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,880
and look green

282
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,320
green so

283
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:57,360
um this could be

284
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,959
i you know i'm not sure

285
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,919
i'm not sure to be honest

286
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,278
um but it's something i noticed uh that

287
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,078
is only happening with those two and

288
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,799
there's one in the middle

289
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,319
and there's one on both sides of it so

290
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,838
i'm leaning towards it can only be

291
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,560
genetic

292
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,120
and whereas though i haven't grown any

293
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,559
of

294
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,560
the parental lines

295
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:27,360
i can't honestly say which side

296
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:31,120
it's leaning towards so

297
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:35,440
bob's cheddar thank you tony i i don't

298
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,639
i appreciate that man uh that's

299
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,760
that is special i uh i don't i

300
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,320
i don't i'm usually not

301
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,958
uh choked up for words but i i don't

302
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,879
even have words to uh

303
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:54,879
of appreciation for you that would

304
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:57,039
seem appropriate i don't know the words

305
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,240
so right now i'm hugging my phone is

306
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:03,838
what i'm doing

307
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,839
okay you get a big hug from cheddar bomb

308
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:14,959
uh no i haven't seen any variegation

309
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:19,198
um none none at all

310
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:22,239
actually on on any of these plants

311
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:25,838
now what

312
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,519
so just for fyi

313
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,839
when i'm going over the plants and you

314
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,799
see this residue here

315
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,079
that is residue from the the uh botana

316
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,679
guard

317
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:41,278
bavaria basiana that is

318
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:44,638
not pm there's no mold anywhere

319
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,198
on these plants um so that's what that

320
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,519
is

321
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,519
so don't even [ __ ] ask the question

322
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,639
yeah that i mean so these are the

323
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,480
the bruce banner three cross with space

324
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,600
cheese which is the blue cheese crossed

325
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,879
with tony's

326
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,560

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,720
crossed with the 95 romulan

330
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,120
or maybe the other way around am i right

331

437
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,480
reason

438
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,599

um

446
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:08,798
i find that hilarious so

447
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,120
it is what it is all right i didn't mean

448
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:16,480
to pause didn't mean to pause

449
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:19,119
okay um switch

450
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,360
so you can see structure-wise these

451
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,839
things are starting to fill out

452
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,439
but uh here i'll show you you can see

453
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:30,079
where they started re-veging

454
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:35,120
right one two three you see these little

455
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:38,158
one two little single blade here

456
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:41,359
right so they definitely

457
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,760
had about a week of revenge so instead

458
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,079
of

459
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:47,119
maybe eight to ten weeks these are

460
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:51,599
probably going to take

461
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:55,279
into the third week of july to finish

462
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:57,439
i'm hoping temperatures stay low

463
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,879
but if they don't i'm just gonna have to

464
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,759
grin and bear it you know and

465
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
it's it's my own fault but as of right

466
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,240

467
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,400

into this corner and show you the

476
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,240
structure of these these things

477
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,480
i might be able to hammer a nail with

478
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,240
these i even

479
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,440
like not drive these things are rock

480
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,319
[ __ ] hard and i'm

481
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,320
really hoping

482
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,038
that they um

483
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,558
you know follow the characteristics of

484
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,400
the rest of tony's gear

485
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:02,480
and what i mean by that is having

486
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,759
and being bred for really high medicinal

487
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,120
value

488
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:10,640
um and not just looks like a lot of

489
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,959
breeders do tony breeds

490
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,919
tony breeds for intent for medical

491
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,200
purposes his

492
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,280
his purposes aren't bag appeal

493
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,120
necessarily he likes good looking plants

494
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,158
don't get me wrong

495
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:28,558
but it's

496
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:32,000

497
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,440

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,159
them so i'm not going to but

507
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,840
like and they're not done

508
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,960
they're rocks the secondaries are

509
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:09,119
rocks so again

510
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,200
this is not pm this is wp-22 botana

511
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:14,959
guard

512
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:19,840
so let's see uh the new i i replaced

513
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,840
the fluence with this is called the ion

514
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,880
um ion 720

515
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,079
apparently this is made by growers

516
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,400
choice

517
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:36,720
but sold to ion to put their name on it

518
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,120
so it's basically a grower's choice 720

519
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,159
with someone else's name on it basically

520
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,158
what

521
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,360
what spider farmer and mars and all

522
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,880
those all those guys do

523
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:52,158
uh so i got this on the low and

524
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,559
i'm using it because i

525
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,840
i needed another light so there we go

526
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:01,278
we'll see we'll see how

527
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:04,558
we'll see how it runs do i chase bpd

528
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,960
no not really i mean i leave my tents

529
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,359
open

530
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,360
so it is what it is you know like right

531
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,959
now my temps are

532
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:16,879
my temp is at 81

533
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,880
and 56 percent

534
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:24,480
so yeah i get the light up to 80 percent

535
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:28,960
um is it a little warm

536
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,159
it might be what's my co2 co2 is at like

537
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,880
550

538
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:38,000
and i don't even run co2 so

539
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,400
there we go i don't know okay so let's

540
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,839
go over here to the other 10.

541
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,480
ambient co2 yeah yeah yeah

542
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,079
yeah it's not bad sometimes it gets like

543
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,919
it when the tents are closed

544
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,439
and i'll open it up it'll be up to like

545
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,080
700 or so

546
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,558
which is good that means my soils has

547
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,319
some

548
00:25:54,558 --> 00:26:01,440
good fungal action going on in it

549
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:06,720
to be producing some co2 i don't have

550
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,919
any necessarily like fruiting bodies

551
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,919
but the co2 is always

552
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,519
now tony i was talking to you about this

553
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,038
uh the other day

554
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:23,839
and i believe

555
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,359
i am on a boat supreme i'm always on a

556
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,480
boat man

557
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,199
i was born from the ocean born out of

558
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,919
salt water man

559
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:40,798
um so let's see

560
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,799
here see the crowning a little fox taily

561
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,319
right

562
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:55,200
now i'm thinking

563
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,480
it is my light because

564
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:02,558
i had a pink gorilla fino that

565
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:06,319
stretched very similar to the banner

566
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:11,038
um that also ended up

567
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,038
doing that crown sort of uh

568
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:20,319
foxtail so

569
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,359
but i mean i mean

570
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,359
flowers look great

571
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,278
i'm definitely not bummed out

572
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,879
about the way the the flowers go looking

573
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,839
up the stalk

574
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
i am a little bummed out at the top

575
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,398
flower

576
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,399
you know uh

577
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,079
but everything going up is looking

578
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,399
really nice

579
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:52,398
so it just leads me to believe that this

580
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,398
uh this led is just too strong

581
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,480
now if we come down to where the cherry

582
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,519
pie

583
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,839
is look at that look what's not doing

584
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:06,240
that

585
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:11,918
right i mean this cherry pie is like

586
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,919
[ __ ] ridiculous right now

587
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:22,798
and it still has what two weeks i think

588
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:27,360
i mean i mean come on

589
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:29,759
i mean come on look at the calyxes

590
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,199
look at those look at the calyxes

591
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,798
there's like

592
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,720
there's like there's a little bit of

593
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,359
leaf do you know how easy that is gonna

594
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,360
be to trim

595
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:47,120
that's gonna be so easy to trim

596
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,278
ceramic metal halide down to 315 watts

597
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:53,599
and this is turned down to

598
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:56,000
oh probably 70

599
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,000
70

600
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:04,319
so we'll see we'll see what happens

601
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:06,798
um i know i'm gonna get a decent yield

602
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,918
um and i have some clones of the bruce

603
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:12,079
banner

604
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:15,520
that i'm gonna run for a second time

605
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:17,119
um in one of the tents

606
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,839
i may take it up to my buddies and use

607
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:23,599
one of his tents

608
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:25,199
uh i'm not sure yet but i do have some

609
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,798
because i want to run it again and see

610
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,080
if it was the lights and see if the

611
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:33,759
structure changes a whole lot

612
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:37,519
under you know getting to know it

613
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,359
better so and then

614
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,319
i definitely took cuttings of this

615
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,678
cherry pie which i am going to actually

616
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,000
i've already got a plan i'm going to

617
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,840
refill this bed

618
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,599
um with cherry pie

619
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,519
and i think i'm gonna i want to put like

620
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:57,119
12 of them in here

621
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,119
not really um

622
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,440
maybe maybe 18 of them in solo cups you

623
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,120
know just

624
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:09,038
[ __ ] jam them right in uh

625
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:11,199
vegem up to the screen or even take the

626
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,839
[ __ ] screen right off

627
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,519
and uh and veg them for like two weeks

628
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,199
and flower

629
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,519
because that cherry pie is [ __ ]

630
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,200
phenomenal i really

631
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:27,599
am enjoying the way it looks so

632
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,600
yeah baby yes in the bed

633
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:34,880
you think it's it's a spin so

634
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,840
what do what would you say that it is

635
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
too

636
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:45,119
too much in um to make them

637
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,120
do that too much

638
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:53,600
too much uv maybe

639
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,599
or too much far red

640
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:01,200
i have not mainly og

641
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:07,918
um

642
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:10,720
you know i i branch i branch trim so

643
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,038
you know down here all i have to do is

644
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,960
is

645
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:18,000
boom take that right there and either

646
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,440
you know just pull that up through or or

647
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,398
what not but yeah i don't i don't lose

648
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,759
anything

649
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,479
i always i always you know lollipop

650
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,200
right up to

651
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,159
right up to the lobster trap wire just

652
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,960
for that reason

653
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,519
uh the first time i used lobster trap

654
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,200
wire

655
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:40,798
i actually i made that mistake there's a

656
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:46,000
person named northern scrogger

657
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:48,480
uh that does scrog and he

658
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,759
i don't know he does it a lot

659
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,360
differently than i do it

660
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:56,558
um he keeps the flowers like

661
00:31:53,359 --> 00:32:00,000
like this high above

662
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:04,079
his trellis screen and they seem to be

663
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,200
underneath as well so

664
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,839
you know that's why uh i have that

665
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:15,840
secondary trellis

666
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:15,839
and really once i get to know a cultivar

667
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,440
you know like i wouldn't need that

668
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,678
secondary trellis with a bed

669
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,640
full of the cherry pie because it only

670
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,360
stretches that much

671
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,000
if i were to when i run the bruce banner

672
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,519
again i

673
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,038
know that i have two weeks of flower

674
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,440
that i can still bend um

675
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,200
or at least 10 days that i can still

676
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,960
bend where things are gonna

677
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,440
continue to stretch and grow vertical

678
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,558
so lesson learned you know i see you

679
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,320
saying

680
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,079
there that possibly it might be too much

681
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,798
light now what i believe the problem is

682
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,079
is that

683
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,519
there is no led or supplemental indoor

684
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,359
lighting or any lighting

685
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,200
for that matter that can be the correct

686
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,439
spectrum to the plant so

687
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,278
what you're actually seeing there is

688
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,120
missing spectrum that's causing that

689
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,640
plant to show that structure

690
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,479
so when you take it to your friend's

691
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,440
house if he has a whole different set of

692
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,679
lights

693
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,278
with a better spectrum or a different

694
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,399
spectrum not a better one but one that

695
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:15,919
might have uh

696
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,439
stuff that they can add that you're

697
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,720
missing it's going to show a totally

698
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,919
different structure on that plant

699
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,558
without bruce banner

700
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,399
mine outside look different than yours

701
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,319
your plant came from my mom

702
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,439
my not crowning out as bad as yours and

703
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,480
my buds are actually

704
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,679
a lot larger and i'm using the sun along

705
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,399
with a

706
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,600
250 watt viper spectra just to add light

707
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:38,319
to the back corners

708
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,759
where the sun can't actually reach and

709
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,240
i'm getting the same stretch that you're

710
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,919
getting

711
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,839
but i don't have the color you have even

712
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,000
though that bruce banner's lighter

713
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,879
she's just a heavier feeding girl is

714
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,200
what it is so

715
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,039
because i knew that i upped the amount

716
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,640
of nutrients in the area that i was

717
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,480
going to put her in

718
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,919
so that she has access to a little bit

719
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,278
more nutrients in there she's going to

720
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,799
want to eat more

721
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,960
nitrogen earlier she needs more

722
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,319
phosphorus earlier and then as she goes

723
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,640
into flour she's going to need more

724
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,240
magnesium potassium and calcium

725
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,000
and all those if they don't build up in

726
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,039
the tissue during veg

727
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
you're going to have issues where

728
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,759
they're showing very lightly in flour

729
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,519
that's just how that plant reacts the

730
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,679
cherry pie is going to act differently

731
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,320
she doesn't feed as hard so she's

732
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,039
looking greener in that garden because

733
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,559
you've got her nutrient levels met so

734
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,480
that what's happening is the bruce

735
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,519
banner is just starving is all it is she

736
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,280
just wants to be

737
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,960
fed more but if you feed that cherry pie

738
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,480
like the bruce you're going to get the

739
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,480
morphines off that cherry pie

740
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,199
isn't that crazy man how those two

741
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,280
plants on

742
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,279
and then one in the middle it just shows

743
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,480
you like

744
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,399
genetics like crazy like

745
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,398
like you never know you know what i mean

746
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,039
i mean maybe some people know maybe you

747
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,039
know but

748
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:57,279
as a as a as a simple home grower

749
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,400
i don't i don't know you know what i

750
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
mean

751
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,760
i mean the only reason i knew he did

752
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
that like i said i've been i spent too

753
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,520
much

754
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,039
time growing plants and that's all i

755
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,759
know like i don't know [ __ ] about

756
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,838
lobster fishing none of that [ __ ] right

757
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,040
but i can tell you about cannabis plants

758
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,719
and i can tell you about the ones that

759
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,159
i've got experience with i won't try to

760
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,358
chime in all the time with [ __ ] i've

761
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,279
never [ __ ] with

762
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,559
but if i've grown that like my fire lg

763
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,040
outside i've had that plant for

764
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,719
15 years i know exactly what it grows

765
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,279
like i know the patterns it's gonna go

766
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,879
through

767
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,800
i know when it's gonna flower when it's

768
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,838
gonna finish when you need to pollinate

769
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,039
that plant

770
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:33,279
those are all things that are basic

771
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,039
botanical science with the plant but you

772
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,640
only learn through experience

773
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,559
or paying the [ __ ] attention to other

774
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,078
people that have had an experience

775
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:41,679
and that's what i that's what i was

776
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,880
saying like as i

777
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:46,960
as i grow this bruce banner

778
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,400
multiple times i'm gonna learn more

779
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,679
about it and how it

780
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,480
how it and what it likes in my

781
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,078
environment you know

782
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,358
yeah she's a heavy theater it comes

783
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,000
through the both the sour diesel and the

784
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:00,719
og side

785
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,639
but it's also got an issue where if you

786
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,598
push too hard with the nitrogen

787
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,480
like it uh transition that can give you

788
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,320
issues

789
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,838
that's why i'm always telling people not

790
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,320
to top dress a lot of uh

791
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,838
amino acids right at the switch with

792
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,280
certain plants because you can cause

793
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,358
like that cherry pie

794
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,920
if you dump a bunch of fish hydrophilic

795
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,078
or soy proteins on that plant right a

796
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,358
transition you will get amorphous on the

797
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,119
bottom of the plant

798
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,639
and that's just going to be a

799
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,880
phenotypical expression

800
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,920
of the environment that you put it into

801
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,720
it doesn't mean that plants are

802
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,960
homophobic

803
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,879
that when a plant's a morphodi it always

804
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,358
produces

805
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,320
traits on a specific time and on a

806
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,880
specific date

807
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,640
every grow it isn't going to change

808
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,599
pomophiles are going to show up on day

809
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,598
15 or maybe it's day 27 whatever it is

810
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,760
if you know that plant does that and it

811
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,880
does do it it will do it every time

812
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,079
a plant that changes uh through uh

813
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,760
inputs is just a endogenous hormone

814
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,359
stress indicator it's telling you

815
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,200
something in that room

816
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,799
isn't happy with that and you can see

817
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,759
that with the uh

818
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,160
bob's cheddar can when you can see that

819
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,920
four of the plants out of the six are

820
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,440
responding better to the environment

821
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,559
than the other two

822
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,159
and then you can go over to the other

823
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,000
two and see the mother to the two that

824
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:16,879
aren't responding well is also having

825
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,280
issues

826
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,800
with some of the soil because it's also

827
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,000
growing lighter in color

828
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,359
and you know what i'm talking about it's

829
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,320
having issues with the crowning of the

830
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,319
flowers

831
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,440
this is a way for you to see that that

832
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,559
environmental issues

833
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,440
are causation on genetics and not just

834
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:33,519
one point like

835
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,039
that bruce banner is passing something

836
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,159
over to the progeny

837
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,159
that can affect them phenotypically not

838
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,759
on a genotype level the genes stay the

839
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,279
same and every seed's a different

840
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,040
genotype but that phenotypical

841
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,000
expression of the genotype makeup of

842
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,000
that plant

843
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,039
is being swayed by the same traits from

844
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
the parent line

845
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,279
to the progeny so it's easy to see when

846
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,358
you have both the plants and that's

847
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,440
that's a jump start to me given

848
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,400
not just you but anyone i offered like a

849
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,480
parent plant to

850
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,838
and the progeny it's a way for them to

851
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,199
see those types of things when you can

852
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,279
go over to the other tent in the same

853
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:06,719
area that's got the same soil mixture

854
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,760
and the same type of influence of the

855
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,519
same grower

856
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,359
and notice the same stresses that are

857
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,039
hitting both of them

858
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,239
you you start to realize these kind of

859
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,920
things now you can look at almost

860
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,479
anything that's crossed to a

861
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,280
blue spanner number three and possibly

862
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,358
the og

863
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,400
or the strawberry diesel unit and

864
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,078
recognize

865
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
some of those issues in some of the

866
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,359
plants that it's not even physically

867
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,079
related to other than

868
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,279
a grandparent right and that's from

869
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,920
growing two plants

870
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,880
that are related the mom and the progeny

871
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,960
but grew on those

872
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,800
that gives you a real good idea of what

873
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,440
could come out of that bruce banner line

874
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,920
it's like having a butt chin you know

875
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,639
some

876
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,240
like the butt chins come out like every

877
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,118
couple generations sometimes

878
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:49,598
yeah something like that it's

879
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,280
competitive it's an anatomic

880
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,440
trait it's called atavism when a trait

881
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,400
from a past generation shows up in this

882
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,679
generation

883
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,760
and it wasn't from the parental

884
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,919
generation it's called atovism

885
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,760
so it's a trait that can show up at any

886
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,920
time too it doesn't mean it shows up

887
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,680
on that seed on the first grow you might

888
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,559
take 10 grows before it shows up on that

889
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,319
seed

890
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,159
it might take a build up and swaying

891
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,119
that endogenous hormone that's causing

892
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:13,199
it to happen

893
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,039
or the set of traits that are dictating

894
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,118
it to be swayed

895
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,960
through uh epigenetics before it

896
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,240
actually starts to show as part of that

897
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,760
plant system

898
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:26,719
isn't that crazy so so then

899
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,079
if you were to breed something would you

900
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:31,279
would you breed it out

901
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,519
that far to do

902
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,280
yeah i know like if you had a question

903
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,920
about it i mean i know you would have to

904
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,119
but

905
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,039
if you saw that's what i think my space

906
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,720
cushion angel line i have i've read that

907
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,039
to a back cross seven

908
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,639
to the male i've reversed the male and

909
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,679
i've reversed the females

910
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,759
i've done f twos and threes at fours

911
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,358
for that one that's how i know my line's

912
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,320
bulletproof it's not just me saying it's

913
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,920
bulletproof

914
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,320
i can tell you that because of like i

915
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,440
said out of probably a million seeds

916
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,680
i've made with angel

917
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,119
i've had 10 people call me back and say

918
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,759
they have morphed

919
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,160
now a 10 out of a million means those 10

920
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,560
people

921
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,078
had issues in their garden it wasn't my

922
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,480
ass who made those seeds or i would have

923
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,519
had 900 000 hemorphides i wouldn't have

924
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,599
had denim

925
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,358
right so that's when it starts coming

926
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,000
into understanding

927
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:21,838
endogenous hormone stress where a lot of

928
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,719
growers don't even understand it or

929
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,279
notice it

930
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,358
you started to see it on the spacecraft

931
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,880
or this uh the bob's cheddar room

932
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,960
when you started seeing the new leaf

933
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,599
growth that's a hormone-driven leaf

934
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,280
growth

935
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,039
it's not coming from photosynthesis

936
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,640
that's coming from a sway

937
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,719
of auxins and ethylene and abscisic acid

938
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,879
that's in that plant when those levels

939
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,239
let's say the ratio was a step like one

940
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,800
two and three down right

941
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,318
yep if the top step starts to lower down

942
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,200
to where it's even with the second or

943
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,039
third step

944
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,480
you have swayed the amount of hormones

945
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,719
in that plant where it's going to have

946
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,800
an

947
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,759
absolutely different phenotypical

948
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,160
expression

949
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,920
in that garden we don't know what caused

950
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,239
it it could have been too much heat

951
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,680
in your case we know it was from the

952
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:07,838
timer being switched

953
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,838
over and having too much

954
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,679
the things that are going to affect the

955
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,800
actual structure and shape of that plant

956
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:29,199
through endogenous hormone levels and

957
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,800
you have no causation on it so when

958
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,078
people when i tell someone that

959
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,920
like what happened in your garden and

960
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,519
i'm just trying to find that info a lot

961
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,639
of people think that is me saying they

962
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,480
[ __ ] the garden up

963
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,480
but that's not that's not at all what

964
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,838
happened like i was sitting here on this

965
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,960
video watching you

966
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:47,039
when your light started going and i was

967
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,960
did i get mad was i pissed that you're

968
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,759
testing my [ __ ] with a bad like no this

969
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,679
is all part of

970
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,480
this could happen in any garden in any

971
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,318
room and this is my way of proving

972
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,240
what i keep telling everyone that

973
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:00,480
there's no way for me to breed out

974
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,399
what you could have happen in your room

975
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,760
doesn't mean you caused it it means it

976
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,680
happened in your room

977
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,119
your environment and your area it's got

978
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:10,000
a different temperature a different

979
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,880
vapor deficit it's got a different uh

980
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,800
your different elevation everything is

981
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,880
different there's no way for me to breed

982
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,880
at

983
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,800
so when people say that the breeder

984
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,440
didn't do any work

985
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,519
to stabilize a line i've been i've been

986
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,200
spending 20 years trying to do that work

987
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,159
by teaching the growers that are growing

988
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,399
my lines

989
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:34,078
it ain't mean dude and it ain't you it's

990
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,280
a nature that has made this plant do

991
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,800
what it's doing

992
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,160
and all you got to do is either take a

993
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,440
cut and do what you want to do and take

994
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,879
it over to your friend's house and grow

995
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,559
it under a different light

996
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,960
with different inputs to see if what's

997
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,799
happening is was you

998
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,119
maybe what you did in the garden

999
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,480
affected it was it the light that [ __ ]

1000
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,000
up which you couldn't

1001
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,000
do but change all you can do is change

1002
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,960
the light so it's not you but you could

1003
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,280
change it

1004
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,960
or is it just that plant just [ __ ]

1005
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,000
being a piece of [ __ ] right some plants

1006
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,679
are pieces of [ __ ]

1007
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,440
there's many options that could cause

1008
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,440
what's happening to happen

1009
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,200
and if bless your smart enough cat to go

1010
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,880
i want to know what's happening but when

1011
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,879
oh you're a sucker [ __ ]

1012
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,319
you know so it could have been anything

1013
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,000
but

1014
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:17,279
you didn't get mad you just dealt with

1015
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,239
it went along with it that's what you're

1016
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,760
supposed to do

1017
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,118
too many growers get picked and

1018
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,640
automatically hit up the breeder and

1019
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,960
tell them they [ __ ] up

1020
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,960
and [ __ ] you plants a piece

1021
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:41,440
you know what i mean like that's i mean

1022
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,838
i didn't know what to expect getting

1023
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,800
testers you know you never do

1024
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:48,239
so it's like that's what testing is like

1025
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,480
if i send them out like the testers

1026
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,039
aren't

1027
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,679
looking to be [ __ ] with these things

1028
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,079
super

1029
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,279
[ __ ] hard i put them through some

1030
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,160
[ __ ]

1031
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,160
and they came out pretty [ __ ] good

1032
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:02,719
for the hard time i put them through

1033
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,318
and so if they had not gone through

1034
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,799
those stressors

1035
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,960
imagine what they would have ended up

1036
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,480
like otherwise they'd be better yeah you

1037
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,318
know better

1038
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,559
yeah and so it just goes to show that

1039
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,559
like

1040
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,560
[ __ ] your gear is [ __ ] awesome

1041
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,519
and a lot of people have brewed with

1042
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:28,159
bruce banner

1043
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,920
and a lot of people have gotten bad

1044
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:31,039
cruises from brewfinder because of the

1045
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,200
mail they put on it

1046
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,039
right when it paired up to that plant it

1047
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,039
either made

1048
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,079
some bad traits that he popped out of it

1049
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:39,519
so the plants were throwing

1050
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,440
more bites as soon as they went in the

1051
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,838
flower uh or

1052
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,519
the plant cooking stretched way too far

1053
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:46,799
one [ __ ] kind of handled up and like

1054
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,079
all of them were too lame he couldn't

1055
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,680
hold himself up

1056
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,519
what you've seen is my choice through my

1057
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,399
space cheese mail

1058
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,039
which is related to my angel mail my own

1059
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,639
work

1060
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,318
it's not some other dude smith that i

1061
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,159
read about i'm using [ __ ] that i knew

1062
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,759
about i can tell you before you even

1063
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:02,480
grow that plant what might happen to the

1064
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,079
plant if you'd

1065
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,760
asked i could have told you you're going

1066
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,880
to get a majority of shorter plants out

1067
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,560
of the cross

1068
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,079
you're going to get stabilized plants

1069
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,239
because i'd cross that plant to plants

1070
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,119
that hermorphadite like a [ __ ]

1071
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,439
and the crosses will not throw nuts i've

1072
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,920
tried to reverse my space push line

1073
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,119
and i've done that for you it doesn't

1074
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,119
like to be reversed

1075
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:28,079
i got a question for you does

1076
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,760
have you ever come across a situation

1077
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,519
where

1078
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:37,040
like a female just will not

1079
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:40,239
take a certain male pollen or

1080
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:43,279
like a certain male pollen always

1081
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,799
[ __ ] up a certain cultivar female or

1082
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,839
something like that like

1083
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:51,280
like they they just will not

1084
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:54,000
make something like space to the space

1085
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,000
chief females will not accept mama

1086
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,599
they don't like boom but i see if i can

1087
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,838
find the jar i got a jar here that has

1088
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,838
all the seeds i've made in five crops

1089
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,680
i think i might have got a hundred seeds

1090
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,838
out of five pollinations off of space

1091
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:11,279
cheese in the last year

1092
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:14,318
that's it probably seven plants that's

1093
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,079
that's not very many

1094
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:17,599
i get like ten thousand seeds off of a

1095
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,318
plant when they're pollinated like

1096
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,680
the space cheese male that pollinated

1097
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:23,679
triangle kush

1098
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,159
i probably got ten thousand seeds off of

1099
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,480
plant the three foot space cheese plant

1100
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:31,199
next to it gave me 40 seeds

1101
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,920
40 seeds the mac one gave me more

1102
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,159
cinnamon

1103
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,838
than the space cheese gave me mac one

1104
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,598
pollinated easier than space cheese and

1105
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,358
mac one won't pollinate that plant does

1106
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,119
not like getting pollinated

1107
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,279
so there's an issue with pollen tubes

1108
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,160
actually forming in the pistol of the

1109
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,079
stigma

1110
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,559
when the stigma gets hit by a prone

1111
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,000
grain a pollen tube is formed that goes

1112
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,838
all the way down to the ovary

1113
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,679
which allows gestation to happen if that

1114
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:54,639
thing gets distorted in any way or

1115
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:56,559
doesn't make it

1116
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:57,920
you don't get seeds and that's what's

1117
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:02,719
happening so then

1118
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:05,920
that can can that be specifically bred

1119
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:09,358
into a line so that

1120
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,159
it can be it can but it takes work

1121
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:13,519
right right you can bring sterility into

1122
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,118
a line

1123
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,440
you can you can make a whole brand new

1124
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,838
f1 that will not accept pollen you can

1125
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,318
do that

1126
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,519
it's not easy without genetic sequencing

1127
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:25,440
but you can do it

1128
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,199
i mean that's what that that's why they

1129
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,039
started trying to [ __ ] with uh

1130
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,279
them seeds to begin with their whole

1131
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,558
plan was to try to offer a plant

1132
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,480
that they didn't think was going to be

1133
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,079
able to accept pollen from a male and it

1134
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,400
didn't end up working that way

1135
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,720
so they started making more influence

1136
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,440
and making s twos and that's threes

1137
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:44,959
because the farther you inbreed that way

1138
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,119
the more likely you're going to cause

1139
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:51,119
that plant to become sterile

1140
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:54,240
it's part of it i asked james loud and

1141
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:57,680
peter the other day when he was on

1142
00:47:54,239 --> 00:48:01,598
about the state of

1143
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:03,838
fems and such going out in the

1144
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,800
in the industry whether it be

1145
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:10,639
recreational commercial home growers

1146
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:14,480
femmes seem to be making like a

1147
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:18,159
a dominant fight for the masses

1148
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,920
you know like no it's not

1149
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,440
it's not the feminizing the fact that

1150
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,039
everyone is uh

1151
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,480
breeding with plants that are highly

1152
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,000
related to each other it's part of

1153
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,599
inbreeding depression

1154
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,838
so like all these cookie crosses that

1155
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,160
keep getting crossed to each other

1156
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:34,000
not only are the good alleles combining

1157
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,838
but the bad receptive ones are also

1158
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,239
combining and becoming dominant traits

1159
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:39,759
now you can make a recessive homogenous

1160
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,919
trait become a

1161
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,200
dominant homogeneous trait you were

1162
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,240
saying that in the other

1163
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,078
way yeah and people don't get this so

1164
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:49,838
through breeding like if i pick a cookie

1165
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,200
car a cookie and cross it to my plant

1166
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:53,358
then i sell you the seed right you've

1167
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,118
got an f1 of my cookie cross

1168
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,440
now you get a cookie crop from another

1169
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,119
guy but the the other lines not even

1170
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,480
related to my line but they both have

1171
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,720
cookies

1172
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,679
so now you cross those two together you

1173
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:07,919
have effectively inbred a cookie flying

1174
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:10,639
from two poly hybrids so what's going to

1175
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,800
happen is in the f1 most of the

1176
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:13,759
good alleles are going to combine from

1177
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,280
the cookies

1178
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,359
not from the other clips because they're

1179
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,319
not related they don't have an allele to

1180
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:20,400
pair up to

1181
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,400
there's not a pair so the plant looks

1182
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,440
required to make coffee to pass that

1183
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,200
trade over

1184
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,280
because what's happening is you've got

1185
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:31,199
genes and you've got alleles

1186
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:34,720
genes are like blue eyes or

1187
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:38,000
a beard or long fingernails right

1188
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,879
and alleles are a different color eye

1189
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,920
or a different colored beard it's a form

1190
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,160
of a gene but an

1191
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,960
alternate gene so if you when they're

1192
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,480
trying to pair

1193
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,000
up to show you've got a beard you have

1194
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,760
to have two beards

1195
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,519
or if you want to have blue eyes you got

1196
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,240
to have both blue eyes

1197
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:54,960
so when you start to breed two plants

1198
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:56,479
like yeah

1199
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,159
with the cookie from here and a cookie

1200
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,920
from here what happens is all the good

1201
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,679
cooking [ __ ] starts to combine

1202
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,280
and starts to match up these alleles so

1203
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:04,159
that the plant that comes out has genes

1204
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,480
that are

1205
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,920
able to pass and burn in nature because

1206
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,599
all recessive plants

1207
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,358
in nature can't breed together like if

1208
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,240
everything was recessive they're gonna

1209
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:14,639
die out

1210
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,318
that's the problem so what happens is

1211
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:17,838
you start the inbreed now you take your

1212
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:18,318
brand new cross and send it to another

1213
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:20,000
dude

1214
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:21,358
and he's got a cross that's got cookies

1215
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,079
and in his mind he thinks

1216
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:25,119
i'm gonna make cookies he's gonna do it

1217
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,119
making

1218
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,760
a bad version of cookies the more you

1219
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,280
start to inbreed a cookie line from

1220
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,280
something that doesn't use the same

1221
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,040
reoccurring parent as long as if you

1222
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,440
just keep pollinating that open gene

1223
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,639
pool my mom

1224
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,720
what happens is you're going to start

1225
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:41,440
pulling in all the bad [ __ ] as well as

1226
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:43,279
the good [ __ ]

1227
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,960
and if you don't know how to select or

1228
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,920
you don't grow enough plants to do your

1229
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,519
selection

1230
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,280
yeah you're more than likely gonna pull

1231
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,679
out the batshit because

1232
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,920
all you're after is smell and high and

1233
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,039
that plant's got 62 000 other traits it

1234
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,480
needs to pass out

1235
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,558
and you're not paying attention to none

1236
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,000
of them except for i wanted to finish in

1237
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,519
eight weeks and i wanted to look like

1238
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,719
cookies and i want to smell it that's

1239
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:04,960
three traits

1240
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,239
that you're trying to breed for that may

1241
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,039
or may not carry

1242
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,318
50 or 60 bad traits with him because

1243
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:13,039
then you don't even know that because

1244
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:14,480
you didn't pop enough seats

1245
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,880
that's what i was saying about you

1246
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,079
before you came on tony i was like

1247
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:23,440
this is what tony does he breeds for

1248
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:26,880
but he breeds for certain issues

1249
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:31,039
he doesn't breed for just bag appeal

1250
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,119
and weight you know he he goes

1251
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,358
it's deeper than that for him you know

1252
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,400
each of his lines has been bred

1253
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,960
for a specific reason a specific

1254
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,240
illness for someone he cared about you

1255
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,920
know

1256
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,639
and that takes a lot of [ __ ] work and

1257
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,639
a lot of time

1258
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,960
looking like a dj now oh 144 northern

1259
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,960
crosses

1260
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,720
from angel were all done for medicinal

1261
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,838
purposes and i was able to do that

1262
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,118
because i worked at a club with 4 600

1263
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:07,599
patients ain't no average breeder going

1264
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,440
to be able to breed 144 lines

1265
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,838
and all of them be used for medicinal

1266
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,838
purposes by himself

1267
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:15,519
it ain't happening man that's the whole

1268
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:16,719
thing with what's going on here we got

1269
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:18,800
all these people out there telling you

1270
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,558
doing all this work and they've got 170

1271
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,000
crosses that they release

1272
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,920
and you ain't seeing the parents to

1273
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,719
either one of them and you haven't seen

1274
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,480
the uh

1275
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,159
you haven't seen [ __ ] off of them and

1276
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,000
they're just live

1277
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:36,480
i noticed a lot of places no names but

1278
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,199
a lot of places fire off like

1279
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,599
25 different cultivars that have all

1280
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:43,039
been

1281
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:47,838
crossed with the same male and it's

1282
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,838
it's it just it's

1283
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:53,519
it makes me it doesn't give me a good

1284
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,280
thought process it doesn't make me feel

1285
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:59,519
secure

1286
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,880
and i got a shitload of space cheese

1287
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,800
crosses i could be dropping on

1288
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,318
everybody but i let my [ __ ] go through

1289
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,599
testing dude

1290
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,000
i ain't one of these buster ass

1291
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,680
[ __ ] that because i got 112 new

1292
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,079
crosses that i could drop

1293
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,399
doesn't mean i am dropping i make 112

1294
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,000
crosses so that 12 of them come out nice

1295
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,358
i start popping all the seeds out of

1296
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,639
there and find out i don't like what's

1297
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:19,920
coming out of that cross

1298
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:21,679
i don't like what's coming out of that

1299
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,519
cross but everything right here

1300
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,598
this shit's [ __ ] killer right right i

1301
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:26,159
would smoke it every day so i let it go

1302
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,599
out

1303
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,358
and if people don't like it that's on

1304
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,559
them because i'm not breeding for other

1305
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:32,239
[ __ ] these days

1306
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,119
i breed for me but back in the day all

1307
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:36,719
i've read for was other sick people

1308
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,160
for real man i'd bring someone in they

1309
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,078
had some kind of cancer

1310
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:41,358
i'd find another 20 people in my club

1311
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,119
that had the same cancer

1312
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:44,400
i'd send them all out a cut of a certain

1313
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,160
plant that i thought would work and then

1314
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,240
give them crosses of the same

1315
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:49,838
plant to my angel to find out if my

1316
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:51,199
angel was passing what i needed in that

1317
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:52,960
cross and they'd all come back and be

1318
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:54,558
like your cross sucked ass and i was

1319
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,240
like throw it in the can dude

1320
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,839
i'm not giving that [ __ ] out to nobody

1321
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:58,719
or they're like bro what the [ __ ] did

1322
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:00,639
you give me

1323
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:02,318
like my seizure stopped that's what

1324
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:04,318
happened with angel i started giving it

1325
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:06,558
out to veterans who were having seizures

1326
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,639
from traumatic brain injuries which is

1327
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,040

1343
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,559
9 out of ten seizure patients and they

1344
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,318
weren't going to have caesar's

1345
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,280
anywhere close to like i had someone go

1346
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:47,759

1347
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,440

1348
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,480
[ __ ] seeds i had another lady that i

1349
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,280

1350
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,559
uh cindy's angel too it's a cindy 99

1351
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,160
across the angel it's named for my

1352
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,640
buddy's mom who died

1353
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,358
i sent her some seeds the lady is 72

1354
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:00,639
years old

1355
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,960
she hadn't had her driver's license

1356
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:05,920
since she was 16.

1357
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,440
she smoked my line for one year she

1358
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,358
didn't have a seizure again

1359
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,119
they gave her license back she [ __ ]

1360
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,078
the first time she drove

1361
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,000
since she was 16 she's 72 years old now

1362
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,160
she can drive her [ __ ] self around

1363
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,199
all because i center a line that i put

1364
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,039
work into

1365
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,118
for that specific reason right i didn't

1366
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,159
charge her for them i just told her try

1367
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,160
them out

1368
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,679
they work for other people they may or

1369
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:29,440
may not work for she never hit me back

1370
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:32,000
for a year so i thought they didn't work

1371
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,440
and one day she hits me up and she sent

1372
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,838
me if i don't know if you can see them

1373
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,519
but there's some orange jars right there

1374
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:39,440
she sent me these hand-etched jars with

1375
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,960
seeds inside of them to thank me

1376
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,200
for getting rid of her seizures and i

1377
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,000
had totally forgot about the lady right

1378
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:47,279
and i met her through the the pfa i met

1379
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,559
a lot of cool people in that group even

1380
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,440
though the group was a hunk of [ __ ] at

1381
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,440
the end

1382
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,960
but i met so many cool people in there

1383
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,559
that didn't know why they were they were

1384
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,240
in that group to save their own lives

1385
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,599
and it was because they met people like

1386
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,000
myself and others

1387
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,680
who weren't selling them [ __ ] they

1388
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,679
were selling them science

1389
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:05,279
they were selling them experience they

1390
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:07,358
weren't i wasn't giving them my opinion

1391
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,880
on [ __ ] i was giving them my experience

1392
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,960
with facts through other people

1393
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,720

1407
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,599
about

1408
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:42,318
i yeah you know it's you know

1409

i i appreciate the way you approach

1410
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:46,159
things

1411
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,280
and something that i not for you but i

1412
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,399
don't appreciate

1413
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,040
about breeders is the constant

1414
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,760
the constant output of all of these

1415
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,039
different

1416
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:59,440
cultivars like you know like

1417
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,880
like they got to get paid man like well

1418
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,679
i know but like i'll say like

1419
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,119
in-house like i have a big problem with

1420
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:09,039
in-house and ethos

1421
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:10,960
ethos like always having new things come

1422
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,960
out like every month it

1423
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,559
they're just something yeah but why why

1424
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,318
be mad at that breeder for doing that

1425
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,359
when the real problem is

1426
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:19,838
all the people buying that i'm sorry i

1427
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:21,920

1428
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:23,838
i i understand what you're saying i know

1429
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,318
what you i know what you mean

1430
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:28,239

1431
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,920
people that are coming into this thing

1432

1433
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,760
track record to prove any of those lines

1434
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:34,960
do anything except for fit in the box

1435
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,440

1446
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,559

1460
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,440
listening to the crap and you keep

1461
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,000
buying it someone put skunk on a pack

1462
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,159
and you buy

1463
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,318
it someone puts og on a pack and you buy

1464
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,399
it you don't ask to see the parents

1465
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:30,798
you don't ask to see a test grow you

1466
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,880
don't ask to have anybody besides the

1467
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,719
breeder tell you that [ __ ] was bomb

1468
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,318
right you don't ask any questions that

1469
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,439
could keep you from getting ripped off

1470
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:38,798
other than where do i get them for the

1471
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,720
cheapest [ __ ] price

1472
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:42,480
that's that's the best question everyone

1473
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:44,639
asks when it comes to cannabis seeds

1474
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,159
and for a decade i had the cheapest

1475
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:47,118
seeds in the cannabis industry and i

1476
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:48,798
couldn't

1477
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,079
offer them to you unless i put them in a

1478
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:50,559
package for cheaper than they were

1479
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,920
already

1480
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,680
in there and then people asked me to

1481
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,920
give them a discount then and i was like

1482
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:57,679
[ __ ] you go spend a thousand on some

1483
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,880
jackasses packs and then call me back

1484
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:01,358
when you want something stable

1485
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,760
you can't right 10 or 15 pack of seeds

1486
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:06,078
for the prices you charge

1487
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,359
no only a couple people man pistol

1488
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,039
positive hasn't

1489
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:10,719
my buddy pistol positive is the only guy

1490
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,079
i know that every one of his packs is

1491
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,159
practiced just like mine

1492
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,480
he's not trying to rip you off he's

1493
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,318
trying to give you what he's proud of

1494
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,798
for a price that he thinks they should

1495
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:22,639
be worth and that's it right it's up to

1496
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:24,079
you to put the value on them i mean it's

1497
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:24,558
30 bucks what's that going to cost

1498
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,318
anymore

1499
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,400
it costs that much to send a box with

1500
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:29,679
some cuts in it i just did that [ __ ]

1501
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,358
today 25

1502
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:32,960
to put [ __ ] 10 cuts that are fully

1503
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:33,440
rooted in a box and send them the [ __ ]

1504
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,199
out

1505
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,679
or you could buy one 10 pack of seeds

1506
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,199
for 30 bucks and have endless clones for

1507
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:40,639
the rest of your life if you just listen

1508
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:42,318
to my feed when i tell you how to clone

1509
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,558
the plant i just gave you

1510
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,239
and i used to sell you one pack for 30

1511
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,200
and give you another pay for free so you

1512
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:48,719
paid 15

1513
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:50,960
for my pack of seeds because you got two

1514
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,639
packs right and people still bitching

1515
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,079
because it didn't have a name that they

1516
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:55,519
recognized or

1517
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,200
they didn't know who i was and that

1518
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,400
wasn't my fault the reason you don't

1519
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,639
know who i am is

1520
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,760
because i'm not out there that's just it

1521
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,838
right one day

1522
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,880
you run across me ask me some questions

1523
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:06,318
i'm not hiding

1524
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,240
it does just because you don't mow me

1525
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:10,400
doesn't mean [ __ ] like we all

1526
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:11,358
didn't know the next person we meet like

1527
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,680
i never knew you

1528
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:15,679
exactly i didn't know you from [ __ ] and

1529
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:18,558
then we interacted online

1530
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:20,399
and became friends exactly yeah but like

1531
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,400
if you'd have been a punk ass [ __ ]

1532
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,240
that was just full of [ __ ] all the time

1533
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,559
i wouldn't have been around you could be

1534
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:28,078
you can be a sarcastic [ __ ] i'm the

1535
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,839
same dude but if you were full of [ __ ]

1536
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,079
with what the info you were saying

1537
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:33,838
i wouldn't be here talking to you i

1538
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:35,680
wouldn't have sold you no seeds

1539
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,199
none of that [ __ ] i'd just been like i

1540
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:38,558
wouldn't answer the [ __ ] question i'd

1541
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:42,000
do that all day

1542
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,200
but like we'd interacted beyond offering

1543
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,960
seeds to some like before

1544
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:46,318
you bought any seeds from me you'd

1545
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,000
already decided if i was worth

1546
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:49,119
[ __ ] talking to you know what i mean

1547
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,318
you didn't just hit me up and go let me

1548
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,280
buy those seeds because someone else

1549
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:54,400
said buy them

1550
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,119
i bought them because my attitude made

1551
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,318
what i was offering worth a try that

1552
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,680
wasn't the other way around like he

1553
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:01,119
didn't buy my seeds grow him and go

1554
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:02,558
maybe i'll talk to that dude you had to

1555
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,160
talk to me to get him

1556
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,760
right because my seeds weren't available

1557
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:08,318
at no [ __ ] club before and

1558
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,160
no [ __ ] distributor and they weren't

1559
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,318
hyped up you know i didn't know anyone

1560
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:14,558
that was growing boneyard seeds

1561
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:15,440
you know i had just seen you and the the

1562
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,519
pfa

1563
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,960
talking about breeding offered

1564
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,119
interesting stuff and

1565
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,720
you know i think that's where we first

1566
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,519
interacted

1567
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:26,000
and uh i've been in there since 2011. i

1568
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,000
was

1569
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,239
i was the 11th person they asked to join

1570
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,838
that group i was hit up by alan

1571
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:36,078
and gage green in emails asked me

1572
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:37,119
to be in the group because i had shared

1573
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,880
more information

1574
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,039
publicly than any other grower that they

1575
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,160
had met so they wanted to know if i

1576
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:43,358
could do that in the group

1577
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,358
and that's what i know that's why i got

1578
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:49,199
here you were you were

1579
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:52,318
always posting like science

1580
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:55,919
based information on

1581
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:59,358
cannabis plant biology soil

1582
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,119
biology pathogens fungus

1583
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,199
you were you were and it may not be

1584
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,640
everybody's boat right like you like me

1585
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:06,558
and you don't think the same way about

1586
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:08,480
growing to this tea but like i brought

1587
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,960
up on your feet earlier

1588
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,880
it's science like your room [ __ ] up

1589
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,119
and what was happening was

1590
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,160
science and biology there was no way to

1591
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,760
think about that of

1592
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:19,199
any other way you could have sat there

1593
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,079
and ignored it and it was still going to

1594
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:21,358
happen

1595
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,798
you could have pretended it wasn't

1596
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:23,920
happening and it was still going to

1597
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:25,759
[ __ ] happen

1598
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,519
you could have ignored that it actually

1599
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,039
happened on the live feed but me and

1600
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:30,239
other people were watching and the [ __ ]

1601
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,920
happened right

1602
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:34,000
that's what science is all about right

1603
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,400
science is the fact that you and i both

1604
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,358
can look at something come up with a

1605
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,519
reasoning for what

1606
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:41,358
happened and still want to find out if

1607
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:42,159
there was more right that's what science

1608
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,159
is about

1609
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:46,078
right science is never giving you a hard

1610
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:48,239
answer other than there's more to learn

1611
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,160
there's always always that's that's what

1612
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:52,399
science is that's what science is

1613
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,519
there's always more and you know what's

1614
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,240
funny is i

1615
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,440
i was just listening to something i

1616
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,558
remember what it was but they were

1617
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,318
saying like

1618
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,240
[ __ ] scientists are kind of [ __ ]

1619
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,119
us up with that science [ __ ] you know

1620
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:06,000
like [ __ ]

1621
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,200
with it always wanting more you know

1622
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,440
they're like

1623
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,480
like do any of the scientists ever go

1624
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,760
like you know

1625
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:16,880
maybe making a ryerson

1626
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:19,039
bomb out of whatever

1627
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,880
in fact scientists yeah they are who did

1628
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,079
that brother like no i know look back in

1629
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,400
here

1630
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,440
like the dude that invented the [ __ ]

1631
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,000
atom bomb went

1632
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,679
um we shouldn't be doing this [ __ ] and

1633
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,599
they went and took it from his ass and

1634
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:33,679
[ __ ] blew people up with it right

1635
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,680
when he realized what he was doing he

1636
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,118
was like oh [ __ ] we [ __ ] up

1637
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,879
and he went and told someone he thought

1638
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,640
would listen and they were like

1639
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,400
you're fired [ __ ] someone else is

1640
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:43,838
finishing the job right because humans

1641
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,559
don't give a [ __ ] about nothing but

1642
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:46,719
their self

1643
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,240
yeah that's that's the whole [ __ ]

1644
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:50,159
thing it's scary

1645
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:52,000
that's what's wrong that's what's wrong

1646
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,639
with us and then we all know a dude like

1647
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,639
that we

1648
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,639
we all have an in-law like that we all

1649
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:59,038
know some [ __ ]

1650
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,639
that needs to have his ass drilled into

1651
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,359
the ground until he's the one that needs

1652
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:02,960
the help

1653
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:04,960
and then has to ask for it like me with

1654

1659
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,839
i used to i wouldn't ask you for [ __ ]

1660
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:15,199
help if i was the only thing i'd asked

1661
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:16,960
you for help was to help me save my

1662
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:17,759
mom's life or my dad's life and that's

1663
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,358
it

1664
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,039
i wasn't going to ask you to help me do

1665
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:22,558
[ __ ] not go get gas

1666
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,400
not [ __ ] help me [ __ ] get

1667
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,359
directions nothing

1668
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,400
being being a certain amount of

1669
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,598
vulnerable

1670
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:35,358
is actually a great human

1671
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:36,798
quality yeah but you have to be able to

1672
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:38,480
recognize the vulnerability that's the

1673
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:39,199
problem most of us think we're [ __ ]

1674
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,358
uh

1675
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,239
we're we can't be you know we're

1676
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:43,920
involved we can't

1677
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,358
we can't be killed most of us feel that

1678
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,159
all the time but we'll say it in

1679
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:48,400
everybody's post

1680
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:50,078
right we'll see someone that's just

1681
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,599
showing a little bit of a

1682
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,119
vulnerability and on their post we're

1683
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,640
like [ __ ] you [ __ ] right and

1684
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,240
that automatically shows that you're a

1685
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:57,838
vulnerable [ __ ] but

1686
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:59,038
it also shows you're too stupid to admit

1687
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:00,400
it because as soon as you admit it the

1688
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,760
vulnerability is gone

1689
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,680
because someone else is gonna be like

1690
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,240
dude you need help like what's going on

1691
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:06,159
man

1692
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:08,318
we're all willing to help the next dude

1693
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:10,480
out except the [ __ ] that

1694
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:11,759
won't accept it and won't offer none

1695
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,318
that's the only dude we're all out there

1696
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,280
going dude

1697
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:17,199
[ __ ] you yeah go lose a leg [ __ ] yeah

1698
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,240
go lose a leg

1699
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:22,639
you know that'll teach him i'm serious

1700
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:24,399
hey tommy i i had a sex change and they

1701
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:28,000
did it by taking my leg off bro the

1702
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,000
[ __ ] was hiding behind my kneecap

1703
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:31,440
they took that [ __ ] right off my ass

1704
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:34,318
and turned me into a [ __ ]

1705
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,318
man with a spine like when i fell you

1706
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:37,519
know i wouldn't say before i fell i was

1707
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:39,920
necessarily

1708
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:41,038
uh the nicest person but i definitely

1709
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,480
had

1710
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:47,760
a different i would say more passive

1711
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:51,358
demeanor but after i fell and i came

1712
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,760
so close to what other people thought

1713
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,199
was

1714
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,119
death i i knew i wasn't gonna die

1715
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,399
but i i was somewhere else you know what

1716
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,200
i mean like i wasn't

1717
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,200
i was somewhere

1718
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:07,279
like when i came

1719
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,640
after i came through all of it you know

1720
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,000
and i'd healed up

1721
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:12,558
i was a different person i i realized

1722
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,838
how

1723
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,599
short things are and that i can't go

1724
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:22,000
through life

1725
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:25,039
holding back on important things

1726
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,400
you know i can't i can't be passive i

1727
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:31,440
can't

1728
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:35,119
i can't not something that's going wrong

1729
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:39,440
and not say something about it

1730
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:42,798
it's it's just and before my accident

1731
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,440
i was them that person that would see

1732
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:48,079
something and

1733
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:50,400
be like i didn't see it i didn't hear it

1734
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,559
you know like friends using the n-word

1735
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,680
or telling jokes about black people or

1736
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,960
yeah you know what i mean

1737
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:59,679
like like i wasn't

1738
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,119
i wasn't strong enough to stand up for

1739
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:03,919
my convictions whereas though

1740
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,400
after my accident boom it was like a

1741
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,880
[ __ ]

1742
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,880
switch

1743
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,838
are those the banners

1744
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,078
that's the banner yeah looks like that's

1745
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,440
the bruce banner

1746
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,920
and then i got a cherry pie in the

1747
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,440
middle and then this is a cory

1748
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,519
and that's a cory so let's see i'll

1749
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,679
stand up here um

1750
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:32,559
as you'll see i don't have the the

1751
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:35,440
yellowing that you have on

1752
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,519
but colored as you'll see this is a

1753
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,519
cherry pie right next to her

1754
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:40,719
this is uh this is a bruce banner leaf

1755
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:44,159
in my hand

1756
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:44,159
and a cherry pie right next to it

1757
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:50,480
now what's coming from the plants you're

1758
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:53,440
extremely hungry so i

1759
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,440
i'm probably chopping

1760
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,480
i'm sorry about that i'm outside here

1761
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,640
it's hard brother

1762
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,639
um

1763
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,879
what i was trying to show you was that

1764
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,920
the bruce banner and the cherry pie in

1765
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,599
my garden

1766
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,760
aren't losing any color like they're the

1767
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,760
exact same color and that's because i

1768
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,440
i knew that plant needed more food so i

1769
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,920
kicked up the amount of food so

1770
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,039
what you're seeing isn't actually from

1771
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,798
like too much light it's

1772
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:22,079
it's a combination of the spectrum being

1773
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,238
off and

1774
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,079
not enough food actually is what it is

1775
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,479
now what

1776
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:29,359
do you would you have any sense of what

1777
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:33,599
it might be

1778
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:35,600
missing as far as a spectrum

1779
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,199
on the spectrum um i don't know what

1780
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,719
your light is i'd have to check the

1781
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,719
spectrum on your light but

1782
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,079
um what i feel you're missing is you're

1783
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,198
missing some of the blue side of the

1784
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:45,519
spectrum on there

1785
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,399
that light has a lot of red um and

1786
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,319
that's because

1787
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:52,719
all leds use too much [ __ ] red

1788
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:56,719
they're trying to take the uh emerson

1789
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:58,319
too hard with photosynthesis one

1790
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,960
yeah let's see there's two types of

1791
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,960
photosynthesis

1792
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:04,798
yeah see there's two types of

1793
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,480
photosynthesis photosynthesis one and

1794
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,519
photosynthesis two

1795
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:12,000
and the that 660 red

1796
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,799
drives the photosynthesis one extremely

1797
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,719
hard

1798
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:16,560
so what that's why they put that in all

1799
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:20,640
the led lights so that they can

1800
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:22,560
pretty much uh fake the plant into

1801
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,000
that it's getting a right amount of uh

1802
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,239
daylight integral hours

1803
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
so they use the red because that red has

1804
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,959
the ability to penetrate extremely

1805
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,520
deeply

1806
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:33,679
so what's happening now is as it

1807
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,759
penetrates through the top of the canopy

1808
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,960
it adds even more red to the lower

1809
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,880
canopy because

1810
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,039
the red is getting the rest of the

1811
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,719
spectrum the rest of the spectrum gets

1812
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:45,039
absorbed through all the [ __ ] canopy

1813
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,198
and what hits the bottom is just red

1814
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:49,039
so that plants see in far too much red

1815
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:51,678
spectrum with an led light

1816
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:52,960
and not enough blue so it's not because

1817
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:55,840
it doesn't have enough uv

1818
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,319
which it doesn't because you can't get

1819
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,360
enough

1820
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:00,960
uv out of almost any uh uv

1821
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:02,479
setup like mine's got that [ __ ] in it

1822
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,000
but i'm using the sun so

1823
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:06,079
there's no way you're putting more uv

1824
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,279
than me i have the sun

1825
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:11,279
i have uh i have dennis's lights i have

1826
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:13,920
i have the stolen cure flower power like

1827
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:13,920
i just want to run

1828
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:18,480
you could be doing that too but you only

1829
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:20,319
want to run that inside for maybe one to

1830
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:21,839
three hours

1831
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:24,238
right you're not going to want to run

1832
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,840
those for the whole 12 hours of light on

1833
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:26,959
or you will make the plant get sick

1834
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,560
because

1835
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,880
it starts to [ __ ] with the hormones

1836
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,880
because you got too much uv

1837
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,960
in the spectrum like the normal amount

1838
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,520
of uv in the light spectrum is like

1839
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,079
it's like one percent over the whole dli

1840
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,640
so

1841
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,479
when you start to put in a 30 watt bulb

1842
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,640
next to a 300 watt now you've put 10

1843
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:46,559
percent of the uv into the room that it

1844
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,719
should have only had one percent

1845
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,320
during the peak of the day right so a

1846
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,679
lot of people are putting too much in

1847
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:53,279
over a long spectrum

1848
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:56,560
and the plant starts to get sick with

1849
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:58,479
that light spectrum above it

1850
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,480
light sticking when i ran the royal

1851
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:04,158
spill inside i ran

1852
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:05,439
the two hours you know at high high noon

1853
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:08,000
during my period

1854
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:09,119
during my life period and then time

1855
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,319
turned it off

1856
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:15,039
and it it worked really [ __ ] well

1857
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:16,238
works good yeah and then what else

1858
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:17,279
you're seeing is the cherry pie is

1859
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,759
shorter

1860
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:21,840
it's not getting anywhere near the

1861
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,679
amount of that light spectrum

1862
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,440
that that bruce banner seeing when it's

1863
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,158
that close when it's that close to the

1864
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,319
light

1865
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,359
the light actually can't spread the

1866
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:31,279
light far enough

1867
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:34,479
and it starts to act like a [ __ ] lens

1868
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:34,479
and penetrate it's

1869
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:42,000
because it's too [ __ ] close that's

1870
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,679
the problem with having those bars

1871
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,359
too close to the plant the bar is

1872
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,880
supposed to be up really high so they

1873
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:49,439
can spread their light

1874
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,400
if you had a single source like a

1875
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:51,919
quantum board

1876
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,238
a quantum board's not going to act that

1877
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,560
same way because it can it actually

1878
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,639
can start to mix all the light because

1879
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,320
all the diodes are so close together

1880
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,400
but the fact that you have one bar

1881
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:03,198
almost six to eight inches from the next

1882
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:06,079
bar

1883
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:07,678
you have this giant gap in between where

1884
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:09,119
nothing's blending so when you get a

1885
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,679
plant that grows real close to that

1886
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:11,039
light

1887
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,520
it doesn't see none of the light from

1888
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,519
the bar next to it at that point it's

1889
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,480
just getting saturated with this one

1890
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,239
spectrum

1891
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:19,279
and it gets a light sickness that's what

1892
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:20,319
that's what the plant's starting to

1893
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:22,639
happen

1894
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,799
i'm trying to think you see that with

1895
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,960
the blurple lights that are two purple

1896
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,400
they start getting real real purple

1897
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,480
stems and they start getting all the

1898
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:33,119
node structure extremely cramped and

1899
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:35,359
close together it's just a phenotypical

1900
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:36,960
expression of the wrong light spectrum

1901
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:38,479
that's that's the whole issue that that

1902
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,679
and that goes back to what i keep saying

1903
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,119
how do i breed

1904
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,119
for what light bulb you're going to put

1905
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:45,359
in your room and at what distance

1906
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:46,158
i can't do it [ __ ] like right now i'm

1907
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:49,679
breathing

1908
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:52,960
outdoors i didn't know that my light was

1909
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,319
too strong or lacking the spectrum if i

1910
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,719
didn't know there was an issue with the

1911
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:57,920
light

1912
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:00,800
let's just say that i would think that

1913
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:03,679
you gave me some [ __ ] up clone that

1914
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,679
wasn't bruce banner number three

1915
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,600
you know what i mean and and then i

1916
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,279
would be like oh yeah [ __ ] tony blah

1917
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:12,800
blah blah but that's not the case

1918
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:15,519
you know it's because

1919
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,920
it's because my environment has done

1920
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,840
that

1921
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,840
to the plan

1922
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:24,639
did you guys yeah i caught your brother

1923
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:26,319
you're 100 right i'm

1924
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,600
i was just showing stuff that the plants

1925
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,719
i just showed you this came from dutch

1926
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,480
bloom

1927
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,560
those are some of his black golds and

1928
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:33,919
black fruit he was on this morning i

1929
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,640
asked him if he had

1930
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,319
if he sent any of his gear to you and he

1931
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,000
said he had yeah

1932
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:42,238
he sent me some clones and some seats

1933
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,920
plus he wants me to start offering some

1934
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:46,079
gear on his site on the regenerative

1935
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,719
side so i got to hit him up

1936
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:49,760
um but yeah i've got i've got the pie

1937
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,079
hoe the black

1938
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,960
gold the black [ __ ] fruit the catholic

1939
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,000
girl scout

1940
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,439
and uh the chess cuddler from him he

1941
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,039
sent me all those

1942
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:00,719
i got those out here and i just showed

1943
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,158
you the phyrogee that i'm going to be

1944
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:04,960
reversing the fire og tonight i'm

1945
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:04,960
starting that tonight

1946
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,359
they have the black rough boot um plus

1947
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,480
like what i'm doing here i'm breeding

1948
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:12,238
all these plants out here are going to

1949
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,198
be done for breeding outdoors so that i

1950
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,238
can put

1951
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:17,519
full spectrum high intensity high uv

1952
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:19,678
light on them the only thing i can't

1953
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,520
breed for here is elevation

1954
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,359
and cold we don't get either one of

1955
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,360
those like like right now it's a hundred

1956
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:28,479
it's like 104 right now

1957
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:30,399
and it's in the shade is it

1958
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,839
isn't reading and you are you kind of

1959
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,319
high in the mountains though i mean

1960
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:37,760
elevation

1961
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:39,920
i'm at 450 feet i'm at 450 feet dude

1962
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,880
yeah reading is slow as [ __ ] i thought

1963
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,480
you guys were up higher

1964
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,159
now we are [ __ ] low and there's

1965
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:46,959
places here that are the that are

1966
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:50,238
[ __ ]

1967
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:53,359
almost sea level we are [ __ ] uh

1968
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:56,399
we're we are [ __ ] like checked

1969
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:58,000
i'm at sea level the beach is like i

1970
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:58,479

out water restrictions twice and we just

1982
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:23,519
started the summer we're [ __ ]

1983
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:24,640
like there's a creek here that's almost

1984
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,719
dry and it's it

1985

200 212 feet from the top of the uh the

1988
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:41,840
lake

1989
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:43,839

1990
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,480
they better get that heartbreaking

1991
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,800
booted up pretty quick

1992
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:50,479
dude we're [ __ ] here like if you don't

1993
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,039
live in my little town

1994
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:54,559
you literally have to stop watering you

1995
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:55,840
you can't water your plants you can't

1996
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,520
wash your cars

1997
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,279
you can't do jack [ __ ] i have a well so

1998
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,600
i can do whatever the [ __ ] i want

1999
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:03,198
but it doesn't mean that i do but like

2000
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,079
this is the smallest garden i've had

2001
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:08,000
in a long time like i usually have like

2002
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:11,279
50 pots filled out here and i

2003
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:15,600
i think i got 15 of them now so

2004
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:18,719
like being from from where i'm from

2005
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:23,280
like a shortage of water

2006
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:23,279
just seems so unfathomable

2007
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,520
we're bad and i live on aquafire like

2008
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,319
underneath me if you go

2009
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,280
like 400 feet below where i'm at right

2010
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:35,119
now we

2011
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:36,559
we're on one of the largest aquifers in

2012
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:38,479
the state of california there's no

2013
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,039
[ __ ] water here man you can't access

2014
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:40,559
it

2015
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,719
like you you're gonna have to drill a

2016
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,880
drill like a well like 800 feet

2017
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,079
to get to water right now maybe even

2018
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,039
farther than that and

2019
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:50,238
the cost on doing that is insane to

2020
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:51,920
[ __ ] to drill it

2021
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:53,519
yeah and to get a pump that can pump

2022
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,920
water that [ __ ] high i mean it's

2023
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,920
crazy

2024
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:00,000
we're gonna end up with shitty water

2025
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,679
right now too because of the way the

2026
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,439
water's sitting the water table is right

2027
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,520
now it's just filled with junk if you

2028
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:08,238
don't go deep enough

2029
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,840
yeah that's my brother he built a house

2030
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:11,359
on the same piece of property i'm at

2031
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,199
it's literally

2032
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:16,000
maybe 600 feet from where i'm at the

2033
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:19,039
other house i'm on 13 acres

2034
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,319

2035
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:21,840
will was put in

2036
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:23,519
and because of the price of drilling a

2037
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,239
well super deep he only went a certain

2038
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,320
level

2039
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:27,359

2040
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:29,039
