70
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,699
yeah we got to congre about his pipes

71
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,980
and about how about how his style of has

72
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,658
changed over the years from how now that

73
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:50,039
everyone's dabbing and

74
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:51,298
the difference in techniques that he's

75
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,859
been using in the skull techniques he's

76
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,540
been doing in the collabs with all the

77
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,340
people he's been doing he recently just

78
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,280
released this new Rhino collab that they

79
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,280
just uh released it was a rhino duck

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,019
skull uh sidecar hammer

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,239
and um

82
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,239
it was just the only one of its kind and

83
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,819
the last time that Rhino and

84
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,658
uh Bob Snodgrass said to each other that

85
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,938
they think that they'd even have a

86
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:16,680
collab together so I mean those two he's

87
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,719
two pieces alone were some of the most

88
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,879
insane pieces of the show

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,620
so yeah yeah and I think uh the homie

90
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,719
fresh press was explaining earlier that

91
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,519
Snodgrass really invented a lot of tech

92
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,139
I didn't know any of this yeah people

93
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,299
consider him the Godfather of the glass

94
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,519
pipe and like people want sometimes

95
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,020

um people will start to get like

97
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,339
nitpicky about it but like most ogs

98
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,879
would say Bob Snodgrass invented like

99
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,899

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,360
it'll be pretty good certainly you

170
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,819
certainly have the ethos to pull up with

171
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,120
some BHO I mean oh yeah definitely yeah

172
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:23,580
I'm Not Afraid yeah I'll show up and uh

173
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,259
take whatever shame there's no shame

174
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:27,300
because there doesn't need to be we're

175
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,620
talking to the person who runs the

176
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,060
secret cup here I actually I have a

177
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,038
question that I meant to ask you and I

178
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,139
never did

179
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,639
in the solvent competition days did you

180
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,179
feel like there was more of a variety of

181
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,740
Terps on the table than sort of

182
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:43,620
sometimes yes and sometimes no we did

183
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,419
have a Tangy wave I remember where it

184
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,419
was like I remember one competition was

185
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:51,179
like 10 Tangy entries or something like

186
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:54,778
that it was a lot but

187
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:57,719
um I do like that uh profile of terp so

188
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:59,700
I can't hate on it too much I miss those

189
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,420
flavors now

190
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,640
um

191
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:04,559
yes sometimes it would be very like

192
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,659
especially the early days before people

193
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,759
knew what people were gonna like

194
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:12,179
they would just come with all kinds of

195
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,338
stuff we had like a purple variety win

196
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,559
one year

197
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,380
um a lot of times they were fruity

198
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,179
varieties that were winning oh and so we

199
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,159
were you seeing like equatorial type

200
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:25,379
stuff that doesn't typically wash or

201
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,860
produce good hash or was it mostly still

202
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:31,080
fruity modern stuff so you had both cool

203
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,080
so some people would take it upon

204
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,000
themselves to do something difficult you

205
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,519
know so they were like okay not only am

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,159
I going to enter I'm going to do

207
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,360
something like where there's a story to

208
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,059
my entry

209
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,919
and uh so yeah it was It was kind of

210
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:49,799
cool in that sense

211
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:53,458
um you know I remember one of the girls

212
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,539
had uh entered a purple variety and so

213
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,879
she was

214
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:59,699
like the only female in the competition

215
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,439
first of all and then she had decided to

216
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,800
go with something totally nobody else

217
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,080
entered a purple and nobody has one with

218
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,659
something like that or competed really

219
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,778
with something like that ever since so

220
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:16,079
it was like a shot out there and and it

221
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,580
people liked it you know and it won so I

222
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,259
I was really happy to see that that's

223
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,519
cool I like it when something like that

224
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,838
happens

225
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,179
and then the other one would be

226
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,420
solventless entries like people would be

227
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:30,299
like this is a BHO competition but I'm

228
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:32,219
showing up with my solventless entry and

229
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,559
I don't care if it wins or not I'm just

230
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,540
gonna put it out there and then those

231
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,219
did start winning so

232
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:40,559
yeah

233
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,620
and I felt really bad for the people in

234
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,899
Spain they entered the Barb have you

235
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,339
ever heard of this okay is that

236
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,958
different than the Barbara bud or is

237
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,019
that no that's the same thing yeah yeah

238
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,479
yeah so people didn't know what it was

239
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,179
and they scored very low in the

240
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:02,278
competition because it was a solventless

241
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:05,159
entry and it was in Spain

242
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,419
and all the other entries were BHO for

243
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,699
the most part

244
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,519
and it showed the lack of knowledge from

245
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,620
those BHO people in Spain even though

246
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,100
they're in Spain where solventless and

247
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,500
like there's a lot of great

248
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,220
and it might even be more popular than

249
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,899
BHO out there right so like they just

250
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,000
didn't have the knowledge to be like oh

251
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,940
no this is high quality this should

252
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,519
deserves to get a higher score so that's

253
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,800
that sucks too

254
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,720
one thing I also hated was people would

255
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,539
try to send a message with their votes

256
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,000
so like if they didn't like something

257
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,980
about it they just write everything once

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,500
and they wouldn't be honest like the

259
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,240
color and the tech like some of the

260
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,740
things I remember somebody pointing out

261
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,259
they're like how do you have a better

262
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,120
color than this you know what I mean

263
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:57,000
like some of the things are close to as

264
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,120
good as they could possibly get

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,299
and so uh it would be very unfair to

266
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,700
vote somebody like a one that's like

267
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:08,338
what are you trying to do exactly

268
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:12,600
and so did they at the secret cup would

269
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:14,940
they were they labeled entries so so no

270
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,740
so the way we would do our intake is I'd

271
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,019
have a group like you guys helping me

272
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,120
out and everybody would show up with

273
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,459
their bag and they would have their

274
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,240
entries pre-grammed out into their

275
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,639
little

276
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,740
it was Point threes and then there was

277
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,220
like a few grams for the testing and for

278
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,320
we also had a dab bar at the event so

279
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,480
that was what those extra grams were for

280
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,540
but they would show up with these bags

281
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,820
and then I would give them a number

282
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:43,439
people would like hang out over there

283
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,079
while we were doing it

284
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,200
and we would organize all the kits right

285
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,659
there boom uh they'd all go in the same

286
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,759
jars they don't you could buy we'd show

287
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,319
where we bought the jars so you could

288
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,838
literally show up with your stuff

289
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,040
already Jarred and we would just have to

290
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,760
sticker it

291
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,620
and so sometimes you could tell there's

292
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,078
some some of the entries there's no

293
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,720
disguising it you know like everybody

294
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:13,078
knew that this one was a certain

295
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,959
person's because like it was so

296
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:18,299
different and it stood out but we also

297
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,699
used to do a a thing like there's video

298
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,199
of this on weed maps

299
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,620
um

300
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,899
that's the Colombian Haze we we would

301
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,778
bring out the the whole kit to people

302
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:32,159
and we'd be like pick your tell us which

303
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:33,360
one is yours

304
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,419
and

305
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,000
almost always I'd say 80 wrong

306
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:41,639
80 wrong yeah people would be like oh

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,600
that's mine they didn't they would be

308
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,919
wrong that's super funny yeah

309
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,259
that's who so we're smoking some

310
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:51,659
Colombian Haze it'll make its way to you

311
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:53,700
shortly from our friend Dave at Golden

312
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:57,480
Coast genetics

313
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:01,139
I really liked that you guys are like um

314
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,240
kind of aficionados on cannabis now and

315
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,820
uh you you have a really great knowledge

316
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,159
about stuff more so than myself I would

317
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,740
say now I would want to like ask you

318
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,838
guys questions oh dude we all have lots

319
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,299
to learn from each other for sure and we

320
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,220
appreciate the uh I think we appreciate

321
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,500
like kind of like your veteran industry

322
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,420
status and like the stories you bring to

323
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,860
the table and the wisdom well and you

324
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,439
you know as someone who has learned

325
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,079
about this stuff more recently

326
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,760
our conversation sort of expanded my

327
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,039
perspective on a lot of time I mean ba

328
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,439
Joe namely yeah yeah um you know I

329
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,078
wasn't around I feel only existed in

330
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,860
this sort of solventless superiority

331
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,239
landscape and I think there's a lot to

332
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,860
it you know what I mean like I sort of

333
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,899
know where I fall but yeah it's

334
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,339
interesting to remember and then also to

335
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,899
see people coming around and basically

336
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,459
being like well there's stuff that

337
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,839
doesn't wash and you still want to smoke

338
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:53,458
his hash oh and it should be super clean

339
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:57,360
that was one of the big things I learned

340
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:59,278
in the Seeker cup is that I would say

341
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,980
most things

342
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:05,458
are better as a BHO

343
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,039
but certain things are not and then

344
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:10,319
that's when the washing is really

345
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,319
valuable on

346
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,778
hmm well I mean Brandon used to do it

347
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,180
really often with the Skittles so the

348
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:21,838
Skittles vho that I would get I never

349
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:23,819
thought was the greatest it was good but

350
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,540
I always thought Tangy was better you

351
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,639
know uh however he would enter

352
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:34,259
solventless entries

353
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:37,019
that were really really uh

354
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:39,179
they were diverse like they had a great

355
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,480
flavor profile but they were also very

356
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:44,519
Stoney and that's hard to do with BHO I

357
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,800
feel like solving list is almost always

358
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,539
more Stony more like strong you know but

359
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,399
so much of it had I used to grow a

360
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:57,059
strain called Casey Jones

361
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,458
and it had a very like distinct smell to

362
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,958
it and when I would go to sell it people

363
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,698
would always be like whoa is this like

364
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,039
Kush they didn't know what it was like

365
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,879
it was it was odd but like appealing to

366
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,059
them

367
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:13,799
I get that smell and flavor off of

368
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:16,138
almost every solventless uh

369
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,819
uh extract that I've ever had there's

370
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,659
there's certain ones that don't have it

371
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:25,079
at all so that can be done but almost

372
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:27,600
all of them have this like Flavor that I

373
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:31,259
really liked where I'm like I wonder

374
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,720
what that is you know like um it's got

375
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:36,179
to be something you know I feel that man

376
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,660
yeah absolutely

377
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:42,500
exactly you were talking about the uh

378
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:45,899
what oh this is the the Colombian

379
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,720
yeah yeah oh what's up

380
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,860
I'm about to hit some uh full melt water

381
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,440
hash

382
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,360
the brand is uh Turtle trees The Strain

383
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,860
is OG pie breath

384
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,778
the bag size is 149 to 90u and this is

385
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,539
for my friend uh

386
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:05,099
right here packs to the Future

387
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,899
um do you have anything to say before I

388
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:10,019
try you know this is an interesting one

389
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,059
only because we also have the flower and

390
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:14,639
this is one that I think really is

391
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:17,459
shines and melt and I think that the the

392
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
hashes where it belongs and it's like

393
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,699
into the conversation we're having

394
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,519
earlier like I wonder what the third

395
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,720
reality would be if it was blasted

396
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,359
um and what that would be like but this

397
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,720
is one where the flowers is okay it's

398
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,339
good it's very good but the hash is so I

399
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,798
have a question for you guys do you ever

400
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:36,798
smoke hash not dab it

401
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:44,459
so there's various ways that you can

402
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:46,798
smoke hash right A lot of people put it

403
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,120
in like um a joint or something like

404
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,119
that

405
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:54,659
um in Amsterdam they call Tobacco and

406
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,279
hash joints stickies and then they're

407
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,279
traditionally who just left is a big fan

408
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,298
of the sticky their traditional joint is

409
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,678
um

410
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:06,599
uh spliff which everybody knows uh so

411
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,820
that's how I kind of first got

412
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,500
introduced to like various ways of

413
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:14,159
mixing it

414
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:17,700
you can obviously mix it into a bowl mix

415
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,880
it into a joint but like I used to

416
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,179
prefer like smoking it over a bed

417
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,360
of Ashes so like you would maybe smoke a

418
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:29,220
bowl in a pipe leave the ashes in the

419
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,819
pipe and then you could put little

420
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,319
chunks of hash on top of the ashes and

421
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:36,720
they would just kind of you could let

422
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,359
them catch on fire they would kind of

423
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,400
they'd Smoke on the outside like a coal

424
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,678
they'd like kind of catch and then like

425
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,660
ember in towards the center and you

426
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,960
could get it all in like one hit if you

427
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,220
really it was this was this bubble hash

428
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,400
or was this traditional it could be

429
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,019
bubble hash it could be traditional hash

430
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,320
usually the better was bubble hash yeah

431
00:18:55,019 --> 00:19:01,798
okay right but it could be Keith

432
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:06,500
it could be whatever you have and uh

433
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:10,980
I've had some really really fire fire

434
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:12,779
sifts and hashes like that that had

435
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,140
um so what I thought was interesting is

436
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:17,519
they don't represent the strain anymore

437
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,720
you would never know it was the same

438
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,480
flower

439
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,400
now this hash was amazing if I had a

440
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,720
blind test I would think it was rosin

441
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,360
[ __ ] it was super smooth I mean that oil

442
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,460
just melted just the way I like it

443
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:36,959
perfect shout out to uh Turtle trees

444
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,819
in Oregon in the future and so yeah I

445
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,558
guess what were we talked about the

446
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:42,720
standout States and you said it was some

447
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,538
of the East Coast guys

448
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,940
yeah okay sorry sure let's do it because

449
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:49,319
I mean it does feel like right now a lot

450
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,240
of the most exciting stuff is coming

451
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,038
from outside of California is I guess

452
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,440
where I'm coming from with things and so

453
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,960
these guys are from Oregon

454
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,740
um you were talking about guys Michigan

455
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,319
yeah I like to bring up Michigan uh our

456
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:08,058
Autoflower Cup winner was from Michigan

457
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:11,099
and uh I saw him

458
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:13,099
okay yes that was my event

459
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:13,099
yeah yeah

460
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,720
yes yes so yeah good to see you again as

461
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,440
well

462
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,798
um

463
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,500
yeah so Michigan I think is good

464
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,379
um obviously Colorado

465
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,359
but uh

466
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,360
I kind of feel like everywhere has it

467
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:37,639
it's just more abundant in certain

468
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:40,740
places was Oklahoma a and

469
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,538
from what I understand

470
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,538
um a lot of what's quality in Oklahoma

471
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:47,819
would be kind of

472
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:50,279
Imports there they're people that came

473
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:51,899
to Oklahoma absolutely from somewhere

474
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,339
else yeah

475
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,679
and I think shout out a lot of really

476
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:57,058
talented people who made that move and I

477
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,460
think it's cool

478
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:00,960
that I think sometimes Oklahoma for that

479
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,519
reason weed gets passed off as

480
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,200
California weed

481
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,000
um because there are certain people who

482
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,500
have their facilities out there and they

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,200
still have their Market here and it all

484
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,140
kind of so comes together overseas they

485
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,538
think they get California weed so the

486
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,179
the packaging being sold

487
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:20,038
can be shipped overseas very easily and

488
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,080
legally

489
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,839
and you can put whatever in that

490
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,558
packaging so

491
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,558
absolutely

492
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:32,119
what is what is this you uh

493
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,538
nice

494
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,700
we're smoking on some uh Suave from the

495
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,480
boys sour waves you already know King

496
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,480
sour waves

497
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:51,779
so as far as 37 Fino as far as I know

498
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:54,000
got some jars you already know we come

499
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,918
in with that shirt banger

500
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,500
a bunch of other [ __ ]

501
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,700
so when when we were doing dispensaries

502
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,220
back in the day

503
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:06,000
there were always like certain strains

504
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:08,940
that were like every dispensary and uh I

505
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,240
feel like that's

506
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,820
it so the strains that would be like

507
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,380
there'd be a variety of ogs sometimes

508
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:19,079
they'd be like the planetary the

509
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:22,620
planetarium it would be like

510
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,538
um the the abrasive cut the

511
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:28,918
um there was like all these different

512
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:28,919
ones jet fuel like

513
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,798
jet fuel might be a different thing like

514
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:37,740
there were jet fuel OG back then I don't

515
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,839
know if that actually has anything

516
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:44,400
genetically to do with what jet fuel is

517
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:46,558
now but uh back then that was one there

518
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,798
was Deadhead OG there was like a

519
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,019
gazillion different Larry OG there was

520
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:52,579
like so many and

521
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,500
um

522
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:58,558
so you would have a variety of ogs there

523
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,319
would be like a Jack Herer or um maybe

524
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,779
like a train wreck sometimes or some

525
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,480
other kind of lemony that was your piano

526
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:08,700
category yeah Jack Herer almost always

527
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,519
then there would be like green crack or

528
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,460
blue dream or both that's what I would

529
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,960
get yeah yeah and uh a lot of times I

530
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,298
like the Green Crack that's one of my

531
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,240
favorite like chirping profiles out of

532
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:22,798
any strain ever and the hash I think is

533
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,058
great

534
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,339
um

535
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:28,500
then there would be like granddaddy or

536
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:30,899
purple Urkel or something like that

537
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,480
there would be they tried to have a

538
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,880
little like a variety of everything

539
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,419
and I don't think they do that now

540
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:42,000
I think they I think it's harder yeah

541
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,080
215 makes everything harder yeah

542
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
um

543
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,558
which is why it's come it's great to

544
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,480
come to a session to get to see so many

545
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,918
cool different things for sure see like

546
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,798
I don't know so what did we think of

547
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,440
that Colombian that we just smoked

548
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:59,119
yeah I thought that was really nice

549
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,120
minty's for sure minty

550
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:05,230
[Applause]

551
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,780
I said I thought it tasted really nice I

552
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,058
didn't honestly love the smell out of

553
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,099
the jar but it smoked really nice it's

554
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:18,599
good reminds me of some old weed we used

555
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:20,719
to smoke

556
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,719
yeah

557
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:26,279
oh it is gonna work and the the stuff

558
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:29,939
from sour waves is really nice too it's

559
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,940
just a classic gelatoy

560
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,919
a

561
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,360
I like this one too though

562
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:49,798
[Music]

563
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:54,359
I think the flavor really shines up to

564
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:56,519
six or seven hits I mean if it is RS

565
00:24:54,359 --> 00:25:00,298
if you know you know I think it has a

566
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:06,960
lot more guava to me than uh

567
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:09,720
the Oz right ozx or ozk excuse me and uh

568
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,720
I like it yeah I honestly wasn't loving

569
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,058
it at first but yeah it's just it's it's

570
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,880
a smooth representation of like it's

571
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:21,599
more Sherby than the RS

572
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,000
it's really good yeah yeah totally I

573
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,619
mean I love everything he does

574
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,480
girls with some pretty good weed and

575
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:30,479
he's a really nice guy

576
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,819
hell yeah no thank you for sharing that

you about to go all the way

580
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,558
not that far we're here from uh

581
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,900
Oceanside California you already know

582
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,058
San Diego on the map

583
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,278
where do the genetics come from

584
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:49,139
uh this is uh

585
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,119
like where does the RS come from I'm

586
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:54,000
pretty sure it's from do yeah I'm pretty

587
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,239
sure it's from do Farms okay in in

588
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,940
Oakland yeah from Oakland yeah okay

589
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,159
and so this is a very modern people

590
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,440
really like his work he did the rs11

591
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,260
that was pretty prominent and then the

592
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,620
zope recently and then there's some

593
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:12,480
serious uh cannabis genetics out in the

594
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,278
Bay Area for sure

595
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,440
I would say as someone who's not from

596
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,538
there the most serious like that's I

597
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,960
mean everything that I admire

598
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:23,879
is from up there it's very good yeah it

599
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,278
might very well be the most the modern

600
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,480
game right is built on gelato in my

601
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:31,200
opinion or

602
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,860
certain things of gelato crosses so

603
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,120
that's where it's from yeah yeah

604
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:38,759
interesting and then even the old like

605
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,859
the old NorCal perps like

606
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:43,500
perp I mean I was I wasn't there for

607
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:47,339
that time honestly I can't front but

608
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,919
I was yeah yeah what was your favorite

609
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:53,339
of the NorCal purps so I always like to

610
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,220
purple Urkel and um

611
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:58,199
like obviously the the pop the popular

612
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,140
one was granddaddy purple that was the

613
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,419
one that everybody knew but like I would

614
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,700
sometimes get a variety of granddaddy

615
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:07,980
that was really nice but usually it was

616
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,000
other purple varieties uh purple

617
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:14,339
princess I had once and that like I

618
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,159
remember getting the bags from that and

619
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:20,158
it looked like Toys R Us weed like it

620
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:22,980
was it looked fake like if you got some

621
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,480
weed that was just so colored yeah it

622
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,079
was like not real

623
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,940
that's sick

624
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:33,058
and then the perps

625
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,220
I've had that a few times

626
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:38,220
and it wasn't like that purpley in

627
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:42,120
flavor but it was purpley like super

628
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,960
potent very very strong like a narcotic

629
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,879
and it's interesting that you

630
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,140
distinguish purple as like a flavor from

631
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,940
appearance because I feel like a lot of

632
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,720
the best Urkel I've smoked is pretty

633
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:54,960
green oh yeah absolutely it's I've been

634
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,839
on farms where the plants are like half

635
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,159
purple half green one plant

636
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,899
and it just comes sometimes that way

637
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,539
a lot of times the purple is like

638
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,400
something the plant does genetically but

639
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:11,099
other times it's just something it does

640
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,400
kind of from climate and other other

641
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:13,399
things

642
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,659
that makes sense yeah it makes good

643
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,778
sense purple is one of my favorite

644
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:24,299
varieties I miss the purple being like

645
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:27,298
as prevalent as it was

646
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:28,019
I I hope it comes back yeah

647
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:29,879
um

648
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:31,859
yeah because I also feel like it's one

649
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,039
of the nicer effect profiles oh for sure

650
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:37,619
especially as flour

651
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:41,640
smoking it I love it it's one of my

652
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:43,678
favorites it just is very peaceful maybe

653
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,538
more than sort of the

654
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,700
I mean the other stuff you know the more

655
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:49,379
modern stuff like even this is nice it's

656
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,120
but it has an uplifting poly hybrid

657
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,919
thing you know there is something in it

658
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,298
oh yeah for sure that gives you that in

659
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,299
all of the gelatos and it's why people

660
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:59,038
love it it's such an everyday

661
00:28:56,298 --> 00:29:01,440
consistent but it's also cool to go back

662
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,900
and try things that don't have all of

663
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,900
that poly hybrid I think a lot of the

664
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:10,080
things will come back because

665
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,419
um people just aren't used to the you

666
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,418
kind of you get caught up in whatever's

667
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:17,400
going and you can easily kind of forget

668
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,980
about the things you used to like or

669
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,080
maybe you didn't get exposed to yeah

670
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,058
yeah

671
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,759
no absolutely and I feel like I'm still

672
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:29,339
learning about this stuff like these

673
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,919
gazes that we just like to me I would

674
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:34,439
say that that smells almost kind of wet

675
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,600
but it didn't smoke wet at all so this

676
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,600
is the Colombian yeah okay so that makes

677
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,658
sense to me Hayes has been around since

678
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:45,359
the 60s right late 60s 70s it's one of

679
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:47,760
the originals yeah it's like a wartime

680
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,719
era type of strain my friend Todd

681
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:56,038
McCormick who runs authentic genetics

682
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,740
is like the official Haze yeah like so I

683
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:00,658
would refer to him yeah on anything that

684
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,399
I would say but yeah it is like one of

685
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:04,260
those early on

686
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,538
um I can't remember I think it's a Sam

687
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:08,220
the skunk man one of those ones that he

688
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,879
brought over

689
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,919
um

690
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,200
so it's it's one of the very very first

691
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,179
but I also feel like Hayes it's one of

692
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,580
those things where it there is a cross

693
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:19,620
right that is the haze but then it also

694
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:21,720
sort of is people refer to a certain

695
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:24,239
genotype generally as like hazes whereas

696
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,620
like this is probably you know that's a

697
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,058
good point and I've heard and it's an

698
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:30,298
interesting thing because there is a

699
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:31,980
proper cross that was right I am

700
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:36,480
referring to something that would be

701
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:38,519
genetically a haze variety yeah and uh

702
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,159
that is different than things that

703
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,500
people sometimes refer to as hazes kind

704
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,059
of like sativas sounds like a category

705
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,380
well I feel like it sort of is these

706
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:51,658
more equatorial lighter not very fruity

707
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:55,440
more incense I was gonna say I've had a

708
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:58,679
Colombian Haze in Amsterdam

709
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,080
it was fruity it was like super potent

710
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,559
it was one of the best hazes I've ever

711
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:06,240
had nice and um I can't remember the the

712
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,240
seed company but it was I think it might

713
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,778
have been Barney's oh cool and uh it was

714
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,058
Colombian Haze yeah please please

715
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:17,819
I think I stole your seat no dude this

716
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:19,319
couch is forever we're talking Hayes

717
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:21,500
which is one that you can chop it up

718
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,500
about

719
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:29,158
oh yeah yeah

720
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,360
we do in fact have the real piff on the

721
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,278
table I didn't bring the other ones but

722
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,038
I've got from my friend my same friends

723
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:37,319
Library we got the Velvet Buzz saw which

724
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,000
is like a Thai Haze and then we got [ __ ]

725
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,759
what else we got the bubble Tom Hill

726
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,319
Haze we got the [ __ ] what was this

727
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,158
what the other one is so I just caught

728
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:49,500
myself uh when I encounter good weed

729
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,860
I'll like sniff it like four or five

730
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:55,140
times in a row and I'm like oh that was

731
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:57,058
good no sit there for a minute and then

732
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,278
I'll catch myself after like the third

733
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:01,139
or fourth time being like

734
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,319
you already know what this smells like

735
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,360
but it's the triple tape yeah no I know

736
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,099
yeah it's a very good impulse

737
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,759
yeah that's that's the kind of read I

738
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:11,839
like

739
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:15,298
very very sativa

740
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:17,519
but I also said so like I've had some

741
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:20,398
weed like this that was like Scentsy

742
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:24,298
star or something like that very very

743
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:26,278
similar like some of the uh I I think uh

744
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:28,319
Todd is doing something

745
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,819
or like someone he knows is doing

746
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,398
something where they're trying to kind

747
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:34,798
of establish

748
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,959
um characteristics of the plants where

749
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:41,278
you can really identify what is an

750
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,399
authentic new genetic cross and what is

751
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,880
somebody naming a phenotype after

752
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:49,139
themselves or something

753
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,020
so

754
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,480
I think a lot of the new strains over

755
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:57,058
the years have not been authentically

756
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,038
different than uh some of their original

757
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:01,859
parents to the earlier conversation we

758
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,599
were having there's you know so since

759
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:06,298
cookies and I mean really if you're

760
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,038
talking then it's since OG so much of it

761
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:09,480
has been bag seed across something where

762
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:12,058
it's getting bottlenecked so much that

763
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,399
these crosses that are probably the

764
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:17,099
progeny of different parents

765
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:20,099
are the same bottleneck thing and it's

766
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:22,980
like okay well this Cross of the cookie

767
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:25,740
stuff tastes a heck of a lot like this

768
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,058
cross the cookie stuff absolutely you

769
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,500
know when I haven't seen all of them in

770
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:30,178
the garden but at least from in the

771
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,679
mouth it's they're very similar but

772
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,298
they're they are different crops and

773
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,278
then like as you talk to breeders you

774
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:38,700
can be like okay how many phenos do you

775
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:42,919
see of your plant by the way what are we

776
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:46,140
rolling next We're Gonna Roll some piths

777
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:49,380
so so I know I know breeders that have

778
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:53,460
like four phenos you know yeah not a lot

779
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:57,840
and most though are like 12

780
00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:00,659
different phenos there's like 16 phinos

781
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:03,898
you know like you can get anything in

782
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:05,760
this situation and then as you're

783
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:08,519
growing these plants there's obviously

784
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,559
The Growers influence on how the plant

785
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:12,599
is going to produce and like represent

786
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,719
these different aspects of its genetics

787
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,838
and so uh

788
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:22,858
how authentically different are some of

789
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:25,378
these plants I Todd

790
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:27,659
Todd would say that almost none of them

791
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:30,960
are different yeah you know yeah totally

792
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:34,619
it's very likely we're dealing with like

793
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,440
maybe 10 varieties or something like

794
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:39,960
that like like I don't know if it's

795
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,240
quite that low but

796
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,599
um I also don't know I maybe Mis

797
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:48,000
misrepresenting but uh I think it's far

798
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,559
fewer than the thousands of varieties

799
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,300
that we have

800
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:55,679
uh likes available by seed yeah totally

801
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,900
uh

802
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,539
I love breeding and I love the science

803
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,059
of breeding like we we gave leaves at

804
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,460
the Autoflower cup to a company that's

805
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,858
doing like DNA testing

806
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,440
and they're trying to establish genetic

807
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:13,319
markers in in the plants so that they

808
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,920
can say this is a sativa this is an

809
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:20,400
Indica this is OG this is whatever this

810
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,220
is an auto flower you know

811
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,400
absolutely yeah so autoflowering is

812
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:30,059
basically fast flowering

813
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,220
yes yeah this has become my specialty uh

814
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:34,380
I was never I was like a small proponent

815
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:36,899
of this over the years but I was never a

816
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,740
Believer until recently

817
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,338
um

818
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:45,000
now bringing Autoflower has come to a

819
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:47,699
point where most plants I would say are

820
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
competitive or better than their photo

821
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:53,759
period uh brothers and sisters right so

822
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,780
uh an Autoflower plant you plant the

823
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,000
seed

824
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:01,140
and you have

825
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,239
a hundred grams in nine weeks that's the

826
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:05,639
way they like me to describe it

827
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:08,639
okay so that's the simple

828
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:11,460
way of describing it but basically these

829
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:14,279
plants come from a place where the sun

830
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,619
wasn't setting on normal hours and

831
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:20,040
cannabis is a weed it's very resilient

832
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:22,858
it developed a way of living in these

833
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:24,119
climates where you'll have long periods

834
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:27,420
of sunlight

835
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,880
so autofire plants don't mature based on

836
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,800
the sun you could give them very little

837
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,900
light you could give them a lot of light

838
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,200
and they're going to grow at the same

839
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:41,300
pace and be finished roughly at the same

840
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,299
time no matter what you do to it

841
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,960
yeah yeah exactly so places like Russia

842
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,599
places where

843
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:53,880
you know you don't have a full outdoor

844
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:55,400
season they they do auto flowers and up

845
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,858
until recently

846
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,019
the THC percentages and the terpene

847
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:02,279
profiles have not really been that

848
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:04,679
impressive

849
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,240
but within the last five years they've

850
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,699
started to get really good

851
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:11,059
and then within the last I'd say two

852
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:14,699
maybe one year

853
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:18,179
they've really become what they are now

854
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:20,279
and so in our competition I saw some of

855
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:21,059
the plants we have like we tested them

856
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,019
all

857
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:27,420
we had one of them that was 29 THC and

858
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:30,780
like the bag appeal is exactly like

859
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:34,079
Photo period smells like the terpene

860
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:37,079
profile is exactly the same so at that

861
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,660
point if you can get like a super silver

862
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,079
haze or something like that and you can

863
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:44,940
grow it and that short period of time

864
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,359
why would you not do that

865
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:52,079
a lot of the varieties that are popular

866
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:54,119
you can get as Autoflower seeds and you

867
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,400
can grow those so if you're an outdoor

868
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,559
grower let's say and you have a big

869
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,500
outdoor area where you move your plants

870
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:05,039
at a point in the year you could pop

871
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,300
Autos in that Garden up until the time

872
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,719
where you're gonna move your photo

873
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:14,160
periods out there and like triple your

874
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:16,980
Harvest so they really show a great

875
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,598
opportunity for Growers they're also

876
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,099
good for amateur Growers where like

877
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,280
maybe your lights

878
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:25,440
go off or you know you have problems and

879
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,859
so they're not going to just die you

880
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,619
know they're gonna mostly live and

881
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:33,299
obviously they might hermaphrodite if

882
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,500
you're exposing them to a lot of like

883
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,039
negative

884
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,079
uh

885
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,460
climate and these kind of things they'll

886
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,359
do the same kind of thing that photo

887
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,358
periods would do

888
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,660
yeah

889
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,659
yeah no worries

890
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,480
and I I'm seeing Autos kind of take over

891
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,039
and so when I've talked to other

892
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,199
breeders

893
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,320
they're like 80 percent of the business

894
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,539
is going to become Autos so it's really

895
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,220
good to start now start learning it's

896
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:09,779
going to be a learning curve it's not

897
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:12,358
immediately like probably you're gonna

898
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,920
do great but

899
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:16,199
it's worth it

900
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,019
so I've been encouraging people the

901
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:20,578
Autoflower cup is probably going to be

902
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:22,920
in the Bay Area

903
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:26,579
so I've actually spoken to the people

904
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,320
from Spain now and it looks like we

905
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:29,820
might be doing the Bay Area if we don't

906
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,640
do the Bay Area we're going to do the

907
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:35,700
beach out here in La again

908
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:39,739
so that's awesome and that's January so

909
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:39,739
you could start Autos now and compete

910
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:45,838
it's definitely an emerging category

911
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:47,779
yeah and I I'm really happy to see it I

912
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,099
like kind of representing the underdog

913
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:52,740
and uh

914
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:54,300
I I'm I'm really hopeful I want to see

915
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:56,639
the hash well and you have a track

916
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,700

so he he has so many people that like

992
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:51,479
follow him and want him and his culture

993
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,719
is so big and large yeah yeah that's

994
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,719
awesome

995
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:04,500
so what else do you guys like as glass

996
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:06,239
these days who's the hot glass artist so

997
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,460
I mean right now one of the hottest is

998
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,199
outside

999
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,179
okay yeah Elijah Copeland Elijah

1000
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:13,259
Copeland is the most wanted one of

1001
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:15,299
probably one of the most Wanted artists

1002
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:18,300
so I was familiar with contrabasso

1003
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:21,980
because of his uh recyclers

1004
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,980
is that still what is popular

1005
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,060
on the uh the recycler called the hyper

1006
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:33,059
cycler okay I'm not familiar with that

1007
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:36,059
one they uh I think now his retail is 60

1008
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:39,420
60 starting at 60 000. wow

1009
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:41,880
yeah the prices of glass if you can are

1010
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,400
able to even get one right he's he only

1011
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,880
makes five pipes a year because he can

1012
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,119
right and his demand is so high

1013
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,119
foreign

1014
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:02,399
I'll go the full circle right so when I

1015
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:04,200
first like liked glass I was just a kid

1016
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,300
going into a head shop and I looked at

1017
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,719
pipes and I was like damn that one's

1018
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,720
dope

1019
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:20,720
I would say late 90s late 90s yeah like

1020
00:44:16,818 --> 00:44:23,639
97 8 probably even that rum

1021
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,980
oh yeah I'm gonna get there so they

1022
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:29,219
didn't sign the pieces they weren't like

1023
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,500
oh this is a this guy's piece like that

1024
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:34,139
wasn't that it was just oh these are the

1025
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,139
heady ones they're expensive and then

1026
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:38,818
these are the like lower prices

1027
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:41,759
expensive was like

1028
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:45,300
like 500 bucks to

1029
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:49,619
like maybe a couple thousand tops no no

1030
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:52,859
more than three so let's say 500 to a

1031
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:55,140
thousand right and what 97 what are we

1032
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:57,779
talking yeah yeah what what years are we

1033
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:59,279
talking about so I I used to buy a pipe

1034
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,260
every year I would go to the Cannabis

1035
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,500
Cup because when you would take a pipe

1036
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:07,619
like that to Amsterdam they've had no

1037
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,420
artists zero artists like that so they

1038
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:11,640
would see these like pipes and they'd be

1039
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,400
like what the [ __ ] this was in the 90s

1040
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:16,980
correct yes it was late 90s and early

1041
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,780
2000s all right so let's say with

1042
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,240
inflation you're still looking at like

1043
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,240
two thousand dollars so so right like

1044
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:27,838
around the same I I have a pipe I bought

1045
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:30,539
it for 500 back then I didn't know who

1046
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:34,440
the artist was but after I started

1047
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:36,480
meeting all of the glass blowers I asked

1048
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,460
my friend I'm like hey do you think we

1049
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,740
could figure it out he said yes I'll

1050
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,960
post it on my Facebook

1051
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:45,358
like hundreds of glass blowers will see

1052
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,280
it we'll figure it out posted it people

1053
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,219
started saying I think it's a Darby they

1054
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,500
started tagging Darby in it Darby is

1055
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:55,259
like uh nope but I think it's my brother

1056
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Carstens and so he tags Carson's

1057
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:02,520
Carson's like yep he made it so it's a

1058
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:05,639
Karsten Carlisle from like 2002.

1059
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:07,858
okay I have this pipe do you see the

1060
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:10,559
difference in glass from now though

1061
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:12,989
I asked him what he thought it was worth

1062
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,818
he thought it was worth like three grand

1063
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:17,759
[Applause]

1064
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:20,099
that's yeah I'm good with that but I

1065
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,079
like I'm with you I'm like man no but

1066
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:26,280
you do you do see the difference right

1067
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,500
in class like oh I keep it yeah I

1068
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:32,160
brought it to Amsterdam I smoked with it

1069
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:34,079
like it's you know this is this is not

1070
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,719
just a collectible to me it was like a

1071
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,099
pipe that I have memories with yeah

1072
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:41,338
oh

1073
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:43,980
so for example your common Rhino your

1074
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:47,338
common Mueller you know your common

1075
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,579
Darby that style was not around in the

1076
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:53,699
90s correct not at all no okay so that's

1077
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:56,940
where I put the value into it I back

1078
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:59,219
then I didn't see too much symmetry it

1079
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,440
was more like hand blown hand blown no

1080
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:03,480
molds nothing so there were steps like

1081
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,760
so as the different techniques were

1082
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:09,000
developed like I remember when Inside

1083
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,640
Out glass came out inside out glass you

1084
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,579
know because before that it was just

1085
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:18,000
like rap and rake like drone Baker style

1086
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:20,400
you know there would be fumed and like

1087
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,500
that was basically it and then they

1088
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,519
started figuring out like oh you can

1089
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,219
like

1090
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,500
do frit on a pipe and turn it inside out

1091
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:31,199
and then it looks like totally different

1092
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:34,619
and so different techniques would happen

1093
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:36,659
and then you would see it reflected with

1094
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,338
time yeah well right now the rigs that

1095
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:41,879
I'm looking at they usually they're made

1096
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:44,219
in segments so it one one entire rig

1097
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,140
could have art within the art within the

1098
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,779
art absolutely you could have Millis

1099
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:50,879
within a marble that's encased yeah

1100
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,680
that's on the shoulder of like a duck

1101
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,440
and then the dude had to make the body

1102
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:57,899
it's like things I think that's where

1103
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,900
the price goes so so my current favorite

1104
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:04,500
artist that I saw at the last time I was

1105
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,940
at glass Vegas was lace face lace face

1106
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,000
yeah

1107
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:11,539
how long have has he been around she she

1108
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,019
has been around for a while

1109
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:15,019
game yeah

1110
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,700
50 to 60 000 right now I was like lace I

1111
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:25,559
saw her and I said I think you're doing

1112
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:27,598
better work than what Dar than what

1113
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:30,179
banjo is putting out right now like

1114
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,818
banjo's pieces are insane but he is

1115
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:34,759
capable of more than what these like

1116
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:39,300
single color

1117
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:42,060
yeah I've hit that one yeah so like it

1118
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,920
used to be you would go to age right you

1119
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:46,619
go to age and then you go to like

1120
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,579
hitman's room and then Doug would have

1121
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:49,579
like a secret room

1122
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:56,098
the one I hit was it was like the one

1123
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,139
where it was like the angel like

1124
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,180
spreading its wings and like like

1125
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:01,019
kissing and I think you hit it off of

1126
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:03,598
the

1127
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:06,440
the face and it was a standing one it

1128
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,440
was like this tall

1129
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:18,659
so uh my friend Doug had a special piece

1130
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:20,880
that looked like just regular Chinese

1131
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:24,899
writing but you would pull it off the

1132
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,119
wall and it was a piece I couldn't tell

1133
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,619
that it was a piece until he plucked It

1134
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,900
Off the Wall Doug had a lot of cool

1135
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:32,640
pieces you know man he had a lot of cool

1136
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,760
pieces

1137
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,980
yeah all the Star Wars ones yeah um I

1138
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,319
think uh the Star Wars one ended with my

1139
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:43,800
friend Pier star they were like a

1140
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:47,099
cartridge a company a pen distillate

1141
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:51,300
company but I remember Darth Vader Vader

1142
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:55,500
helmet came out at Champs and like

1143
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:57,839
it was 30 grand ended up selling for 35

1144
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,599
000. yeah fifty thousand dollars and it

1145
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:04,199
was the highest priced piece ever at

1146
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:07,019
that point that's crazy yeah so

1147
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,779
the prices went up quick when I first

1148
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:12,599
started getting into rigs they were like

1149
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:15,780
tops maybe like five grand you know that

1150
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,640
was that was like maybe like a Toro or

1151

giant T-rex head I I was like who

1155
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,559
appraised this but I guess yeah that's

1156
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,359
what people praised glass for three

1157
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,639
hundred thousand fruits that's whatever

1158

1167
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,239
[Music]

sold is Buck uh Buck glass uh made like

1171
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,558

1172
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,300
eight foot sexual alligator or crocodile

1173
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:06,180
yeah out of full glass that was

1174
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,220
suspended in like in the in the on the

1175
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:09,659
ceiling in an Australian Gallery okay I

1176
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:12,058
think it just sold recently to a

1177
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:13,679
collector in Florida for 250k that's

1178
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:15,359
dope like hand delivered but like yeah

1179
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:17,279
that's it's for that but it's different

1180
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,380
so I have a cool buck and and Darby

1181
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,960
story so the first time we ever met them

1182
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:24,900
there was a trade show in Los Angeles

1183
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:27,300
called the international glass Expo or

1184
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,800
something like that and it was at the

1185
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,000
Los Angeles

1186
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,099
um

1187
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,739
the the place across the street from the

1188
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:36,300
Staple Center I forget what it's called

1189
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:39,000
yeah Convention Center Los Angeles

1190
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:42,119
Convention Center so

1191
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,099
we had a booth there I was writing for a

1192
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:46,440
magazine and I think I got a free booth

1193
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:48,720
at that time and then I sold it or I

1194
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,720
shared it with somebody and so we had a

1195
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:54,659
booth there and it was like a wholesale

1196
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,858
and uh uh retail show so there was a

1197
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:57,420
retail side and then there's a hotel

1198
00:51:55,858 --> 00:52:00,239
sign

1199
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:03,838
it was the deadest glass show I have

1200
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,338
ever been to no like nobody came it was

1201
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:07,440
so empty

1202
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:09,539
some people went to the wholesale side

1203
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,480
they had like some

1204
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:15,358
retail side was like pathetically bad

1205
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,460
and me and my friend like we had set up

1206
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:20,039
a whole booth and everything and we

1207
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,900
didn't care we were just like stoked and

1208

Lace face was there and like certain

1209
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,680

00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:28,139
to like get to see all these like cool

1211
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,980

um uh at the time it was new it was uh

1214
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:37,739
oh I'm forgetting the technique

1215
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:41,300
um it's where you like have the copper

1216
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:43,379
that goes on the outside of the glass

1217
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,960
electroforming yeah so electroforming

1218
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:47,838
had just come out and so he had bought

1219
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,940

1220
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:53,699

1238

really nice and cool and like

1240

they're like his family his brothers I I

1252
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:17,818
feel two ways about it so like the

1253
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:19,919
people that are nice like Darby and all

1254
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:22,079
them I love them and I'm glad that they

1255
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,700
have the easy jobs that they have it's

1256
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,339
not easy for them I know that it's hard

1257
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:28,558
for Darby you know it's not like he

1258
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:30,179
makes five pieces a year or whatever you

1259
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,339
know what I mean some of these people

1260
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:35,039
are family men too yeah he's a family

1261
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:37,019
guy he has like it's it's not just like

1262
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:38,880
a cakewalk you know but it's good that

1263
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:41,159
he's getting the respect he has there's

1264
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,079
certain people out there

1265
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:45,539
I

1266
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:48,720
I so I remember when Sokol was really

1267
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:49,920
popular never heard of him okay

1268
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,519
so

1269
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,099
um he's not so popular anymore

1270
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:59,759
when did he have his start

1271
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:02,880
so the thing about it was for whatever

1272
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,740
reason I think his personality ruined

1273
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,680
his art

1274
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:10,139
you know the person behind the thing

1275
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:13,199
like you just had too many bad things

1276
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:15,659
happen publicly with people

1277
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,799
to where his art was not able to

1278
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:19,078
continue

1279
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,720
yeah I know I know that he had made yeah

1280
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:24,359
he had a whole bunch of like really

1281
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:27,419
really cringy moments

1282
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:30,299
right that like negatively affected his

1283
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,619
art where all the at these things where

1284
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:34,079
all the collectors are there this

1285
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:35,519
community it's a small community they

1286
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,800
was talking about it like everybody

1287
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:39,599
knows is everything and so like I'm not

1288
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,960
throwing him under the bus saying the

1289
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:46,260
stories but I do feel like

1290
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,800
like it was authentically the person

1291
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:52,200
you know maybe he did deserve to lose

1292
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,619
the value of his pieces if he's gonna be

1293
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:58,259
acting this way and doing these things

1294
00:55:55,619 --> 00:56:01,440
um and there's other people that I don't

1295
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:04,140
think uh like deserve the value they

1296
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,039
have of their their pieces they're maybe

1297
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:07,500
like

1298
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:10,318
you could be cool about it you know you

1299
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,139
can be a nice person like it's a

1300
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:14,579
blessing when you have that

1301
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:16,440
you don't need to be like you should

1302
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:19,818
hear like have you heard the way they

1303
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,818
talk about like heady boys

1304
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:30,119
yeah it's been crazy yeah yeah it's nuts

1305
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,280
so I just it's very interesting to me to

1306
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:35,099
to wear like

1307
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,440
like you basically hate the people that

1308
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:39,440
support you

1309
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:42,599
[Laughter]

1310
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:45,780
do you own any glass of your own

1311
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,700
so yes yes I own some glass I don't have

1312
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:51,180
anything super fancy

1313
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:52,318
I have a Merc piece that's pretty nice

1314
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:54,598
um

1315
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:58,440
I used to have a problem where I wanted

1316
00:56:54,599 --> 00:57:00,960
to buy a piece at every show and so I

1317
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,480
went with what I could afford and what

1318
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,858
visually was appealing to me

1319
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:09,000
so

1320
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:11,219
uh most of my glass is worthless I have

1321
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,338
a shitload of Hitman pieces

1322
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:15,838
shout out to Doug Hitman the value of

1323
00:57:14,338 --> 00:57:18,299
that or not

1324
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:19,920
a lot went on with Hitman to where some

1325
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,260
of it might not be as valuable some of

1326
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:26,099
it might be more valuable

1327
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:27,780
so I have like a couple dabbacinos

1328
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:29,940
you know I don't know what people would

1329
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:33,019
pay for that now yeah I have those I

1330
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,019
have those same slides

1331
00:57:34,858 --> 00:57:40,139
yeah and uh good luck to Doug and the

1332
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,180
best of New York it looks like it's

1333
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:43,980
going to be a great show everyone should

1334
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:46,858
go

1335
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:48,900
and they have a a question for you have

1336
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:51,179
you when's the last time you owned or

1337
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:55,338
have you ever owned a China rig

1338
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:55,338
oh so I don't hate on it at all

1339
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:02,400
like I love my China rig rig but I

1340
00:57:59,818 --> 00:58:04,500
definitely have China like nails can you

1341
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,559
tell me the pros and cons of China glass

1342
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:10,679
please your opinion what you your

1343
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:12,540
experience so I know

1344
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:14,460
like

1345
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:16,800
what I'll say is like some of the

1346
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:18,838
Chinese artists are stepping it up

1347
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,920
and some of the art is authentically

1348
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:23,000
dope

1349
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:28,159
right like sir I agree

1350
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:31,460
over there huh for example MJ Arsenal

1351
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:35,098
it's a uh I would say a California

1352
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:38,579
designed and uh manufactured in China

1353
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:39,960
brand but I asked an American Artist to

1354
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:42,900
recreate it

1355
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,679
and he told me he would uh charge me

1356
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:47,760
about

1357
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:49,980
600 to 800 to recreate it and I'm like

1358
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,160
oh man I I got this piece for 50 bucks

1359
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:55,798
so yeah yeah there's a value to that and

1360
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:58,399
I think when when you're smoking there's

1361
00:58:55,798 --> 00:59:01,280
like functionality and then there is

1362
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:05,099
Vanity okay

1363
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,200
keyword Vanity Vanity and that is

1364
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:09,119
entirely what all the glass stuff is

1365
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:10,980
about people are gonna be like no I like

1366
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,660
the way that it looks and they'll say

1367
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,818
this whole thing about how it makes them

1368
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:17,399
feel I'm a function guy to be honest but

1369
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:20,159
like when you're buying a sixty thousand

1370
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,079
dollar rig or whatever you're buying

1371
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,000
that for me it's like who has the

1372
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,980
biggest boat and the biggest truck

1373
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,579
correct that's what it is it's it's

1374
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:32,400
buying a fancy it's buying fancy clothes

1375
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:34,859
you're trying man we want the biggest

1376
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,260
boat and I I get it and there is

1377
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:39,420
definitely a value to that when I've

1378
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,059
owned things and you like walk into a

1379
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:44,940
place and everybody's like whoa what is

1380
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:46,079
that like it feels good yeah it feels

1381
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,760
way better than when you have some

1382
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,400
shitty thing and everybody's like can

1383
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:54,180
hey do you want to borrow a nail or like

1384
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,460
you know whatever yeah I totally agree I

1385
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:57,598
mean I'm I'm guilty of having uh one

1386
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,358
China rig

1387
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,460
I have about nine other rigs but one

1388
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:05,039
China rig for sure so so I did say I

1389
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,079
have a bunch of Hitman Glass so I don't

1390
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,480
know if that counts I like Hitman man

1391
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:10,980
all his new stuff is crazy you guys

1392
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,460
should check out all his new stuff it's

1393
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:17,099
super unique it's all him yeah uh the

1394
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:19,139
compound was it the compound or the the

1395
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:21,298
double helix there was a few really

1396
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:23,279
really cool compounds it's called it's

1397
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:24,960
called the compound series if I'm

1398
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,359
correct those are really cool it's a

1399
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,960
series of rigs that look like they're uh

1400
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:33,659
just molecules to say Doug gets knocked

1401
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,599
off by everybody like what the [ __ ]

1402
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:38,940
happens like it's I've seen the compound

1403
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:41,760
cube in downtown L.A right there crazy

1404
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:44,639
how quickly it happens where he'll come

1405
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:47,220
out with something and they are on it so

1406
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:50,519
fast to just copy him and do it for

1407
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:53,399
cheaper so I think that sucks

1408
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:55,440
that uh there should be more forgiveness

1409
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,880
for that but whatever absolutely

1410
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,960
absolutely

1411
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,240
yeah you want to try and dab my BHO

1412
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,639
or maybe I mean do it do you mind if I

1413
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:09,000
heat you up yeah because I'm super high

1414
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:10,798
hit me up let's do it I got you brother

1415
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,358
thank you I'm gonna slide it and roll a

1416
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:15,559
joint yeah yeah please

1417
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:15,558
Peter which one should we do

1418
01:01:16,179 --> 01:01:19,309
[Music]

1419
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,099
let's do it

1420
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:27,900
so I noticed that everybody is there's

1421
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:30,239
nobody smoking like a bong

1422
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:32,700
oh yeah dude sometimes sometimes there

1423
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:35,098
is but that was always my favorite way

1424
01:01:32,699 --> 01:01:37,318
to smoke flour I actually started uh

1425
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:40,140
telling all my friends that come to FCP

1426
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:42,179
to bring a bong so from now on you'll

1427
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:44,159
probably start seeing some petty bongs I

1428
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:47,159
promise you that some sovereignty glass

1429
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:50,159
if I'm correct and then um

1430
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:52,500
I also always like vaporizing yeah dude

1431
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:54,358
I love my volcano volcano is cool but

1432
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,940
there's a there's a vaporizer in

1433
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:59,818
Amsterdam that I think is the best is it

1434
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:01,440
a sublimator it's called the the oh you

1435
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:04,940
just kind of threw me off I had it right

1436
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,920
on my [ __ ] tip of my tongue oh sorry

1437
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:11,119
for damper for damper that's called the

1438
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:14,338
verdamper yeah

1439
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:18,660
it's essentially like a hookah

1440
01:02:14,338 --> 01:02:20,940
but it's a vaporizer that sounds sick so

1441
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:22,618
um it doesn't have like a tube I mean

1442
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,440
some of them I guess maybe do have a

1443
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:29,338
hose but the traditional one is like a

1444
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,400
large glass apparatus where you kind of

1445
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:35,818
put a heating element that's all glass

1446
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:38,660
over a large bowl and it just sits over

1447
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:38,659
the top of it

1448
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,839
it's great I love it it's so smooth I

1449
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:49,400
loaded it with so much weed and it's

1450
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:51,480
just a perfectly groundnut [ __ ]

1451
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,240
I just wanted to show off the action

1452
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:56,900
yeah look at that it's rocking

1453
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:56,899
boom

1454
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:03,740
get yourself a Flour Mill

1455
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,740
on dagger Gardens

1456
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:10,799
and you cover it with your hand

1457
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,720
and then oh let it off like that to give

1458
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:15,659
it a carb and then

1459
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:17,578
um it's got a huge a huge bubble and

1460
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:20,519
then a big mouthpiece that comes off of

1461
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:22,619
it and you can order them and have them

1462
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:25,500
over here my friend has one here in the

1463
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:28,619
United States yeah but they're they're

1464
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:30,838
in almost every coffee shop and I love

1465
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:32,519
those they're really great vaporizers

1466
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:33,719
topic right now right now I'm in the

1467
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:34,630
middle of reading your book right now oh

1468
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:36,179
no

1469
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:38,818
[Music]

1470
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:40,798
right on I think I appreciate that so

1471
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:42,719
where are you in it literally on like

1472
