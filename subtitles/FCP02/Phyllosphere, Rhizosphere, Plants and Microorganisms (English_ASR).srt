1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,000
going to be a

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,678
interesting conversation tonight we're

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,440
going to talk about the phylosphere

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,120
and we'll probably get a little bit into

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,559
the rise of here rhizosphere

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,278
and we'll probably talk a little bit

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,679
about the regen conference this weekend

8
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,278
uh because that's where i am heading in

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,198
the morning so

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,759
uh definitely be talking about some of

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,679
the things going on uh this weekend

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,640
depending on how the show goes

13
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:38,320
hello nick

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
hey jason good evening

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,960
next week we're going to do because

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,879
you're not going to be here nick

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,799
i do have a a different guest coming

18
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,039
next week a gentleman by the name of

19
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,399
jesse and he's going to come and we're

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,079
going to talk about

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,558
hvac and

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,280
humidifying and dehumidifying and

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,399
why do humidifiers may not necessarily

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,399
be the right choice

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,640
especially if you're running ac because

26
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,639
they can be somewhat the same thing

27
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,319
interesting if i could join that one

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
actually i like the conversation around

29
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,039
environmental controls because

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,719
it seems like in most cases the physical

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,600
constraint that

32
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,640
large-scale operations run into is

33
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,519
their total dehumidification capacity so

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,040
yeah

35
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:37,359
yeah absolutely absolutely

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,439
too many things going on this week and

37
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:42,879
uh again getting ready for the regen

38
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:45,438
conference so i spent uh i spent an hour

39
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,039
going through seeds earlier

40
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,798
trying to pick packs of seeds to bring

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
with me to trade

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,439
uh

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,560
this weekend

44
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,639
and uh because there is a seed swap on

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,439
sunday

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,478
so

47
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:04,239
looking forward to that as well um

48
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:08,239
be good to trade some genetics and

49
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:11,840
see what uh what else is out there i've

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,360
got a lot of genetics

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
just going through stuff was kind of

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
crazy

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
trying to figure out you know what i

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
want to keep and

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,840
what i

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,840
may or may not actually get to

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,439
it's only so much room in the tent um

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,360
you know i think at my best run

59
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,000
let me let me go ahead and pull this up

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,040
i don't see any activity on

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,519
the fcp uh on the youtube side so let me

62
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,679
go ahead and pull this up but i uh

63
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
i was counting uh

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,640
you know how many cultivars i was

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,440
running a year and i think my

66
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,199
one of my better years

67
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,680
i think the most i did was uh let's see

68
00:02:54,199 --> 00:03:00,639
[Music]

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,000
21 different cultivars from 15 breeders

70
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,559
and

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,878
that was uh that was even a little bit

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,878
of a stretch so you know

73
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,479
25

74
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,959
plants

75
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,959
a year

76
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,359
um

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,560
at most i possibly could get away with

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
and

79
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,598
if you have 200 packs of seeds that's

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,599
eight years right there and that's just

81
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,318
you know if i ran one seed from every

82
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,759
one of those packs

83
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,958
you get to work that out for you for a

84
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,919
long period of time

85
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,080
i might just have to uh you know at some

86
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,158
point in time i've always had this uh

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,879
idea of just you know paying somebody to

88
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,079
borrow their facility for for a round

89
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,399
and

90
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,719
run as many of those seeds as possible

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,719
to see what to see what came out

92
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,119
although you know with all the

93
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,560
metric stuff it's kind of hard to see i

94
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,878
don't think anybody would actually let

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,280
me into the facility with all those

96
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,239
genetics because they have to be tagged

97
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,000
you know

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
they have to be entered into the system

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,840
before you can actually have them in the

100
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,239
facility legally

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,079
depending on the state yeah

102
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,918
correctability yeah exactly like you

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,759
said depending on the state in certain

104
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,439
states the traceability is

105
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,360
taken pretty seriously and in other

106
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,360
states uh that's true

107
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,758
maybe one of the newer states coming

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
online might be able to get away with it

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,560
under the radar

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,919
sneak them all in there

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,400
all right nothing from uh

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,439
either one of them

113
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,839
um so i'm gonna assume that the youtube

114
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,160
feed is a no-go for tonight which is uh

115
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:56,159
definitely cuts into some of our crowd

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,479
um and uh so i apologize there uh for

117
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,000
that and uh we'll we'll go ahead and

118
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,918
we'll uh you know we'll have our

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
conversation about uh

120
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,079
rhizosphere and phylosphere and this is

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,160
recorded here on clubhouse so

122
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,839
it is possible that uh they might be

123
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,199
able to do something with it and throw

124
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,599
it through the youtube

125
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,600
magic later on make it available

126
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,478
so uh rhizosphere and phylosphere so

127
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,680
let's go ahead and kick off with a

128
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:30,159
little introduction

129
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,639
you know the phylosphere is a term used

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,000
in microbiology to refer to the total

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,759
above ground surface of a plant

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,279
when viewed as a habitat for

133
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
microorganisms

134
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,478
the phylosphere can be further

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,079
subdivided into the colosphere which is

136
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,159
the stems

137
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,439
the phylloplane

138
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
the leaves

139
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,800
the anthosphere

140
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,080
the flowers

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,120
and the carbosphere which is the fruits

142
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:02,240
which is usually our favorite part of it

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,959
the below-grain microbial habitats

144
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,280
the thin volume soil surrounding the

145
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,318
roots of the subterranean stem surface

146
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,959
are referred to as the rhizosphere

147
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,960
and the llamosphere

148
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,279
most plants host diverse communities of

149
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,318
microorganisms including bacteria fungi

150
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,519
archaea and protists some are beneficial

151
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,560
to the plant

152
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,680
others

153
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,240
function as plant pathogens and may be

154
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,360
dangerous to the host or kill it

155
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
and

156
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,520
you know i think it's an interesting

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
topic to talk about the phylosphere

158
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,038
we've talked about

159
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,280
foliar

160
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,639
and we get into lots of conversations

161
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,599
around uh soil conditioning

162
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,439
and uh you know the soil health and the

163
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,199
soil food web

164
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,439
is a constant conversation but we don't

165
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,840
really talk about the phylosphere all

166
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,839
that much

167
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,680
leaf surface or the phylosphere harbors

168
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,519
a microbiome comprising diverse

169
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,360
communities of bacteria archaea and

170
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:15,279
fungi and algae and viruses um you know

171
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,439
i know

172
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,399
again we we talk a lot about the fungal

173
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,360
bodies and and you know the

174
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,318
the need to put um

175
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,560
good

176
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,840
things in your foliar sprays but you

177
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,519
know one of the things that i didn't

178
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,959
learn until recently was that you could

179
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,918
actually spray

180
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:37,038
predator nematodes

181
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,598
on as a foliar as well

182
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,639
and uh predator nematodes can actually

183
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,399
be

184
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,400
very productive in the phylosphere

185
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,198
in addition these environmental elements

186
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,520
affect plant physiology such as

187
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,919
photosynthesis respiration water uptake

188
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,240
etc and indirectly influence the

189
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,799
microbiome composition water and wind

190
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,598
also cause temporal variations to the

191
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,160
phylosphere microbiome

192
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,360
again getting back into talking about

193
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,800
insects and pests uh rain

194
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,759
uh

195
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,199
you know will knock a lot of pests off

196
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,520
of

197
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:28,000
a plant depending on the type of pest it

198
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:30,478
is um i know you know thrips are clumsy

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,679
they don't necessarily hang on really

200
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:36,479
well and uh blasting plants with water

201
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,478
is a great knock back technique you know

202
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,959
it's not gonna solve your problems but

203
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,560
it's a good way to kind of break down

204
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:47,359
some of those populations and

205
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:50,479
then coming in with uh you know some of

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,159
the predators and some of the sprays and

207
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
some of the other things that you you

208
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:58,399
could apply to help with uh

209
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,399
taking care of that issue

210
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,319
nixer

211
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,720
how are you doing tonight hey i'm doing

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,399
pretty well i'm doing well i just uh

213
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,680
kind of missed the usual introduction i

214
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,919
thought we were to get the welcome

215
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,000
welcome welcome and the whole uh

216
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,879
introductory spiel but we launched right

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,120
into it which i'm happy to do as well

218
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,879
yeah you know and you're right and i was

219
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,080
thinking about that part way through the

220
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,679
uh

221
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,278
as i was getting into the conversation

222
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,039
in the file sphere and obviously this

223
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,720
youtube thing is completely throwing my

224
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,039
game off tonight so

225
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,399

uh always happy to talk about hemp and

269
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,919
farming and growing

270
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,799
uh so

271
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:23,360
this uh week unfortunately we do not

272
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,679
seem to have our normal youtube feed as

273
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,759
i mentioned but we are recorded here on

274
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,759
clubhouse so if you do miss any of the

275
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,559
conversation and want to replay it later

276
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,720
please feel free to go back and uh

277
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,399
replay the show and

278
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,800
with that

279
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,320
um i want to remind everybody that this

280
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:45,359
is our thursday cultivation club we are

281
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,959
here every thursday at 9 00 pm eastern 6

282
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,079
p.m pacific time

283
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,359
to here to talk about the plant that we

284
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,479
love

285
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,278
uh ways to grow ways to care for it

286
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,240
ways to grow it occasionally ways to

287
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,838
consume it and you utilize it

288
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,440
although we tend to focus mostly on the

289
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,839
cultivation of the plants as well as the

290
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,120
different aspects of

291
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,959
chemistry

292
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,679
biochem and biology that are going on

293
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,000
within the plant and also around the

294
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:21,838
plant so thank you all for joining us

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,360
this week i do appreciate you being here

296
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,120
and for joining us every week actually

297
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,720
for all those who've joined us before

298
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,399
this is episode 28.

299
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,320
uh i believe and actually let me bring

300
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,200
up my list so that i get my numbers

301
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:40,560
right since i did not uh create my

302
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:43,519
script tonight uh we are on episode 27

303
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,679
excuse me and uh we are talking about

304
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,519
the phylosphere and the rhizosphere

305
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,679
tonight primarily that we're going to

306
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,399
focus on the phylosphere because as i

307
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,958
mentioned in the intro i don't think it

308
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,879
gets quite as much attention

309
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:01,759
uh as uh the rhizosphere we spent a lot

310
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:05,120
of time talking about the rhizosphere uh

311
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,120
things like the rhizophagic cycle and um

312
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,120
you know ways to uh

313
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,120
to help get uh improved soil biology and

314
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,959
fungal balances and things like that but

315
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,720
we don't really talk about the

316
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,278
phylosphere too much and i think that

317
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,839
was a a great idea to have that as a

318
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,399
topic tonight nick hosting me with me

319
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,240
tonight as always is my good friend nick

320
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,480
uh almost always because he's actually

321
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,320
not gonna be with us next week is my

322
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,839
good friend nick from the rooted leaf

323
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,720
how you doing tonight nick is that

324
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,480
better

325
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,079
it is it is it's much better i'm doing

326
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,959
great

327
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,359
about it

328
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,000
as you mentioned uh the phylosphere it's

329
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,480
kind of intriguing to me uh for a number

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,958
of reasons first and foremost because

331
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,680
um studying the phylosphere kind of

332
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,599
represents the latest and greatest in

333
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,958
like botanical understandings like when

334
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,800
you know people are studying plants and

335
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,399
they say well how do plants grow

336
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,559
one of the things that's kind of a hot

337
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,839
topic right now is looking in great

338
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,599
detail

339
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,360
at the phylosphere and examining some of

340
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,720
the microbial interactions and some of

341
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,800
the relationships

342
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
that happened up there so i thought it

343
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,078
would be interesting to kind of reflect

344
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,278
on a couple of points about the

345
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,439
phylosphere

346
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,600
uh and then make some references back to

347
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
the rhizosphere because there's some

348
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,199
sort of metaphorical stuff to understand

349
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,720
so i feel like a lot of the

350
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,078
people that are here right now listening

351
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,360
may already kind of intuitively

352
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,599
understand what happens in the

353
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,440
phylosphere but it's still nevertheless

354
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,278
uh going to be good for us to create

355
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,199
some of this connective tissue uh and

356
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,278
then also um you know there's actual

357
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,519
hard uh connections between the

358
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,039
rhizosphere and the phylosphere one of

359
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,679
the examples would be

360
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,799
uh mycorrhizal fungi

361
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,078
that funnel water you know to plants you

362
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,159
know when it goes up through their roots

363
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,399
and enters the leaf surface

364
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,480
a lot of times the microbial

365
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,839
relationships and populations in the

366
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,320
phylosphere can actually be dictated and

367
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,639
influenced uh is perhaps another more

368
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,800
adequate word it can be influenced by

369
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,278
um what's going on underground and and

370
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,159
the reverse is true as well that the

371
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,000
microbes and fungi in the phylosphere

372
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,679
um can kind of

373
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,399
you know create substances and modify

374
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,039
sugars produced by plants and then uh

375
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,839
release that you know back through

376
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,919
the phloem tissue out of the roots again

377
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,440
and during the night time the

378
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,078
the rhizosphere

379
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,399
organisms and inhabitants will sort of

380
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,519
you know feed on that so it's uh it's

381
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,000
kind of interesting because nothing's

382
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,278
really known in great detail except for

383
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,399
the one thing we do know for sure is

384
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,000
that we don't know anything for sure

385
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,000
it's like there's a lot of information

386
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
thornton is kind of a very hot topic so

387
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,958
yeah yeah looking forward to it

388
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,919
awesome awesome awesome i did just hear

389
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:46,559
back from london and um unfortunately he

390
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,399
had uh he had some personal stuff and is

391
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,119
just not available to do the feed

392
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,519
tonight so maybe peter will pop in and

393
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,198
we can get him on but unfortunately

394
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,759
london is not available tonight but

395
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,919
everything's okay so uh he's all good

396
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,959
but uh just not available to help us

397
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,278
with the youtube tonight so um yeah

398
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,039
let's go ahead and uh get back into it

399
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,838
you know i did talk about a couple of

400
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,000
points around the phylosphere uh to kick

401
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,040
it off right so you know talking about

402
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,078
the fact that it does harbor its own

403
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:21,278
microbiome uh which to me is is also

404
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:24,319
you know it's obvious when we talk about

405
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:28,159
we often compare the rhizosphere

406
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,480
uh to the stomach uh in humans right

407
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,000
there is a whole set of biology and

408
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,480
bacteria in your gut biome that is

409
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
responsible for helping you actually

410
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,600
digest the food

411
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,680
and and allowing you to get at those

412
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,199
elements and nutrients and

413
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,919
but similarly we also have our own kind

414
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,240
of phylosphere in our skin surface on

415
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,919
our skin surface is actually our largest

416
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,639
organ

417
00:16:53,919 --> 00:17:00,639
in the human body is the skin

418
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,440
and the skin is responsible for

419
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,240
you know all sorts of activity

420
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,199
both inhaling and exhaling

421
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,038
uh different types of chemicals and

422
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,600
signals and all sorts of different

423
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,679
things that happen in our skin surface

424
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,838
and there is a whole biome

425
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,919
and set of bacteria and things that run

426
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,678
around on our skin surfaces that also

427
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,439
help keep us healthy

428
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,280
and in some cases aren't necessarily

429
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,640
great for us as well

430
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:31,038
so it's similar and and should be of no

431
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,480
surprise that it's similar with plants

432
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,839
and plants have this whole

433
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,880
microbiome going on

434
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,759
that

435
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,520
is on the leaf surface not necessarily

436
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,759
all about what's going on under the

437
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,319
ground and it's not all

438
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,919
necessarily just about the stomata

439
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,558
either i think that's another thing that

440
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,000
we tend to focus on not so much about

441
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,879
all of those

442
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,279
different micro organisms so

443
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,280
you know the interactions between plants

444
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,200
and their associated microorganisms and

445
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,519
many of these microbiomes can play a

446
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,840
pivotal role in the host plant health as

447
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,839
i mentioned function and evolution

448
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,879
interactions between the host plant and

449
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:13,599
phylosphere bacteria have to have the

450
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,480
potential to drive various aspects of

451
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,798
the host plant physiology

452
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,558
however as of 2020

453
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,359
knowledge of these bacterial

454
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:27,279
associations in the phylosphere remain

455
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,279
relatively modest and there is a need to

456
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,319
advance fundamental knowledge of the

457
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,798
phylosphere biome dynamics again just

458
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,678
like you were saying nick not only are

459
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:37,359
we

460
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,600
kind of uh

461
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,798
just learning about what happens with

462
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,678
the phloem

463
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,960
and the movement of these things there's

464
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,679
also a lack of knowledge about how

465
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,279
this interaction works in the file

466
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,280
sphere

467
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,200
yeah yeah and to kind of piggyback off

468
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,359
that too it's interesting because in the

469
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,038
phylosphere at least

470
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,119
the changes that happen across the leaf

471
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,279
surface are a lot more dramatic and

472
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,879
they're a lot more intense it's a lot

473
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,798
more severe

474
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
in certain cases and microbes are

475
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,480
subject to a much higher degree of

476
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,400
oxidative stress particularly in

477
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
presence of the light so in a lot of

478
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,519
ways you know if you think about the

479
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,280
soil it's kind of like if you're a

480
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,879
microbe and you're a fungi that's kind

481
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,639
of the place to be because at least down

482
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,840
there there's resources and there's

483
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,000
shade and you can better resist

484
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:28,319
desiccation up on a leaf surface

485
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,160
and you have to deal with uh the harsh

486
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,599
conditions that are present on the leaf

487
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,558
surface which is you know dealing with

488
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,000
the air so it's high in oxygen it's you

489
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,519
know depending on the humidity you're

490
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,160
going to get desiccated pretty quick

491
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:43,119
there's intense and direct sunlight in

492
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,759
most cases so it's a lot more harsh of

493
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,439
an environment and to boot there's no

494
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,720
carbon substrate you're dealing with the

495
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,440
air so

496
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,319
very very limited resources overall very

497
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,880
limited water nutrients very high

498
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,159
probability of desiccation and oxidative

499
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,240
stress

500
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,159
so in a lot of ways the phylosphere is

501
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,159
like the ultimate conditioner for

502
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,919
microbes that can survive

503
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,520
pretty stressful environments and you

504
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,120
know if you zoom in under a microscope

505
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,119
you can kind of see like

506
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,959
these these microbes they're buttered up

507
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,399
right next to plant cells you know

508
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,159
they're kind of sharing the same space

509
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,559
they're occupying the same

510
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,120
more or less like square centimeter um

511
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,038
in fact i think if you took like one

512
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,119
square centimeter of any leaf surface

513
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,038
you know if it's really healthy you're

514
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,879
gonna have hundreds of thousands

515
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,720
potentially even millions of different

516
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,559
bacillus species and then you may you

517
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,640
may have tens of thousands if not

518
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,558
hundreds of thousands of beneficial

519
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,799
fungi um hopefully hopefully they're

520
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,079
beneficial um but the other reason the

521
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,158
phylosphere is kind of interesting

522
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,558
besides that is uh you know you look at

523
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,559
the overall surface area of just like

524
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,079
hey i wonder how much surface area is

525
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,678
occupied by all of the leaves on this

526
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,678
planet it's kind of like a you know

527
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,280
crazy hypothetical question but think

528
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,280
about it there's a very large surface

529
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,879
area that makes up this space we're

530
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,119
calling the phylosphere so the right

531
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,280
microbes if they get into the space they

532
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,798
occupy this massive surface area across

533
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,240
the whole planet they can kind of

534
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,240
eventually

535
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
start to you know

536
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,599
form their own specialized functions

537
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,280
over time

538
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,959
and this is something that's

539
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,240
i think going to start to be more and

540
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,880
more evidenced

541
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,038
that there are distinct microbes that

542
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
exist just in the phylosphere

543
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,798
then there's overlapping microbes that

544
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,400
exist kind of both in the phylosphere

545
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,798
and the rhizosphere

546
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,320
and then all you know also uh there's

547
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,038
microbes that exist just in the

548
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,439
rhizosphere and have not yet been found

549
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,279
in the phylosphere so it's interesting

550
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,360
to see this dynamic at play and like i

551
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,359
said part of it is just the intense

552
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,558
environment and the conditions that are

553
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,158
present

554
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,879
i also think the phylosphere gets a

555
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,640
pretty bad rap overall because most of

556
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,440
the studies that have been done on polar

557
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,360
surfaces have been from the context of

558
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,960
dealing with pathogenic fungi which is

559
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,959
kind of casting

560
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,640
the delicate and nuanced

561
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,120
nature of the phylosphere in a weird

562
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,880
light when you're only studying it

563
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,719
because there's a disease present and

564
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,320
there's imbalance presence so when

565
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,679
people kind of go in and start learning

566
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,918
about the phytosphere one of the most

567
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,759
immediate things is like oh you want to

568
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,520
keep that as a sterile environment you

569
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,038
want to kill everything on it you wanted

570
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,558
to be perfectly clean and you wanted to

571
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:15,200
be spotless and you know at the end of

572
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:16,798
the day

573
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,519
powdery mildew

574
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,960
yeah yeah yeah so you know like you have

575
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,519
an imbalance in something that's

576
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,600
happening and that you know may lead to

577
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,879
an over correction and i think that in a

578
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,639
really healthy

579
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,799
environment your phylosphere is going to

580
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,480
be strong just like your rhizospheres

581
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,720
that's going to be able to um out

582
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,519
compete any of the pathogens that are

583
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,480
trying to get in so yeah

584
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:43,519
yeah um yeah the um

585
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,200
yeah the the the phylosphere micro

586
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,519
uh microbes

587
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,038
uh from different plants uh from what i

588
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,359
was reading

589
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:56,558
um is uh you know they're somewhat

590
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:59,839
similar um in uh at the high levels of

591
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:02,720
the taxa but at lower levels

592
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,720
there's uh different signific there's

593
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,919
some significant differences between the

594
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
plants so

595
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,520
you know as you were saying the

596
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,880
environment has a big effect on it

597
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:15,759
so whatever the you know the micro

598
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,159
biome of the environment is

599
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:21,119
has a big impact on the types of

600
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,919
microbes that exist in that environment

601
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,839
overall and at a higher level and at a

602
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,919
you know macro level when you look at

603
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,839
you know the the groupings and stuff a

604
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,759
lot of it's the same even between

605
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,519
different plants because they're just

606
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,440
all over the environment

607
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,119
and um but when you get down to the you

608
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,440
know to the individual leaf surfaces

609
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,038
onto each of these individual plants

610
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,038
that's where you start to see some of

611
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,119
the specialization and as you were

612
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,359
saying in certain cases where they've

613
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,038
created an interaction or there's

614
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,879
certain cases where the plant is

615
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:55,359
producing uh compounds that tend to push

616
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,520
those bacterial things away

617
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,918
like in cannabis you know terpenes are

618
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,599
one of those things that are used

619
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,360
to help protect the plant that it

620
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,839
releases in

621
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,719
in a way to help drive things away from

622
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,879
it that are are bad for it so uh it's

623
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,278
it's interesting that uh as you were

624
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,559
saying that the you know the environment

625
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,119
does have an

626
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,558
effect on it and and but you do have

627
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,879
these different

628
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,158
micro interactions not just what's in

629
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,440
the larger

630
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,000
uh macro environment and um

631
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,080
you know the types of communities the

632
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,440
balance of those communities is also

633
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,879
different depending on the types of

634
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
regions you're in

635
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,000
and

636
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:40,399
so you will have a larger

637
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,640
you know a larger makeup of

638
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,679
fungal bacterial

639
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,038
in a jungle in tropical regions and a

640
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,120
lot less in a temperate region

641
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,599
or you're going to have less diversity

642
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,278
in a temperate region and more diversity

643
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,119
in a jungle region

644
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,839
because you have more diverse plant

645
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,000
species and animal species you probably

646
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,959
also by association gonna have a

647
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,720
more you know diverse fungal community

648
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,360
and bacterial community within those

649
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,960
leaf surfaces

650
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,639
yeah yeah and everything you've said

651
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,558
there over the past couple of minutes

652
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,960
actually interestingly enough applies to

653
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,359
tea pretty well because there is a style

654
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,798
of tea called pure that is aged and

655
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,798
fermented with

656
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,038
microbes and if you look in the

657
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,400
literature you can see uh you know

658
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,200
several studies have been done to

659
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,120
identify what is the microbiome and you

660
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,480
know what species of microbes and fungi

661
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,399
are present and everything you just said

662
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,720
right down to talking about you know

663
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,320
jungle like regions that have you know

664
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,400
even if there's changes in humidity

665
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,639
changes in altitude things like this um

666
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,960
the degree of oxidation of

667
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,200
the tea leaf obviously plays a big role

668
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,798
in and there's two distinct styles of

669
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,440
processing poor but you know without

670
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,879
getting too far into it the premise is

671
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,278
overall that

672
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,039
you know microbes and fungi these are

673
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,880
organisms that are highly active in leaf

674
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,640
surfaces and you know if you look

675
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,400
specifically at

676
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,278
puerto it's basically just tea that's

677
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,679
been harvested you know uh dried in the

678
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,038
sun and then processed uh you know

679
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,798
further dehydrated sometimes it's

680
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,798
pressed into a cake otherwise it's you

681
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,319
know kept loose but the idea is that

682
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,558
these microbes will continue to age on

683
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,798
the leaf surface for uh decades and the

684
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,960
longer that you let them age

685
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,960
the more potent the flavor of the tea

686
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,480
becomes and so it's like it's almost

687
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,159
like the plants are producing certain

688
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,240
metabolites that are going to get

689
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,720
unlocked over very long periods of time

690
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,720
and certainly gore is one of those

691
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,720
uh luxuries that you know if you can

692
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,919
afford something that's 30 or 40 years

693
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,440
old

694
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,919
it's going to be you know one heck of an

695
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,080
experience um but it's interesting you

696
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,759
know to to also think that for cannabis

697
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:46,798
plants there are perhaps microbes and

698
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,240
fungi that um you know participate in

699
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,000
very complex

700
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,159
uh interactions on the leaf surface to

701
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,400
maybe deter pests you know to keep

702
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,080
disease pressures at bay and ultimately

703
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,159
maybe in some more realistic or

704
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,119
practical environments

705
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,278
uh

706
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,079
deal with light intensity or to deal

707
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:06,000
with dehydration you know things of that

708
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,558
nature biotic and abiotic stress i think

709
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,880
is a is a big factor at least for you

710
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,639
know commercial cannabis producers and

711
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,039
um you know that being said if you're

712
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,278
also growing uh medicinally you know

713
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,480
having that uh population of microbes

714
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,119
and fungi

715
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,360
in check also i think improves the

716
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,199
sort of nutritional value of your plants

717
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,798
overall if you do things like juice you

718
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,399
know with the leaves and also the

719
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,038
therapeutic qualities of the flowers

720
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,798
because you get those broader spectrum

721
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,158
metabolites produced by the cannabis

722
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,000
plants you know particularly because

723
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,720
they had these interactions with the

724
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,119
microbes and fungi you know i think a

725
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,480
lot of times it's easier you know easy

726
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,398
to forget that when plants produce

727
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,720
secondary metabolites it's in response

728
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,839
to something and sometimes that response

729
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,440
can be

730
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,079
mediated by a relationship that's

731
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,240
present on a leaf surface or within the

732
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,000
roots in the rhizosphere so yeah these

733
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,278
things ultimately come together to kind

734
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,079
of create the

735
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,759
you know broad spectrum flavor profiles

736
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,158
that we all know and love cannabis to

737
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,158
produce

738
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:10,720
yeah and uh like even interestingly

739
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:16,479
enough those microorganisms themselves

740
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:18,399
have to even adjust their own um biology

741
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,480
to their metabolic you know they have to

742
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,798
adjust their metabolic uh rates and

743
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,480
stuff to be able to survive

744
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,038
in many cases in some of these

745
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,120
environments because they can be harsh

746
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:34,158
uh for for bacterial bodies um

747
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:36,158
and so they they need to uh even adjust

748
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,600
themselves so that they can survive be

749
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,440
more five uh finely tuned to survive on

750
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,439
that specific surface and i imagine it's

751
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,759
the same case with especially something

752
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,278
like cannabis that kicks out so many

753
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:52,558
uh different types of uh terpenes and

754
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:55,759
uh esters and and all sorts of uh

755
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,359
different types of chemicals

756
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,679
yeah and you know it's interesting that

757
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,158
you know um a lot of like the active

758
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,320
pesticide ingredients are actually uh in

759
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,480
some cases derivatives of

760
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,079
um microbes that might actually be

761
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,519
present on the leaf surface like there's

762
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,960
a bacillus subtilis qst 713 strain that

763
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,398
i think is called cease is the

764
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,519
commercialized name

765
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:16,719
um

766
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,558
and then there's also other products

767
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,079
that feature enzymes

768
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:21,839
uh you know they're derived from the

769
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,119
exact same species

770
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,959
so it's very interesting you know

771
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,439
because you can take that approach which

772
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,960
has shown efficacy you know it's it's uh

773
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,480
it's good to take a biological route

774
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,679
like that but it also kind of raises the

775
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,960
question of

776
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,519
you know well i wonder if we can do

777
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,558
something to set up the chemical

778
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,798
um

779
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,960
you know equilibrium in the phylosphere

780
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,519
such that these microbes

781
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,679
uh have access to resources that they

782
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,639
need to you know have healthy amounts of

783
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,320
populations and prevent these infections

784
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,038
from happening so that we have you know

785
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,798
we're not so reliant on taking reactive

786
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,398
approaches but rather we can take

787
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,599
preventative approaches through good

788
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,599
cultivation

789
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,599
sops you know having this understanding

790
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,439
of taking care of the soil and taking

791
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,839
care of the roots i think you know the

792
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,519
more growers focus on that the better

793
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,599
they become at growing healthier plants

794
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,038
and so it also kind of stands to reason

795
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,879
that if you understand

796
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,038
the complex dynamic of what's happening

797
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,200
in the leaf surface and you strive to

798
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,720
improve the quality of the air and

799
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,480
improve the quality of the environment

800
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,919
in that leaf surface

801
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,880
for your plants i think you're also

802
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,038
going to see

803
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,640
similar results as far as being able to

804
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,158
improve the quality

805
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,759
of the flower that you're growing the

806
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,120
extract that you're making and the

807
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,119
overall health of your plants

808
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,599
absolutely absolutely

809
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,960
it's uh it's really

810
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:47,278
it's interesting to think about

811
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,278
um

812
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,320
making applications to support the

813
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,240
protobacteria the bacteria diets the

814
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,398
actinobacteria

815
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,240
uh all the different types of species or

816
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,000
at least supporting the types of ones

817
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,079
that are going to be the most helpful

818
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,919
and productive

819
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,839
you know some of those bacillus species

820
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,480
are definitely known

821
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,240
to be helpful in both the rhizosphere as

822
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,798
well as the phylosphere

823
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,798
you know we we talk a lot about lab

824
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:23,839
lactic acid bacteria is a very very good

825
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:27,038
uh foliar as well it's it's uh fantastic

826
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,319
many many old school growers have been

827
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,519
known to

828
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,720
dump milk on their plants to help

829
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,480
fight

830
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,558
powdery mildew

831
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,720
and that's because the lactic acid

832
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:41,440
bacteria in the milk

833
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,399
is helping uh counteract some of the

834
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,960
powdery mildew and helping

835
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:50,798
create a better core

836
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,640
microbiome for the for the plant

837
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:53,279
yeah yeah and a lot of times for plants

838
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
the um

839
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,720
[Music]

840
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,440
the ability to resist

841
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,038
disease pressures like pathogens is

842
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,880
actually something that's mediated by

843
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,679
other microbes other microbes like

844
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,640
lactobacillus acidophilus which i think

845
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,519
is the

846
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,840
lab culture that you're talking about

847
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,960
those will produce compounds that will

848
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:17,839
destroy the cell walls of pathogens and

849
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,480
they uh interestingly enough don't do

850
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,240
that in all cases but when

851
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,798
certain species like pseudomonas for

852
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,960
example that genus of microbes can be

853
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,599
plant pathogenic and so

854
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,440
often times if you have the correct

855
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,678
species profile you've got good

856
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,200
diversity of bacillus species they can

857
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,399
actually

858
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,240
uh help sort of prevent that pseudomonas

859
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,119
from can you know infecting the plants

860
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,480
and producing harmful substances

861
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,158
that's the part that's a little bit

862
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,759
unknown and you know again this is a

863
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,919
very complex

864
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,879
thing to try to monitor because

865
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,880
you know

866
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,399
it's so it requires such delicate

867
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,720
instrumentation just to be able to

868
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:57,918
observe even for very very small periods

869
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,720
of time

870
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,200
what's going on and what exactly

871
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,880
is allowing certain microbes to

872
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,200
mediate the interaction that other

873
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,519
microbes have with plants and if they

874
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,440
don't get along well with the plant then

875
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,679
they basically can get their cytoplasm

876
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,440
blown out um you know this is kind of

877
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,600
more specifically how

878
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,120
uh some of these compounds work is they

879
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,439
they do things like they denature the

880
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:24,239
cell wall so they allow for the leakage

881
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,240
of the internal guts of you know the the

882
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,839
microbes to come out and then

883
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,599
subsequently get oxidized and all the

884
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,959
dna gets destroyed so it's a very

885
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,678
effective way

886
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,880
um of of killing something else um and

887
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,120
then on the flip side too there's

888
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,760
something uh along the lines of they

889
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,959
produce like sugars these

890
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:43,038
exopolysaccharides that

891
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,679
sort of uh make little biofilms very

892
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,519
microscopic biofilms and these biofilms

893
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,159
will actually prevent they're like a

894
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,480
little protective layer uh

895
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,240
that prevents other microbes from coming

896
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,399
in and physically attaching to the plant

897
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,319
cells so you can have

898
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,918
a disease pressure present in the

899
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,519
environment

900
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,919
but that disease pressure is going to be

901
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,079
unable to actually interact with the

902
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,759
plant and infect it and get inside

903
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,319
because this biofilm formed by the

904
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,079
protective beneficial microbe in the

905
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,000
phytosphere uh

906
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,599
you know it did its job and it prevented

907
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,519
the bad guys from coming in and stealing

908
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,519
all the resources and robbing the bank

909
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:20,519
basically

910
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:29,199
yeah uh bio film is um

911
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,918
is a really interesting topic in itself

912
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,918
hey peter how you doing tonight

913
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,358
oh good i had no idea we wanted to go

914
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,559
live tonight

915
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:40,719
yeah yeah i i apologize i was not good

916
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,320
at advertising this week but we are

917
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,878
going to try to stay consistent and show

918
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,639
up every thursday so

919
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,358
all right well i'll uh

920
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,240
i'll grab this after and we'll put it up

921
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:55,039
on youtube but uh carry on yeah i

922
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,358
appreciate that and i apologize for my

923
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,320
lack of pre-notification to keep

924
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:03,199
everybody in line that's my job i'm a

925
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,160
project manager i should know better

926
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,960
and um so anyway

927
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:11,440
thank you and and uh again uh you know i

928
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,639
hope uh everything is uh sending

929
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,760
positive vibe london's way i i uh

930
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:20,000
and uh he's our usual co-pilot for the

931
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,040
evening as well i'm sure you're in the

932
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,119
middle of dinner uh probably with your

933
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:30,759
in-laws or you're in the middle of

934
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,760
cooking something no i'm cooking uh yeah

935
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,320
fantastic fantastic well thank you for

936
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,079
being here and since we are uh past the

937
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,280
half hour mark we'll go ahead and

938
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,200
re-light the room and then we'll talk

939
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,839
we'll get back to that conversation

940
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:46,879
about biofilm i was just about to to

941
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:50,639
mention um so this is hot herbs grow and

942
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,760
tell we are here every thursday night

943
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,639
every thursday night whether i notify

944
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,640
people or not

945
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,519
at 9 00 pm eastern 6 p.m pacific

946
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,599
uh

947
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:08,239
we are uh available and usually uh

948
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,400
recorded in simulcast on youtube on the

949
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,598
future cannabis project fcpo2 channel

950
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,039
and as peter said later on folks will be

951
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,280
able to go ahead and re-listen to this

952
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:22,079
through youtube or as you know you can

953
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,599
also re-listen to it here in uh

954
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,200
clubhouse if you feel it necessary to

955
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,000
check back in on some of the things that

956
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,919
we covered already tonight

957
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,199
and as i said the folks in the room

958
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,119
tonight you get the exclusive live

959
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,118
version everybody else it's just a

960
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,880
replay for tonight

961
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,280
uh if you haven't already make sure you

962
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,000
click on the little greenhouse and join

963
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,720
the future cannabis project and uh hit

964
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,639
the you know hit the little bell so that

965
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,959
every time there's something going on

966
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,759
you'll be notified

967
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,880
so uh back to it so as i was about to

968
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,960
say biofilm is is actually a topic in

969
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,640
itself and it's actually something

970
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,639
lighten talks about so i'm not sure if

971
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,960
he's actually done a future cannabis

972
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,039
project on it already peter

973
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,240
but biofilm is definitely a topic i know

974
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:15,679
light likes to talk about and it's um

975
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:17,679
you know biofilm is a very natural

976
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:21,039
occurring thing i think people

977
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:24,879
think about it uh in a negative way

978
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,880
because it does uh it's the slimy stuff

979
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,960
a lot of the time right

980
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,800
but biofilm is actually one of the

981
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,920
reasons why

982
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,839
natural child birth is actually better

983
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,720
than

984
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:41,039
caesarean because of the biofilm and all

985
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,679
of the other things that come out as

986
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,480
part of the natural childbirth and so a

987
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:49,118
lot of time we think about these slimy

988
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,000
biofilms and things like that as a bad

989
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,440
thing but in many cases they're a really

990
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,760
good and productive thing um you know in

991
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,320
vinegars a lot of vinegars if you have a

992
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,400
good vinegar that has a mother you'll

993
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,519
get a um slimy rubbery

994
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,639
kind of

995
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:11,280
biofilm buildup on top and that's that

996
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,598
mother and that's actually a living

997
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,960
biological soup

998
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,440
that is

999
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,159
part of the fermentation process and as

1000
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,920
part of that living body

1001
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,039
uh that's in there so if you ever get

1002
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,039
like a bottle of dr bragg's

1003
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,320
apple cider vinegar or something like

1004
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,239
that you

1005
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,960
let that puppy sit out you're going to

1006
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,118
get that kind of biofilm starts to form

1007
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,400
on it and that's the mother what they

1008
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,440
call the mother and you'll see on the

1009
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,200
label vinegar with mother and it means

1010
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,880
that there is some of that in there to

1011
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,838
help kind of form that really cool

1012
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,800
bio

1013
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:48,799
or biofilm

1014
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,519
yeah that biofilm is interesting too

1015
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,839
because you know like i mentioned

1016
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,440
earlier if you just consider how harsh

1017
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:00,078
the phylosphere is

1018
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,920
as an environment it does a good job of

1019
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,280
you know conditioning the microbes that

1020
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,358
can resist major swings and fluctuations

1021
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,599
uh in temperature and humidity and light

1022
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,920
intensity um

1023
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,838
so it kind of stands to reason that part

1024
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,358
of you know the the evolutionary

1025
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,759
advantage of

1026
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,159
biofilms may actually be in creating a

1027
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,760
more stable environment for the microbes

1028
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,000
and certainly enough if you kind of look

1029
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,000
more specifically at some of the

1030
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,280
properties and some of the benefits that

1031
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,760
these biofilms have they do help offset

1032
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,000
some of the stressors of dehydration for

1033
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,079
example or desiccation which is very

1034
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,920
common in the leaf surface

1035
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,240
whereas in the roots ideally you know

1036
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,000
the microbes that are in the roots don't

1037
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,559
have to deal with dehydration or

1038
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,880
desiccation stress nearly as much

1039
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,960
and then furthermore because it's also

1040
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,119
a nutrient deplete environment you know

1041
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,800
the phytosphere is not the soil there's

1042
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,519
no minerals you know there's there's no

1043
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,680
nutrients present the microbes have to

1044
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,920
do with very very little and so part of

1045
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:02,960
the benefit of these biofilms is that

1046
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,680
they can act as many nutrient stores

1047
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,760
uh for microbes and so they can you know

1048
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,078
be accessed at later times to help pull

1049
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,599
out certain resources while at the same

1050
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,519
time they can kind of

1051
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,079
you know act like sponges to soak up

1052
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,039
extra water and help store that so as

1053
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,119
the

1054
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,719
environment around the microbes changes

1055
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,480
very rapidly

1056
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,399
they've got a little bit of a buffer

1057
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,079
that they've built up to kind of help

1058
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,680
you know deal with that um

1059
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,079
like jason said that the topic of

1060
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,598
biofilms is pretty complex it's one word

1061
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,280
but it actually

1062
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,519
uh refers to

1063
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,519
you know probably a variety of different

1064
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:41,199
actual distinct sugars uh you know in

1065
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,599
perhaps the architecture of the way that

1066
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,118
those sugars are linked together is also

1067
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,519
something to consider just like if we're

1068
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,559
talking about humic acids or fulvic

1069
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,960
acids

1070
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,639
the three-dimensional shape of a humic

1071
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,639
versus the three-dimensional shape of a

1072
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,078
fulvic almost defines the differences

1073
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,039
between them even though they come from

1074
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,800
the same parent material so in a similar

1075
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,039
way i think there's

1076
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,200
the structure of you know some of these

1077
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,559
biofilms is something that

1078
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,078
you know could be examined at great

1079
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,440
length so this is definitely an

1080
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,839
interesting topic we won't get too far

1081
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,000
into it but the biofilms that are formed

1082
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,599
on the phylosphere uh are definitely

1083
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,679
formidable because they have to you know

1084
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,880
regulate these massive swings and all

1085
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:21,838
kinds of different environmental

1086
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,838
parameters

1087
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,800
oh caught me away from my mute button

1088
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:33,680
[Laughter]

1089
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,200
you know and and you know i was

1090
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,440
as i was reading through some of the

1091
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:40,799
stuff on this interestingly enough

1092
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,318
um you know just similarly there is i

1093
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,359
know we don't think about it but there

1094
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,440
is also a phylosphere on

1095
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,679
marine plants

1096
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,079
they also have a phylosphere and they

1097
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:55,440
also have the same

1098
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,800
types of epiphytic bacteria that's found

1099
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,200
in the marine environment and

1100
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,400
exists on that surfaces and i imagine

1101
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,879
they could not exist on those surfaces

1102
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,559
without a biofilm that would allow them

1103
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,880
to attach in those extreme environments

1104
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,719
i mean talk about being in an extreme

1105
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,800
environment

1106
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,239
probably more moisture as you were

1107
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,560
saying earlier they don't necessarily

1108
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,639
have to worry as much about drying out

1109
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,318
although the the effect of the salt

1110
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,920
waters on their

1111
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:30,000
uh bodies might be interesting but in

1112
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,680
the uh in the marine environment they

1113
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,318
have a ro they're thought to have a role

1114
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,159
in the nitrogen cycle so

1115
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,119
um you know without

1116
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,679
uh

1117
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,358
epiphytic bacteria

1118
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,598
playing a role

1119
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,920
you might not necessarily be getting as

1120
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,359
much nitrogen in

1121
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,838
marine plants

1122
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,000
they're not able to pull that you know

1123
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,519
atmospheric nitrogen out that our

1124
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,920
land-based plants

1125
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:56,920
love to utilize

1126
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,960
yeah yeah the sea plants are are

1127
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,639
interesting you know they uh do it's

1128
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,519
interesting because i think there are

1129
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:07,759
some

1130
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,440
um you know there's some differences but

1131
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,440
there's also some similarities in the

1132
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,639
microbial populations that you can find

1133
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
on

1134
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,118
sea plants and versus land plants too

1135
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,559
and in a lot of cases you know the seed

1136
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,318
plants are producing

1137
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,599
certain types of sugars that do a really

1138
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,159
good job at

1139
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,838
resisting dehydration stress in case you

1140
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,440
know during high tide they get smashed

1141
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:28,960
up on a rock and it starts to turn to

1142
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,480
low tide and you know they don't get

1143
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,480
pulled back in the water

1144
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,880
um a lot of sea plants basically have to

1145
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,559
deal with being totally dehydrated after

1146
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,000
being completely submerged

1147
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,239
you know for hours and hours and hours

1148
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,599
on end and rapid changes in humidity and

1149
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,159
salinity so

1150
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,440
part of this complex soup of metabolites

1151
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:46,960
that are being produced in the cell

1152
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,760
walls of

1153
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,159
uh

1154
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,839
aquatic plants um you know there is

1155
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,239
overlap with

1156
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,400
the the microbial species you know and

1157
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,159
in terms of some of the enzymes that are

1158
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,800
being produced by these species of

1159
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:02,000
microbes and with the land plants too uh

1160
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,440
it's interesting if you look at some of

1161
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,039
the epiphytes like the some of the

1162
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,720
bacillus species

1163
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,480
in the phylosphere of land plants you

1164
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,078
see that they actually produce compounds

1165
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,519
that help recycle

1166
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,519
cell walls and so they have like

1167
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:14,639
cellulase enzymes for instance to help

1168
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,480
break down

1169
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:17,838
old dead cell material just like in the

1170
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,679
roots we know that there are some

1171
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:21,599
beneficial microbes that

1172
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,039
will help break down old dead root

1173
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,039
material and convert it back into

1174
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,119
soluble sugars and

1175
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,358
feed younger plants and help them create

1176
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,960
new root materials so this process of

1177
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,039
recycling

1178
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,880
uh is kind of interesting to point out

1179
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,039
that the same thing also exists in the

1180
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,960
phylosphere and there's uh interestingly

1181
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,358
enough similar if not the same microbes

1182
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,679
that participate in the same way it's

1183
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:46,799
very fascinating

1184
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,799
yeah it's really cool

1185
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,160
i was i just kept

1186
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,079
digging deeper deeper down different

1187
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,358
uh rabbit holes while i was reading

1188
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,800
reading through some of this because

1189
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,519
again

1190
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,960
most of my focus and a lot of the things

1191
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,280
that i've read about

1192
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,800
uh tend to focus on the soil the

1193
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,800
rhizosphere

1194
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,920
how do we get you know how do we improve

1195
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,400
the fungal and the bacterial bodies and

1196
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,400
how do those interactions work and all

1197
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,000
those things again we

1198
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,680
don't necessarily focus too much on the

1199
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,480
types of bacterial and fungal

1200
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,759
life that exists on the leaf surface and

1201
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,960
so it's definitely something that's

1202
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,000
important

1203
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,079
bio biofilm is also

1204
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,880
you know important again talking about

1205
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,079
the rhizosphere biofilm is what helps

1206
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:41,599
put together those fantastic uh you know

1207
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:44,800
underground uh combinations of of

1208
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:49,599
bacterial bodies and biofilm and things

1209
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:52,800
that help create actual soil structure

1210
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,680
so having having those um comp those

1211
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,318
aggregates come together

1212
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:01,440
is what helps create really really good

1213
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:04,318
soil structure um it's one of the things

1214
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,159
that as those uh you know get deeper and

1215
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:09,039
deeper and deeper into the soil they

1216
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:12,159
help with the channeling of water and

1217
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:15,039
help you know reduce

1218
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,759
runoff and flooding if you have really

1219
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:20,639
really great deep aggregation of your

1220
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,119
soil with all of these little tiny you

1221
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,719
know when you if you pull up a plant and

1222
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,318
you see all the roots are hanging down

1223
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,039
and there's those little clumps and

1224
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:31,440
balls of dirt well that's all because of

1225
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,440
the biofilm and the bio slime there's

1226
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,200
things going on there with the bacterial

1227
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,480
life that's happening that's a sign of

1228
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,480
really good healthy soil

1229
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,359
yeah again so much is dependent on this

1230
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,400
you know communication of information

1231
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,239
between

1232
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,480
the leaf surface of a plant and what's

1233
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,399
going on directly underneath it because

1234
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,000
a lot of times um

1235
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,119
you know they have to inform each other

1236
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,679
otherwise there's going to be a little

1237
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,838
bit of a an imbalance in in the growth

1238
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,919
overall so it sort of stands to reason

1239
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,279
that a lot of times the microbes that

1240
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,639
are going to be present in the roots are

1241
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,960
also present

1242
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,118
uh in the leaf surface

1243
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,679
and i think you know maybe a more

1244
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,039
uh sort of common example of something

1245
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,118
like that would be

1246
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,599
i think a few years ago maybe 10 or 15

1247
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,720
or 20 years ago even by now

1248
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,720
um

1249
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,118
you know there were some studies done on

1250
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:25,439
uh how trees in a you know deciduous

1251
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,800
trees in a forest were connected through

1252
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,720
mycorrhizal

1253
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,160
relationships and they basically noticed

1254
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,598
that if they applied something to the

1255
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:32,719
leaf surface or if there was some kind

1256
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,880
of stress

1257
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,039
induced in the leaf surface of one of

1258
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,200
the species that the message would

1259
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:42,000
somehow get transferred down

1260
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,919
to the mycorrhizae you know past i mean

1261
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,519
this is like in the actual ground it's

1262
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,200
you know outside of the plant at this

1263
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,559
point and then that signal goes to a

1264
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,719
different plant

1265
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,480
and the plant itself is capable of

1266
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,959
responding in its own leaf surface by

1267
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,199
producing some volatile organic compound

1268
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,119
or it has a change in the expression of

1269
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,639
secondary metabolites you know now all

1270
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,800
of a sudden this plant is producing

1271
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,879
something to ward off the exact same

1272
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,318
thing that this other plant is you know

1273
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,000
being contaminated with or being

1274
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,599
attacked by um

1275
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,800
so you know it's very interesting to

1276
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,480
watch how

1277
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,400
the this signal is preserved across

1278
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,599
uh you know a variety of very harsh

1279
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,280
environments

1280
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,640
uh in a variety of different kingdoms

1281
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,119
you know it starts off with maybe a

1282
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,960
microbe or a fungi in the leaf surface

1283
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,640
you know gets mediated by the plant

1284
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,800
presumably somehow

1285
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,639
it interfaces with the plants phloem

1286
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,839
gets loaded up inside of it takes a

1287
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,719
little ride down through the phloem

1288
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:36,639
tissue gets pushed out of the roots and

1289
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,480
microbes and fungi there

1290
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,719
um you know kind of

1291
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,639
pick that signal up and and they can

1292
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,159
make changes with other plants that

1293
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:48,759
they're connected to so it's a very very

1294
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:48,759
interesting concept yeah

1295
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:54,960
so and you know to complement what we've

1296
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,119
um you know

1297
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:01,199
i know complementing the you know

1298
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:04,318
rhizophagic cycle there's also a similar

1299
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:07,039
cycle that goes on with

1300
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:09,679
sienna bacteria

1301
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:12,480
being able to

1302
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:14,239
basically enter the plant through the

1303
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,838
stomata

1304
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,959
and colonize that intercellular space

1305
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:21,799
forming

1306
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,159
uh loops and uh inter

1307
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,160
intracellular coils

1308
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:31,480
um so again

1309
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,480
this interaction with the bacteria

1310
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:35,920
actually coming into the plant itself i

1311
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,160
know

1312
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,159
when i first started learning about

1313
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,960
the soil food web it was you know the

1314
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:44,799
bacteria they eat the soil and the

1315
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,280
things in the soil the out to the

1316
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,200
elements the raw elements and convert

1317
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,040
them over to this

1318
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:55,279
uh inter you know the into this uh form

1319
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,000
that's readily uh acceptable to the

1320
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,440
plant that the plant is available and

1321
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
can absorb it

1322
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,599
but it's not just that right it's

1323
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,838
actually deeper where some of these

1324
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:11,760
microorganisms and bacteria are actually

1325
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:14,159
coming into the plants cellular walls as

1326
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,720
part of this process and then being

1327
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:19,920
expunged back out to restart the cycle

1328
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:23,838
again and similarly there's some there's

1329
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:27,920
a similar interaction going on in both

1330
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:29,599
the rhizosphere and the phylosphere

1331
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,039
yeah yeah and i'm glad you you know you

1332
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,280
brought that cycle up because it's

1333
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,558
something that um

1334
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:39,119
uh you know sort of shows how plants can

1335
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,880
mediate and condition

1336
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,720
the interactions that they have with

1337
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,200
microbes around them there are certain

1338
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,358
examples where microbes effectively have

1339
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:50,000
the ability to disarm

1340
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:52,159
otherwise harmful and pathogenic fungi

1341
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,800
and the you know the exact mechanisms of

1342
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:56,719
this are not quite understood but this

1343
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,680
pathogen is basically neutered for lack

1344
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:02,399
of a better phrase uh and then the cell

1345
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:04,719
walls of this microbe are oxidized by

1346
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,760
the plant so it doesn't have a cell wall

1347
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,118
and it's basically just um

1348
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,200
you know it's like jason said it's

1349
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,680
within the plant and

1350
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,439
it's participating in functions like

1351
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:17,679
nutrient acquisition

1352
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,240
uh uptake you know increasing the

1353
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:22,639
efficiency of nutrient uptake uh and

1354
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:24,799
then through these cycles um you know

1355
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:27,199
the cell walls do eventually

1356
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,200
come back they're reformed

1357
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,960
and then this microbe is kicked back out

1358
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:32,719
into the soil and so you have the cycle

1359
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,838
that's occurring a lot of these

1360
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:35,118
you know maybe it's something that we

1361
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,440
could have talked about in reference to

1362
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,318
potassium but a lot of these

1363
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,559
uh

1364
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:42,318
you know particular um nuances they

1365
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,240
happen very rapidly and they're actually

1366
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,239
mediated by potassium

1367
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,118
um signal flux you know potassium fluxes

1368
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:51,039
that act as like signaling um cascades

1369
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,079
basically and so you know you see a

1370
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,079
massive

1371
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,039
uh spike in the mobility and the

1372
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,519
metabolism of potassium in conjunction

1373
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,679
with all of this turnover that we're

1374
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,079
describing here and i think part of the

1375
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:06,159
ability of plants to do all the stuff

1376
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,160
comes back to you know the fact that

1377
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,558
microbes and fungi

1378
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,199
are a lot smaller than plants plants are

1379
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,359
very complex multicellular organisms

1380
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,519
they're very very big and

1381
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,440
you know innately inherently plants have

1382
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,920
the ability to accumulate a large amount

1383
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,519
of reactive oxygen species that's just

1384
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,599
kind of the name of the game for them

1385
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,039
because they photosynthesize so

1386
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,440
when the conditions are right and

1387
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:31,440
everything is dialed in for the plants

1388
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,000
they are able to basically treat this

1389
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,639
reactive oxygen species generation

1390
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,440
capability like a weapon against

1391
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:41,440
pathogens that come in and

1392
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,358
you know in cases where the plants need

1393
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,599
defense mechanisms they can generate

1394
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,960
these reactive oxygen species like they

1395
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,200
will produce

1396
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,280
peroxides they will produce

1397
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,439
singlet oxygen free radicals and they'll

1398
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,599
basically drop nuclear bombs against the

1399
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,440
microbes because again the plants have

1400
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,680
way more stored energy potential than

1401
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,000
microbes do so this is one of those very

1402
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,679
interesting evolutionary mechanisms and

1403
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,800
tactics that they've evolved over time

1404
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:06,000
to

1405
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,519
help

1406
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,519
achieve something that until just

1407
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:10,800
recently was actually very very elusive

1408
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,280
and people

1409
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,920
either thought it was impossible or

1410
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,839
you know did not quite understand um

1411
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,358
how this process worked but you know

1412
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,039
we're starting to learn more and more

1413
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:22,880
particularly probably over the past five

1414
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,800
to ten years about some of these

1415
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,280
processes where plants can kind of turn

1416
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,960
on and off the ability of certain

1417
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,880
microbes that would otherwise be you

1418
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,480
know pathogenic and produce toxic

1419
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,480
substances to the plant

1420
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:48,880
still uh i'm still you know again

1421
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,880
geeking out on uh the amount of uh

1422
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,119
different interactions

1423
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,640
that are going on within the plant

1424
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,400
constantly

1425
00:53:54,639 --> 00:54:00,480
um and uh you know the the leaf surface

1426
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,519
the stuff above the ground

1427
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,719
is just that area where

1428
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,358
um

1429
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:12,480
it's the area we see so you would think

1430
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:14,318
that we know more about it but we don't

1431
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,559
yeah and just understanding some of the

1432
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:17,679
structures you know just like when we're

1433
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,400
talking about the roots on the

1434
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:22,318
rhizosphere it's a lot easier for us to

1435
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,920
like draw a picture of you know a

1436
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:25,759
microbe growing on a root here because

1437
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,519
you can lift the roots out and you can

1438
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,400
actually see that when we're talking

1439
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:30,960
about something like uh bacillus

1440
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,480
methylotrophicus

1441
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,559
that is growing on the outside of the

1442
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,000
stomata pores it's a lot harder for us

1443
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,760
to just be like hey look at this you

1444
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,679
know there's your that's your you know

1445
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,920
where your bacillus methylotrophic this

1446
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:43,759
is growing but uh you know the point is

1447
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,680
ultimately that the plants and the leaf

1448
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,440
surfaces they're actually very very

1449
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,639
advanced structures biological

1450
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,760
structures that are uh home in some

1451
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:54,000
cases

1452
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,760
you know not only to diverse species of

1453
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,639
microbes and fungi but also in

1454
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,559
particular cases unique and distinct

1455
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,400
species of microbes and fungi and one of

1456
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,160
them would be i think

1457
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,240
some of the species of

1458
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:07,759
bacillus methylotrophicas that exist in

1459
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,439
the leaf surface there are some that

1460
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,440
exist in

1461
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,079
the roots and so it's not like it's only

1462
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,599
found in leaf surfaces but um the ones

1463
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,680
that are found in leaf surfaces are

1464
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,280
unique because they kind of populate

1465
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:22,000
this area that's just outside of the

1466
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,720
stomata and as jason mentioned you know

1467
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,280
the only way in besides the cuticle

1468
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,118
unless the plant is damaged mechanically

1469
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,960
it is through the stomata and so as the

1470
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,079
stomata open and close

1471
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,159
to allow for water to come out and for

1472
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,599
you know oxygen to come out some

1473
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:40,480
microbes can

1474
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,240
kind of try to sneak in and so this area

1475
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,920
right outside the stomata is typically

1476
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,798
populated by

1477
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,400
microbes like this methylotrophicas and

1478
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:49,920
they have a number of cool properties

1479
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,639
one of them in particular for the

1480
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,159
methylotrophic is is that it metabolizes

1481
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:56,798
the waste stream

1482
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:59,118
of the plants so everything that's being

1483
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,000
dumped out of the stomata is basically

1484
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,680
like

1485
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,920
you know the junk or the garbage or the

1486
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:06,078
byproducts the metabolites the the

1487
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,760
plants don't find useful and it's

1488
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,440
interesting how there's certain microbes

1489
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,880
that will take that waste stream from

1490
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,798
the plant

1491
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,318
burn it as fuel and then generate

1492
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:15,920
something useful for the plants like

1493
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:17,119
this methylotrophicus that i keep

1494
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,960
mentioning is one of my favorite

1495
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,119
microbes it does produce

1496
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,559
valuable growth compounds for the plants

1497
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,680
growth hormones

1498
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,839
um

1499
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:28,239
it can feed nitrogen back to plants and

1500
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:29,920
so can help you know with nitrogen use

1501
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:32,318
efficiency for example and also with

1502
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,559
nitrogen deficiencies it can kind of

1503
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:36,079
help correct that by

1504
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,519
you know better metabolizing some

1505
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,079
nitrogen

1506
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:42,239
so there's all kinds of benefits um

1507
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,839
associated with as i mentioned earlier

1508
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,759
looking at the phylosphere in greater

1509
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:48,318
detail in understanding you know how do

1510
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,160
we set this up to be the best

1511
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,159
biological environment possible just

1512
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,118
like we currently focus on the roots and

1513
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:57,440
we notice hey if we set up the roots to

1514
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:00,240
do really well with a healthy bacterial

1515
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,159
population in a healthy fungal community

1516
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,318
then the plant itself is much more

1517
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,759
resistant to stress and disease and so

1518
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:07,920
we we should kind of take the same

1519
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,359
approach with the leaf surface to say

1520
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,280
let's create this equilibrium where

1521
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:15,759
in the phylosphere we always have

1522
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,720
healthy biological activity happening

1523
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,480
it's a little bit different than the

1524
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,239
rhizosphere obviously it's

1525
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,920
um you know you can't just spray massive

1526
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:23,358
amounts of microbes on the leaf surface

1527
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,200
it's a little bit more nuanced and a

1528
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:27,598
little bit more delicate because it's

1529
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:30,078
such an extreme harsh and unforgiving

1530
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,838
environment overall but uh yeah i do

1531
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,440
think there's a lot of like mysteries

1532
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:37,599
and magic to be unlocked there in that

1533
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,599
in that uh little known about section

1534
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:47,440
awesome awesome stuff so uh we are at

1535
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:50,559
just about at the one hour mark so go

1536
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:53,679
ahead and reset the room thank you all

1537
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:55,760
for joining this is hota herbs grow and

1538
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:58,480
tell our weekly cannabis cultivation

1539
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,599
club we are here every thursday night at

1540
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,318
9 00 pm eastern 6 p.m pacific

1541
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,440
and we are here to talk about

1542
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,239
cannabis

1543
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:11,119
uh the plant that we love and ways to

1544
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:13,439
care for it ways to

1545
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,720
enjoy it occasionally

1546
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,559
but primarily uh talking about

1547
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:20,719
how plants

1548
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,480
grow so that we have a better

1549
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,078
understanding of what's happening with

1550
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,960
the plant

1551
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,480
and that will allow us to

1552
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,240
hopefully

1553
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,119
create better

1554
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:32,239
uh

1555
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,240
healthier

1556
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,318
versions of the plant in our own

1557
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:37,838
environments whether that is commercial

1558
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:40,000
or home

1559
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:40,960
cultivation and

1560
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,039
this

1561
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,400
group hot herbs grow and tell was

1562
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,239
originally a was originally really a

1563
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,559
home cultivators

1564
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:53,199
cannabis cultivation club uh most of the

1565
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,200
folks that used to come to worcester and

1566
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:57,759
meet on a monthly basis were primarily

1567
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,480
home cultivators uh just getting

1568
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,119
together sniffing each other's jars

1569
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,920
smoking each other's weed uh and talking

1570
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,480
about how we were growing it what we

1571
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,039
were growing what breeders what you know

1572
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,519
what types of inputs environments all

1573
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,279
these different things and um

1574
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:16,559
that's where the club was born from it

1575
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,400
was born

1576
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,359
out of the need

1577
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,559
to converse with others

1578
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,078
uh

1579
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,119
having been

1580
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:29,359
uh in the closet uh hiding

1581
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:33,119
uh for so long

1582
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:35,920
it's important that as legalization

1583
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,358
continues as more people have access to

1584
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,720
legally grow the cannabis plant

1585
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:42,078
that we

1586
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:45,519
spread

1587
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,640
this knowledge openly and share this

1588
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:50,239
knowledge

1589
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:52,639
as much as possible so that others can

1590
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:55,439
also be successful

1591
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:56,879
a lot of this a lot of the time cannabis

1592
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,880
cultivation

1593
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:04,160
has been this mysterious art uh not

1594
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:08,000
necessarily because the plant itself

1595
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,598
is so incredibly difficult to grow

1596
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,838
but because the

1597
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,400
legality of it made

1598
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:15,759
it

1599
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,280
challenging

1600
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:21,359
to share

1601
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:24,960
uh fully um so we want to continue that

1602
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:27,279
sharing and i encourage you all to share

1603
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,119
uh this information not only what we're

1604
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,519
talking about tonight

1605
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:34,480
but you know with others

1606
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:36,239
help others answer questions

1607
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,639
help people

1608
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,399
learn about the plants so that they also

1609
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:41,759
can be successful in growing whatever

1610
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,680
they're growing it doesn't necessarily

1611
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,839
have to be cannabis

1612
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:48,719
a lot of the things that we talk about

1613
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:50,000
every week tend to be uh very general

1614
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:53,039
especially when we're talking about

1615
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,280
elements in the way that plants use them

1616
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,679
we we definitely talk about plants and

1617
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,599
their different groupings and their

1618
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:02,000
different families

1619
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,760
and and some of the differences between

1620
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,480
those but

1621
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,680
it's important that we do continue to

1622
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,358
help

1623
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:12,399
spread education

1624
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:14,798
which is why i appreciate being

1625
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:18,079
recorded in simulcast on the future

1626
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:20,318
cannabis project fcpo2 channel so not

1627
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,640
only should you join that subscribe to

1628
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:26,480
the future cannabis project

1629
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:27,920
and the fcp02 channel both

1630
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,159
but you should also check out all the

1631
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,519
other shows not just my show

1632
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:35,039
and nick's uh fantastic uh information

1633
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,358
every week but there's all sorts of

1634
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,440
really wonderful people on there and uh

1635
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,798
you should definitely go check out all

1636
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,920
of the shows on the future cannabis

1637
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:45,679
project peter also does a fantastic job

1638
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,440
hosting some wonderful shows i don't

1639
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:48,960
think i mentioned peter as a host all

1640
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,599
that often because i always think of him

1641
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,039
as more of a producer but he is also a

1642
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,960
fantastic host and has some great shows

1643
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,359
on the future cannabis project which is

1644
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,358
his baby so i appreciate you peter for

1645

01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:57,920
mutual friend uh somebody who i actually

1670
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:01,039
just met uh jesse

1671
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,480
uh who's doing a whole bunch of hvac

1672
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,599
stuff

1673
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:09,039
i met him at nikken this past weekend

1674
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:10,559
and so we talked about him coming on and

1675
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,000
talking about

1676
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,200
some of the differences between

1677
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,599
humidification and dehumidification and

1678
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:19,199
uh some of the reasons why you

1679
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,760
definitely you shouldn't necessarily be

1680
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:24,719
doing both um i know he said that he's

1681
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:29,039
been on your show so i'm looking forward

1682
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:30,399
to that conversation coming up soon

1683
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,000
very cool

1684
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,280
yeah

1685
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,079
and i will

1686
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,160
get a poster posted on monday as soon as

1687
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,519
i get back

1688
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:42,318
from maine

1689
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,880
yeah we actually both of us deduced that

1690
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:46,798
you were probably driving up to the to

1691
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,960
maine so we're like yeah he's probably

1692
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:52,159
driving up to me so that's why there's

1693
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,798
no show right right right no no i

1694
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:57,598
actually i'm heading up in the morning

1695
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:58,480
um because i did have to work today

1696
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,920
and

1697
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,920
needed to take care of some stuff and

1698
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,639
it's easier to

1699
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:07,039
be away from the plants for

1700
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:09,118
two and a half days than it is to be

1701
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,359
away from the plants for three and a

1702
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,358
half days

1703
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,798
uh on the watering cycle so i i can soak

1704
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,200
the plants down in the morning and then

1705
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,440
jump in the car and head up and uh

1706
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,118
fortunately because of timing i'm gonna

1707
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,760
get there probably about the time that

1708
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:28,559
uh kevin jodry touches down at the

1709
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,640
airport so i'm going to pick up kevin at

1710
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:34,480
the airport in portland

1711
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:36,879
uh on our way up to dresden maine

1712
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:40,159
for the regen conference so i'll be with

1713
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:42,240
uh dutch bloom and steve rasner our

1714
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:45,519
friend potentponics

1715
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:48,159
all weekend as well as chris trump and

1716
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:50,880
many of the other characters

1717
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:53,879
for the northeast that uh frequent the

1718
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,880
show

1719
01:04:54,239 --> 01:05:00,000
looking forward to seeing blue as well

1720
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,079
all right so let's get back to it uh

1721
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,798
nick what else would you like to talk

1722
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,720
about in the context of the phylosphere

1723
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:08,559
tonight

1724
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,318
well perhaps one interesting property to

1725
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,480
point out would be that the phylosphere

1726
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:15,358
when the biofilms are produced in the

1727
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,719
phylosphere it can also help with water

1728
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:21,279
retention and also the absorption of

1729
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:23,118
certain types of foliar sprays you know

1730
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,599
it's very common practice for instance

1731
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:27,920
to use saponins or surfactants or

1732
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:30,960
wetting agents when you're watering in

1733
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,400
the soil and similarly when

1734
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,240
certain compounds are being applied

1735
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,039
typically it's pesticides and fungicides

1736
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:37,038
but

1737
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:39,200
also with nutrients

1738
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:41,200
people also add surfactants

1739
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,879
you know saponins maybe dry from yucca

1740
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:45,919
or kelaha

1741
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,000
we're using licorice root it works great

1742
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,358
but the idea is ultimately that microbes

1743
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,559
too kind of do the same thing but

1744
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,159
they're kind of

1745
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,240
inside of the plant they're in between

1746
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,318
the cells they literally exist their

1747
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:57,679
cells are buttered up directly against

1748
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:59,199
the cell walls

1749
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,519
of the plants they exist within the

1750
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:02,480
plant and so these biofilms that they

1751
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:04,880
produce

1752
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,599
um can actually

1753
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:10,160
in a lot of ways function to increase

1754
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,599
the solubility of water in case there's

1755
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:12,960
you know rainfall

1756
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:15,119
in a natural environment or if the

1757
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,000
humidity is higher during a part of the

1758
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,760
day the biofilms themselves can trap

1759
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,599
some of that moisture and prevent

1760
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,760
desiccation later on in the day let's

1761
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,280
say the sun comes out fully and all of a

1762
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,599
sudden everything gets really dry and

1763
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,079
dehydrates on the leaf surface

1764
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,798
again the biofilms are really unique in

1765
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,480
their ability um to kind of modulate a

1766
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,038
very very otherwise unforgiving and

1767
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,639
harsh environment for these microbes

1768
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,799
that have kind of specialized in some

1769
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:43,038
cases over a very very long period of

1770
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:43,038
time

1771
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:51,679
awesome awesome stuff

1772
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,679
yeah and i i think um you see

1773
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,079
a lot of um

1774
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,200
a lot of the cases where

1775
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,599
um

1776
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:00,639
it's helpful to do that

1777
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,240
i know

1778
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:04,639
you know this is one of the reasons why

1779
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,439
spraying compost teas

1780
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,318
and

1781
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,838
applications of uh you know korean

1782
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:12,318
natural farming

1783
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,880
tend to be very foliar based especially

1784
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:16,798
in the in the vegetative cycle

1785
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,640
where we're trying to get

1786
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:22,318
as much good

1787
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:24,558
biology as well as some of the minerals

1788
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:27,358
nutrients

1789
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:31,519
onto the plant surfaces

1790
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:34,078
when we you know a lot of the the base

1791
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:35,759
vegetative cycle feeding

1792
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,280
tends to be

1793
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,000
a

1794
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,599
fpga which is a fermented plant juice

1795
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,199
and that fermented plant juice is

1796
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,838
probably going to have some of that

1797
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:48,719
surfactant quality to it especially if

1798
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,679
you use i use a fermented aloe myself

1799
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:51,439
um

1800
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:52,399
you have your

1801
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,920
uh

1802
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,119
your

1803
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,599
ohn

1804
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,280
which is an anti-pathogenic

1805
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:02,240
so you're getting some of those healthy

1806
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,240
ethnic anti-pathogenic in there you know

1807
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:05,598
putting some lab in there liquid acid

1808
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:08,239
bacteria

1809
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:11,119
but you know we also tend to use

1810
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:13,919
faa which is a fish amino acid

1811
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,599
in uh the veg feeding so getting some

1812
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,319
you know some nitrogen

1813
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,279
and getting some fish amino acids uh as

1814
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,039
well

1815
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:24,640
uh onto

1816
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:26,719
uh the leaf surface as part of that

1817
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,199
foliar spray and

1818
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:31,359
i think the other thing to remember with

1819
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,479
foliars

1820
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,759
is that

1821
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,919
depending on what you're trying to do

1822
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,719
sometimes it is helpful to go back in

1823
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,520
there

1824
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,359
and

1825
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,719
especially if you're using some heavy

1826
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,600
surfactants

1827
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:47,759
to get in there and hit them again with

1828
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,640
just some cleansing water

1829
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:52,079
uh in between to help uh mitigate some

1830
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:56,000
of that

1831
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:56,000
extra buildup over time

1832
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:02,399
yeah yeah and foliar surfaces are

1833
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,399
naturally very complex

1834
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,639
anyways you know there in a lot of ways

1835
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:08,639
they are set up to accept and receive

1836
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,600
signals that are being emitted from the

1837
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:14,000
soil and you do find in certain cases if

1838
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,920
you study soils that the microbes that

1839
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,920
are in the soils do produce volatile

1840
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,679
organic compounds that actually get

1841
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,399
airborne lifted up and then once the

1842
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,319
plants have their stomata open

1843
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:27,119
that signal works its way up to the

1844
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:30,000
canopy very very rapidly the exact

1845
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:31,519
nature and mechanics of this um

1846
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,359
you know are still kind of unclear but

1847
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,600
what is known is that you can induce

1848
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,759
some pretty powerful responses with

1849
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,159
plants this way you can actually get

1850
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:42,560
hormone-like effects generated as a

1851
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:44,238
result of these vocs being produced

1852
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,159
and emitted um

1853
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:48,399
and naturally plants produce ethylene

1854
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:50,798
which you know is gaseous so it kind of

1855
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:51,679
stands to reason that there are

1856
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:53,679
uh

1857
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:56,399
you know interactions happening up from

1858
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:59,760
the rhizosphere uh to the phylosphere

1859
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:01,599
via the air whereas in the phylosphere

1860
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,840
most of the messages that are being sent

1861
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,039
back to the roots are being loaded up in

1862
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,640
that phloem

1863
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,238
um stream so it's something that's

1864
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,840
inside of the plant it's you know been

1865
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:11,439
solubilized and it kind of gets

1866
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,960
transported down

1867
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:15,279
whereas again the opposite is true with

1868
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,760
the rhizosphere the phylosphere you can

1869
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:19,519
get stuff that is released from the soil

1870
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,239
and works its way up so that that part's

1871
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,239
interesting too

1872
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:26,639
i was reading a uh

1873
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:29,198
an article earlier today and i was

1874
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,880
trying to find it but um you know as you

1875
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:34,479
were mentioning the volatile

1876
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:36,319
releasing volatile compounds um a lot of

1877
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:37,359
um

1878
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:39,519
what they're

1879
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:42,000
starting to understand more about and

1880
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,840
i've heard uh paul van hortmann talk

1881
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,840
about

1882
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,199
terpenes being released from hemp plants

1883
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,480
in the same way

1884
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:53,039
is that these volatile compounds

1885
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:55,039
in many cases actually affect the

1886
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:58,319
environment

1887
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:59,840
and as they are released into the air

1888
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:03,840
they will

1889
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:05,600
in many cases reflect light and so the

1890
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,159
benefits from

1891
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,840
trees and forests

1892
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,599
and things like that is not just about

1893
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:15,600
the carbon sink that they are

1894
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,920
but it's also their

1895
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,560
ability to release these volatile

1896
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:23,840
compounds and terpenes

1897
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:27,280
into the air which helps actually keep

1898
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:29,760
the planet cooler um so

1899
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:31,279
in many cases these volatile compounds

1900
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,239
are are helping

1901
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:36,399
with some of that cooling action

1902
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:38,079
um and i've definitely heard

1903
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:40,479
paul van horman talk about that a bunch

1904
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:43,519
of times when he talks about

1905
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:45,839
how hemp can help save the planet

1906
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,480
in that the release of the terpenes and

1907
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:51,760
these volatile compounds

1908
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:53,919
up into the air are

1909
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,960
very very important for helping with the

1910
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,279
overall

1911
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,520
health of the environment and keeping

1912
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,599
temperatures cooler and helping with the

1913
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,920
build up and creation of clouds and

1914
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,280
moisture

1915
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,440
yeah yeah that's something we had talked

1916
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,439
about a few episodes back maybe in one

1917
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:11,519
of the earlier episodes about how

1918
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:13,279
terpenes are basically the ideas

1919
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,520
terpenes are these you know classes of

1920
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:17,279
compounds that mediate relationships

1921
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,880
across entire kingdoms and in certain

1922
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,599
cases like if you're walking through the

1923
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,600
forest as the sun is rising

1924
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,960
well the trees are aware of this and

1925
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:28,159
they're going to start producing alpha

1926
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,520
pinene and so this distinct odor of pine

1927
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:30,719
you can actually see if you're standing

1928
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,320
at the right angle when the sun is

1929
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,119
coming up

1930
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:34,639
uh

1931
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:37,279
directly over the forest it's a little

1932
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,039
bit more blue and this kind of like blue

1933
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:41,279
haze is actually the

1934
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:43,279
volatile turbines being emitted because

1935
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,519
as jason mentioned

1936
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,679
as the rays of the light you know as the

1937
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,440
rays of the sunlight come in

1938
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,119
part of that energy

1939
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:52,719
is absorbed by the terpenes that are

1940
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:54,640
being emitted by the

1941
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,399
pine trees it's it's actually a literal

1942
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,960
sunscreen that's being ejected out into

1943
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:01,119
the atmosphere and so it does have this

1944
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,439
effect of absorbing some of that excess

1945
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,439
energy and creating a cooler

1946
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,279
environment overall one that

1947
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:08,479
you know soaks up some of that radiative

1948
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:10,479
stress

1949
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:12,639
that's outside of the frequency ranges

1950
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:14,399
that the plants might want to keep

1951
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,679
active for like chlorophyll for instance

1952
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:17,119
you know maybe they need to get other

1953
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:18,640
frequencies

1954
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:20,559
out of the way first and then

1955
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,000
chlorophyll is going to be more or less

1956
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,400
you know it's going to have this paved

1957
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,079
road to allow all the light energy to

1958
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:28,000
come in and to hit on chlorophyll

1959
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:30,000
without causing too much stress and too

1960
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
much damage so yeah it's very

1961
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
interesting

1962
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:38,559
very very cool stuff and

1963
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:40,639
um

1964
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,800
most of those

1965
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:46,239
items are are coming from the

1966
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:48,480
phylosphere not from the rise of fear so

1967
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:51,919
um the phylosphere again

1968
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:54,079
uh having a tremendous impact on uh the

1969
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,079
health of the plant but also the health

1970
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:58,960
of our planet

1971
01:13:56,079 --> 01:14:01,439
so really interesting um

1972
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,920
that uh

1973
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,678
these uh how how important the

1974
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,158
phylosphere is

1975
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:11,760
uh and those interactions are for the

1976
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:14,479
for all of these uh different uh

1977
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,320
aspects uh again not something we

1978
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:18,718
normally talk about or i personally

1979
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:20,639
focus on all that much

1980
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,399
i tend to again talk about what's going

1981
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,239
on in the soil and how we prevent

1982
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:26,559
flooding

1983
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:29,599
and how we improve soil health and cut

1984
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:31,840
down on our use and needs for uh for uh

1985
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,120
for chemicals and things like that so

1986
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:38,560
it's uh it's super interesting um

1987
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:41,679
let's go ahead and move on

1988
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:44,320
um and i did uh

1989
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:46,800
for damore i will get you quickly a link

1990
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:50,559
for the regen conference into the chat

1991
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,480
shortly um but i i wanted to get um i

1992
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,440
was looking to see if i could find that

1993
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:56,559
uh

1994
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:59,119
that article that um and i did so i'm

1995
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,520
going to go ahead and get that pinned up

1996
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:04,158
into

1997
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,760
into the chat here

1998
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:07,759
so it's cool

1999
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,679
it's good stuff and it's cool because

2000
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:13,920
the global temperatures would actually

2001
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,920
be warmer if it wasn't for them

2002
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:17,359
it's fitting that i was reading that

2003
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,760
today when we were going to talk about

2004
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:21,599
the phylosphere so

2005
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,320
very very good

2006
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,400
so rhizosphere obviously we've mentioned

2007
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:28,319
it a couple times tonight and

2008
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:30,639
you know we can't talk about the

2009
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:34,079
phylosphere without also mentioning the

2010
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:37,520
rhizosphere uh which is where we do

2011
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:38,960
spend a lot of time chatting um i know i

2012
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,280
do and

2013
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,840
the rhizosphere is what's happening on

2014
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:45,679
the soil and down

2015
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,600
and primarily when we talk about the

2016
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:49,760
rhizosphere what we're talking about is

2017
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,360
the area that's between 1 and 10

2018
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,560
millimeters

2019
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:58,000
away from the root surface

2020
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:59,760
so the rhizosphere isn't everything

2021
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,840
underground

2022
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:06,400
the rhizosphere is this zone

2023
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,119
of interaction and activity

2024
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:12,079
that's happening directly around the

2025
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:12,079
roots themselves

2026
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:22,000
the rhizosphere is

2027
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:24,719
where the soil food web interactions

2028
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,479
tend to happen the most

2029
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,319
um although

2030
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:32,000
al as we mentioned earlier during the

2031
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:33,359
conversation there is plenty of

2032
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,479
insects

2033
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:39,198
uh as well as bacteria and fungi that do

2034
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,198
travel uh between

2035
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:45,039
those different zones you will find

2036
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:47,919
similar bacteria and fungal life in

2037
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,840
both the phylosphere and the rhizosphere

2038
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:53,600
um different

2039
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:56,880
bacterial and fungal life uh exists in

2040
01:16:53,600 --> 01:17:00,480
the back obviously in the rhizosphere

2041
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:02,480
that cannot exist in the phylosphere

2042
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:07,198
as nick mentioned earlier because it is

2043
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:08,718
a darker moister place with a lot more

2044
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:10,879
biofilm

2045
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,560
than exists above

2046
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,520
we talked a little bit about the

2047
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,679
rhizophagic cycle

2048
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,440
when we were talking about

2049
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,480
the different types of interactions

2050
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:23,519
between

2051
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:25,519
bacteria becoming part of the plant

2052
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,280
and that also is a really really

2053
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,760
interesting

2054
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:32,479
interaction to me that that was one of

2055
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:35,039
the things i think that kind of captured

2056
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:37,839
my fascination more

2057
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:40,560
with learning about how

2058
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,360
plants were actually

2059
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,640
taking up nutrients right it's not just

2060
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,599
about

2061
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:50,239
them sucking up things in the water that

2062
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,239
they pull into themselves so

2063
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:53,119
really really um

2064
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:54,158
it's

2065
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:56,319
very

2066
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:58,799
interesting that those interactions are

2067
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:00,719
just starting to be discovered

2068
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,360
but all those crazy interactions that

2069
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,560
are happening in the soil

2070
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,279
are

2071
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,960
the primary place that the plant does

2072
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:10,960
get most of its

2073
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,480
nutrients and food

2074
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,158
other than

2075
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:20,399
the largest macronutrients

2076
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:24,559
of uh oxygen and hydrogen which it's uh

2077
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:27,679
getting in the form of carbon dioxide

2078
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:30,400
as well as water um when it absorbs uh

2079
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:32,399
moisture and vapor

2080
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:34,879
where's the carbon at man you forgot the

2081
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:38,000
carbon i forgot the carbon man the

2082
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:40,480
carbon is part of that in the co2

2083
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:44,319
uh is part of that interaction and the

2084
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:46,559
water uh and the carbon is is is you're

2085
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,679
getting the carbon out when you break

2086
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,239
down

2087
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:53,719
that hydrogen and oxygen did i get that

2088
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:53,718
correct at least

2089
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:59,760
well

2090
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:02,000
yeah the the gist the premise yes yes

2091
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:05,199
it's all about carbon you know

2092
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,600
it's always about carbon it's always

2093
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:08,639
carbon's the yeah carbons the uh the

2094
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,480
number one

2095
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,079
most important and in fact even water

2096
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,000
metabolism revolves around to the

2097
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:16,319
acquisition of carbon plants have

2098
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,560
invented this process basically to

2099
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,158
suck carbon out of the air and then over

2100
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,920
the course of 100 million years they do

2101
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:23,839
this thing called create soil and then

2102
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,199
they give rise to

2103
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,400
hundreds of thousands of different

2104
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:28,960
potentially millions of different

2105
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:31,198
species of microbes and fungi that are

2106
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:33,279
found nowhere else except for within

2107
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:35,599
soils so it's very very interesting to

2108
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:37,519
see this process of carbon being

2109
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,199
recycled over and over and over again

2110
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,120
and it kind of makes sense that when

2111
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:42,238
plants produce sugars and carbohydrates

2112
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:44,079
throughout the day that they want to

2113
01:19:42,238 --> 01:19:45,599
funnel those down into the roots and

2114
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,359
kind of like

2115
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,000
store that carbon you know because if it

2116
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:51,519
gets released back into the atmosphere

2117
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,520
all of their hard work was basically

2118
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,520
lost kind of a bummer if you're working

2119
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,400
all day and and all that goes to waste

2120
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,480
so

2121
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,599
these microbes and fungi do a really

2122
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:03,439
good job at participating in cycles

2123
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,039
some cycles take longer than others some

2124
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:07,519
are very very long like you know

2125
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:09,359
decomposition cycles that create humic

2126
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,920
substances in the soil those

2127
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:13,039
cycles those processes take very very

2128
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,279
long periods of time you know

2129
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:17,519
potentially tens if not hundreds of

2130
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:20,479
uh millions of years to you know get to

2131
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,320
the spot where they're finally

2132
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:25,519
at their terminal sort of metabolite

2133
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:27,079
point um so there's you know this vested

2134
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,159
interest that all of these

2135
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:31,679
microorganisms and also plants

2136
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:34,559
collectively have

2137
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,960
to take carbon out of the air and bury

2138
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,719
it in the ground uh as much as they

2139
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,719
possibly can

2140
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,800
um and all of them kind of help each

2141
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,279
other out with this process overall if

2142
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,400
the plants need some kind of mineral

2143
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:48,158
nutrient

2144
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,000
then the microbes and fungi are highly

2145
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:51,279
specialized to be able to go and do that

2146
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,520
for the plant

2147
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:55,439
and uh on the flip side there is a

2148
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,520
little bit of a cookie or a snack or a

2149
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:58,839
cake as jason likes to say

2150
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,800
in exchange

2151
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:05,840
for cookies and cakes cookies and cakes

2152
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:08,560
those sugars and starches the exodites

2153
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:11,920
the cookies and cakes is dr elaine

2154
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:13,920
um i i definitely gotta i gotta uh give

2155
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,560
her credit for that but it is it's it's

2156
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:18,239
cookies and cakes you're attracting the

2157
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,960
plant is releasing the exodites the

2158
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:23,678
sugars and starches that it uh

2159
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,600
knows are going to bring in the bacteria

2160
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,960
and fungi that are going to be important

2161
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,239
to helping it

2162
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:32,960
get at those nutrients and and elemental

2163
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:35,678
minerals that it needs to survive

2164
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,880
um which is also really fascinating i i

2165
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:40,239
wonder

2166
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:42,639
um if there is a

2167
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:45,119
as we mentioned before you know the the

2168
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:47,760
there's definitely some

2169
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,439
compounds that the plant releases to

2170
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,480
fight off

2171
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:54,000
um you know predators or pests and

2172
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:55,678
things like that i wonder if there's

2173
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,840
those similar

2174
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,800
cookies and cakes being released in the

2175
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,520
phylosphere to attract the appropriate

2176
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,639
uh bacteria and fungi that we're not

2177
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:09,280
we're just not aware of

2178
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:11,520
yeah yeah there's probably a very very

2179
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:13,119
complex relationship too and then in

2180
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,120
some cases there's

2181
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:16,880
probably a concentration gradient like

2182
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:19,439
the methylotrophicus

2183
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,679
bacteria that are they they like to hang

2184
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:23,919
out around the stomata because they take

2185
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,359
the waste stream that comes out of the

2186
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,119
stomata pores

2187
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:29,039
and they treat that like a food source

2188
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:30,639
and they pass stuff back to plants and

2189
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,479
so i imagine there's

2190
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:34,319
that that beneficial street is two-way

2191
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:37,279
because the stomata themselves represent

2192
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:38,880
one of the major entrance points for

2193
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:40,319
pathogens to be able to get into the

2194
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,159
plants and so

2195
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:44,079
um you know whoever the guards are are

2196
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:46,079
probably being paid pretty well to make

2197
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:47,840
sure that the environment is kept clean

2198
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:51,479
and all the bad guys get to

2199
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,480
you know stay out

2200
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:56,479
probably being fed carbon

2201
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,479
that's right

2202
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:06,158
um

2203
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:08,960
so um as i mentioned as we as we talked

2204
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:09,719
about earlier i think you know similarly

2205
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,039
uh

2206
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:15,840
biofilm is uh super important in the

2207
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:18,000
rhizosphere as well uh it

2208
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,400
you know as i mentioned when you pull

2209
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,920
the plant up and and you see those roots

2210
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:24,000
underneath and you see those little

2211
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,039
clumps of soil and things sticking to

2212
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,560
the roots

2213
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:30,560
that is the biofilm and that is those

2214
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,039
little interactive environments as i

2215
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,880
mentioned that rhizosphere uh it's

2216
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:36,158
almost like a mobile rhizosphere at that

2217
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,279
point because you kind of took it with

2218
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:40,399
you but

2219
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:41,599
that um those clumps those aggregates in

2220
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:46,638
the soil

2221
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:49,039
is all part of um they they stick around

2222
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:51,359
um after the

2223
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:52,960
after they're no longer part of that

2224
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,559
rhizosphere

2225
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:59,119
um hopefully

2226
01:23:54,560 --> 01:24:02,400
the roots um you know have gone down

2227
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:04,719
deep and the deeper those roots go

2228
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:07,599
as they go on their

2229
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:10,399
path down into the soil

2230
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,079
they create more and more of these

2231
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:13,359
aggregates they make these little

2232
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:14,639
pockets

2233
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:17,439
of

2234
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:18,719
biofilm and bacteria

2235
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:20,399
and root

2236
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:23,840
and all of those other things as they

2237
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:25,599
make their way down and that allows the

2238
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,719
channeling of

2239
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,840
water

2240
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,560
nutrients and

2241
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,760
bacteria

2242
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:37,760
and fungi which are brought along with

2243
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:41,520
the water deeper and deeper into

2244
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:46,320
the soil as that process happens

2245
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:48,960
they continue to start breaking down

2246
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:52,079
the elements minerals nutrients and

2247
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:55,600
things that are locked in those lower

2248
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:58,719
layers of soil that plants may not

2249
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:01,360
necessarily have had access to

2250
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,600
so in many cases

2251
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:06,079
some of the limitations that

2252
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,639
plants will run into

2253
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:11,279
is because they will there will be some

2254
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:14,079
limitations to their ability to continue

2255
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:17,439
to go down further

2256
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:19,279
directly down into the soil into

2257
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:21,198
expanding those

2258
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:22,639
channels for water and nutrients and

2259
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:26,158
expanding their

2260
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:27,279
rhizosphere as they do that um and so

2261
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:29,599
those

2262
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:30,479
um in

2263
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,360
in

2264
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:35,919
malawi for instance there's a

2265
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:38,079
technique called deep bed farming that's

2266
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:41,920
being used and taught by

2267
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:45,439
an organization uh called the tiene org

2268
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:48,079
and um they've trained it's uh it's over

2269
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:51,439
ten thousand farmers

2270
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:53,119
in this um technique of regenerative

2271
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:55,839
natural farming

2272
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:55,840
where they

2273
01:25:56,238 --> 01:26:00,638
they have

2274
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:02,479
suffered because of the environment and

2275
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:04,319
because of the

2276
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:07,039
western

2277
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:11,198
farming practices that were

2278
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:14,158
forced upon them in many cases

2279
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:16,638
they basically have developed this super

2280
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:19,519
hard pan

2281
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:22,960
this surface of soil

2282
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:26,000
that is extremely compacted about a foot

2283
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:28,960
and a half down into the soil

2284
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,880
and sometimes down as deep as

2285
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:34,960
15 feet into the soil and so

2286
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,520
they are able to

2287
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:40,319
you know break up the top layer of soil

2288
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:42,239
and get crops in but what happens is

2289
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:45,039
that the crops aren't able to put their

2290
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:47,198
roots down into the land

2291
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:49,600
deep enough for them to be able to

2292
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:51,678
create channels for water

2293
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,520
as well as to be able to get at the

2294
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:56,158
nutrients and minerals and things that

2295
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:58,800
are actually lowered down in the soil

2296
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:00,638
not in this depleted area that's above

2297
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:03,199
the hard pan

2298
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:06,079
and so they are

2299
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:10,238
they basically have to get in there

2300
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:13,439
uh and break up that hard pan

2301
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:17,279
which will allow their future plantings

2302
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:18,719
to be able to grow into that soil and by

2303
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:20,158
doing that

2304
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:23,920
they've

2305
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:25,679
been able to farm without the need for

2306
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:29,039
nutrients

2307
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:31,679
or any industrial fertilizers

2308
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:33,920
and it has allowed them to

2309
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:35,440
completely

2310
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,800
grow

2311
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:38,719
amazing

2312
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,119
forests of food

2313
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:43,840
in some of these

2314
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:45,359
really really tough areas where

2315
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,520
they get

2316
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:49,519
you know like three inches of rain in a

2317
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,280
couple of hours

2318
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:54,560
and then they'll go for periods of time

2319
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:56,399
with almost no water and so uh

2320
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,080
traditionally

2321
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:00,799
because the

2322
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:03,679
the hard pan underneath and because the

2323
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,440
way they laid their rows

2324
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:08,079
there was lots of flooding which would

2325
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:09,039
destroy their fields and their crops or

2326
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:12,158
cause

2327
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:16,079
famine in many cases um

2328
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:17,119
so that rises fear and being able to

2329
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:17,920
create

2330
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:20,639
a

2331
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,480
ability for the roots to continue to

2332
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:25,520
travel down

2333
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:26,638
deeply into the soil to develop a bigger

2334
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,040
and bigger

2335
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:31,520
rhizosphere a bigger biome

2336
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:35,519
create more of those aggregates and then

2337
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:39,199
eventually leave all of that carbon

2338
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:42,639
uh behind as well as those natural

2339
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:45,439
aggregates and channels for water which

2340
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:48,000
helps more moisture and water go down

2341
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:49,439
into the soil as opposed to

2342
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,238
runoff

2343
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:55,279
running off your property and not uh

2344
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:56,559
actually allowing your

2345
01:28:55,279 --> 01:29:00,238
your soil

2346
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,239
to get properly saturated

2347
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,520
yeah yeah and that's part of the dance

2348
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:07,119
between microbes and uh fungi and

2349
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,800
plants is that when the plants produce

2350
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:11,679
certain compounds and release them from

2351
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,199
the roots it's kind of it you know in

2352
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:16,960
the best interest of the microbes and

2353
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:18,559
fungi to find a way to pass that carbon

2354
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,960
as an energy source around back and

2355
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,760
forth and in other cases

2356
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,840
uh

2357
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,440
to create humic substances which

2358
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,880
contribute to things like the fertility

2359
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:28,719
of soils and

2360
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,600
you know the longevity of

2361
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,520
um

2362
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,360
populations you know it doesn't matter

2363
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,360
if it's plants or microbes or fungi any

2364
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:36,719
time that you're building organic matter

2365
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:39,039
into the soil you're going to increase

2366
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:40,399
the likelihood of those populations

2367
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:41,840
surviving

2368
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:44,000
whatever kind of changes are going to be

2369
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,840
present in that environment so

2370
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,158
in a lot of ways as this bulk draw of

2371
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:50,960
carbon is going from the air into the

2372
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:52,719
soil the microbiome in the fungi are

2373
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,119
acting on these

2374
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,800
carbon substrates to help create in an

2375
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:58,639
environment

2376
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,440
that you know starts to take up a larger

2377
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,960
larger surface area and oftentimes

2378
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:05,039
initially this environment that i'm

2379
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,560
talking about is actually just outside

2380
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:08,079
the rhizosphere because if you think

2381
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,039
about it when the roots themselves are

2382
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:12,559
growing

2383
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:13,840
the roots are um ultimately just sensing

2384
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,679
their environment around them and

2385
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,199
they're signals that are being fed back

2386
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:18,800
to the roots as they're growing in real

2387
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:21,279
time because if there's a signal that

2388
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,560
comes back and says you know dead end

2389
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:24,000
coming up here

2390
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,679
uh there's a rock immediately ahead

2391
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,560
there's no way the roots gonna grow

2392
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:27,359
through that

2393
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,520
you know

2394
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:31,039
there's there's this feedback mechanism

2395
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,800
and part of it is these microbes are

2396
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:35,279
involved

2397
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,079
in sending these signals back and so as

2398
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:40,158
the roots are growing and the root hairs

2399
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:41,600
there's like this little cap that's on

2400
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:43,920
the outside and it keeps pushing through

2401
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,560
the soil this cap on the outside of this

2402
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,480
cap is a whole bunch of active microbes

2403
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:50,480
and active fungi that are conditioning

2404
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:51,599
the soil just ahead of where the roots

2405
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,279
growing because they're trying their

2406
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,039
best to make it

2407
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:57,119
ascertainable for the roots they want

2408
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:59,439
that the perfect environments that the

2409
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:01,920
plant can grow there and it can uptake

2410
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:04,559
the minerals and the water and so on and

2411
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,158
so forth because if the plant is

2412
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,400
able to do all of those things then it

2413
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:10,479
can photosynthesize better which means

2414
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:11,920
that it can produce more sugars and

2415
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:13,839
feed the microbes and the fungi and

2416
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,679
continue this whole process this very

2417
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,600
dynamic process of

2418
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,840
you know it's like in in a short time

2419
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,360
span you have microbes and fungi

2420
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:24,159
actively conditioning

2421
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:25,599
soils to help roots grow in the process

2422
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:27,279
of them actually growing and in some

2423
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:30,560
cases when we're talking about

2424
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:32,238
you know several inches to several feet

2425
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,000
at a clip you know that's a lot of

2426
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:34,799
movement that these microbes and fungi

2427
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,960
make

2428
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:39,119
but also it's true to say that

2429
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:42,158
humic substances which take millions of

2430
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:43,840
years to properly form are also being

2431
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:46,000
sort of conditioned and brought into

2432
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:48,719
existence by microbes and fungi the same

2433
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,600
ones that also on shorter time

2434
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:53,359
spans and scales of time will um you

2435
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,440
know help microbes and

2436
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:56,880
or i'm sorry we'll help plants grow

2437
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:58,399
and access the minerals that they need

2438
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,760
so this is a very very dynamic dance

2439
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:01,759
that's happening back and forth

2440
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,920
excuse me

2441
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:09,760
um

2442
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:12,719
yeah it's um

2443
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:15,119
very very uh

2444
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:15,119
deep

2445
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:19,359
not to

2446
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:23,198
use a pun um so

2447
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:24,719
anyway uh it is 10 30.

2448
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:29,678
uh we are

2449
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:32,319
coming uh up on uh the final half hour

2450
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:33,119
of the show this is hot herbs grow and

2451
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:35,759
tell

2452
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:38,479
we are here in our weekly cannabis

2453
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:40,960
cultivation club coming to you every

2454
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:44,158
thursday night at 9 00 pm

2455
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:45,679
uh 9 p.m eastern 6 p.m pacific don't

2456
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:47,679
want to get those backwards because then

2457
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,639
i'll be up in midnight trying to do the

2458
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:51,440
show

2459
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:54,000
and uh it's hard enough as it is

2460
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:57,039
uh some of these some days to do the

2461
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,600
show at uh from 9 to 11.

2462
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:02,319
but we are here every week on clubhouse

2463
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,920
so if you enjoyed what you heard tonight

2464
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:05,920
and you're not already a member please

2465
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:08,800
click on the little green house and join

2466
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:11,679
the future cannabis club project club as

2467
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:14,560
well as give a follow to nick myself

2468
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:17,199
peter as and anybody in the studio

2469
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,159
audience tonight uh because they are

2470
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:20,960
also

2471
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:22,799
obviously some plant geeks if they could

2472
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,560
see here and listen to us talk about the

2473
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:26,400
rhizosphere in the phylosphere for

2474
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,880
almost two hours

2475
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:31,839
so i appreciate every one of you for

2476
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:35,600
fellow plant geeks for joining us

2477
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:36,880
as you most of you do every week

2478
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,679
we are

2479
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:42,880
recorded and simulcast on the future

2480
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:44,880
cannabis project on youtube uh this week

2481
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,639
it will be as i mentioned a recording

2482
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:49,039
they're not going to get the live feed

2483
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:51,520
we don't have the live interaction

2484
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:53,840
distracting me on youtube this week as

2485
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,760
well which is kind of nice

2486
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,480
that i'm actually able to just focus

2487
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:00,239
directly on the conversation with nick

2488
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:02,158
and the topic

2489
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:04,718
and not necessarily worrying about

2490
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:07,679
moderating some of the uh chaos that

2491
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:09,760
tends to go on on the youtube feed

2492
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:12,319
uh in the background you never know

2493
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:15,600
where that conversation is gonna go

2494
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:18,639
uh off-screen off to the side uh away

2495
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:22,719
from our main topic of the night

2496
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:25,840
um so the you know i think we've uh

2497
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:29,520
covered a lot of different aspects about

2498
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:31,440
both of those different zones uh and the

2499
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,920
importance of

2500
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:35,599
thinking about the

2501
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:37,199
bacterial

2502
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,320
fungal

2503
01:34:37,198 --> 01:34:43,519
needs of those different zones

2504
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:44,960
the different interactions that

2505
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:48,480
are just

2506
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:51,439
being uncovered in many cases in many in

2507
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:53,759
many ways

2508
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:56,399
you know again with the rhizosphere i

2509
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,880
think you know tilling is another

2510
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:00,960
uh thing that most

2511
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:03,840
unfortunately most commercial growers

2512
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,600
are not aware of how damaging

2513
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,159
tilling is

2514
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,320
to the rhizosphere

2515
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:12,879
being able to support those healthy

2516
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:14,559
biomes is super important and you know i

2517
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,520
think tilling

2518
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,440
when

2519
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:20,080
people started tilling

2520
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:23,678
um and in many in some cases if you're

2521
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:26,000
doing low tilling um or really just

2522
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:27,118
doing tilling to kind of break up the

2523
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,880
soil

2524
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:30,319
with a

2525
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:34,239
more

2526
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:35,920
modest or manual um you know more of a

2527
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:38,799
manual plow

2528
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:40,800
or a thing like that then it's probably

2529
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,320
not as bad

2530
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,279
you know it's it's just part of the

2531
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:48,319
process of of in some cases

2532
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:50,399
uh creating a proper environment for

2533
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:51,759
your plants to be successful to get them

2534
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:55,039
going

2535
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:57,199
but when we use these mechanized tilling

2536
01:35:55,039 --> 01:36:01,118
methods that have these

2537
01:35:57,198 --> 01:36:04,079
mechanical metallic spinning discs

2538
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:06,479
that cut deeply deeply into the soil and

2539
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:09,840
spin and destroy everything they come

2540
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:12,879
across what happens is it destroys that

2541
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:15,760
biology it destroys that

2542
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:18,279
rhizosphere that biome

2543
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:21,679
kills the fungal bodies it kills the

2544
01:36:18,279 --> 01:36:24,319
arthropods and all of the fantastic

2545
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:27,199
things that are living in that soil

2546
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:30,559
along with a lot of that biology it

2547
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:33,039
destroys those aggregates and breaks up

2548
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,880
all of that fantastic biofilm that's

2549
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:37,198
been created

2550
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:39,920
and is really really a has a

2551
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:41,599
tremendously negative impact

2552
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,039
on um

2553
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,320
on the soil

2554
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:47,439
fertility

2555
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:51,279
and the rhizosphere probably one of the

2556
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:53,759
most damaging things that we actually do

2557
01:36:51,279 --> 01:36:56,238
as part of our normal

2558
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,719
farming practices

2559
01:36:56,238 --> 01:37:01,198
again i think the initial idea around it

2560
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:02,960
probably wasn't as bad

2561
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:04,638
again just breaking up some of the soil

2562
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,600
so that you can get planting in there

2563
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:07,279
but

2564
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,039
really tilling is just such a

2565
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:10,559
destructive thing because it does

2566
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:14,840
destroy

2567
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:16,719
that rhizosphere as well as really just

2568
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:20,800
expose

2569
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:23,600
tremendous amounts of carbon to oxygen

2570
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:26,480
which creates co2 and then you're just

2571
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,920
sucking all of that wonderful beautiful

2572
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:29,839
carbon

2573
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:35,239
out of the soil

2574
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:35,239
and letting it just go up into the air

2575
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:38,158
yeah and interestingly enough it's

2576
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,000
actually uh

2577
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:42,399
being understood more and more nowadays

2578
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,920
that the practice of heavy tilling which

2579
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,599
most people would just you know consider

2580
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,880
to be regular telling but this like

2581
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,800
really really

2582
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,400
heavy treatment of the soil does

2583
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,480
actually release

2584
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:55,039
stored carbon

2585
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:57,519
back into the air and it does actually

2586
01:37:55,039 --> 01:38:00,319
create this transfer back i mean plants

2587
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:02,320
spend a very very long time

2588
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:04,238
and they put a lot of energy into

2589
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:06,079
sucking carbon out of

2590
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:08,000
the air so it's a little bit ironic how

2591
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:09,279
between cycles of plants we decide to

2592
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,079
come back through and say okay we're

2593
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:12,559
gonna

2594
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:13,679
reset all the work that was done um

2595
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:15,039
and

2596
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,960
you know in some cases like the

2597
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:18,880
relationships

2598
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,560
between plant fungi and microbes these

2599
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:23,359
things are still being

2600
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:25,520
uh studied you know to understand them

2601
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:27,279
as they occur in these small segments of

2602
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,480
these slices that were capable of

2603
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:30,719
measuring like in a controlled

2604
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:32,559
experiment for example this doesn't

2605
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,639
really speak to

2606
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:37,520
what happens when you don't touch

2607
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:39,359
you know land for maybe 10 20 30 years

2608
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,280
and that kind of research is of course

2609
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:43,198
being done but it's very very

2610
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:45,519
um you know few and far between you're

2611
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:47,439
not likely to find something

2612
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,960
as extensive and deep and historical as

2613
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:50,479
that and when you do

2614
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,239
uh you should you know definitely hold

2615
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:54,158
on to it because it's

2616
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:56,319
an example of something that

2617
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:58,399
you know was in the making for 30 plus

2618
01:38:56,319 --> 01:39:00,559
years let's say um and and you really

2619
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:03,118
get a chance to look at what

2620
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,800
uh what happens when you don't disturb

2621
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:07,359
something but you just nourish and allow

2622
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,679
it to kind of grow and develop its own

2623
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:12,238
complexity in its own maturity i mean

2624
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:13,920
get to a spot where you get this broad

2625
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:15,678
expression of microbes and a broad

2626
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:17,600
expression of fungi and

2627
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:19,840
uh you know in a lot of cases you know

2628
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,440
the the uh

2629
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,600
the depth and complexity of these

2630
01:39:21,439 --> 01:39:25,118
microbial populations is something that

2631
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:28,239
should not be

2632
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:30,479
underrated as far as the ability of some

2633
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:33,039
of these microbes to produce beneficial

2634
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:34,399
substances for humans too um you know

2635
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:38,639
there's a very very

2636
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:41,279
uh sort of famous and popular

2637
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:42,960
compound um produced by fungi is a

2638
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:45,359
specific species of fungus that was

2639
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:47,520
found in only a single soil sample in

2640
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:50,479
the world and has not been found ever

2641
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:52,880
since and it has been you know a very

2642
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:54,399
very helpful medicine it's been

2643
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,800
something that has allowed for the

2644
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:59,599
global eradication of certain parasitic

2645
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,679
diseases in third world countries and

2646
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:03,600
there's been over 40 billion doses of

2647
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:06,399
this particular compound

2648
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,600
administered globally so far so

2649
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:09,118
uh

2650
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,800
yeah it's very interesting you know we

2651
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:12,799
got to do a good job of taking care of

2652
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,639
the soil and the phylosphere and paying

2653
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,960
attention to some of the very very

2654
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:18,560
diverse species of microbes and fungi

2655
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:20,639
that can grow and and really just

2656
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,080
screening them and monitoring them for

2657
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:24,159
metabolites that they might be able to

2658
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:26,880
produce that are functional medicines

2659
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:28,960
for humans or you know

2660
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:31,279
biostimulants in agriculture for that

2661
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,279
matter

2662
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,679
michael welcome to the stage thank you

2663
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:41,760
for joining us

2664
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:45,279
i see you are a rej a sustainable

2665
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,960
cannabis food and alpaca farmer how you

2666
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:49,118
doing tonight

2667
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,198
i'm doing good i'm trying to be

2668
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:54,000
sustainable i should put up there uh

2669
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:56,079
trying to close aren't we all right yeah

2670
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,960
trying to close as many loops as i can

2671
01:40:56,079 --> 01:41:00,319
but so i'm a cannabis farmer as well and

2672
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,359
i'm in uh

2673
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:04,479
raised

2674
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:05,920
beds living soil and just

2675
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:07,759
going back to

2676
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:09,440
what you were i believe you were saying

2677
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:12,480
about the

2678
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:14,799
damage of tilling you know i don't go

2679
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:16,559
with a tiller but

2680
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,639
are are you suggesting that if you could

2681
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:20,159
just leave it all alone except for

2682
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:22,400
digging the hole where you're going to

2683
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:24,638
plant the plant that that is what would

2684
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:26,079
be the best thing you could do

2685
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:28,800
absolutely

2686
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:28,800
100

2687
01:41:29,279 --> 01:41:34,319
those roots and existing structures

2688
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:36,880
are

2689
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:40,479
fantastic sources of

2690
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:41,359
nutrients uh and minerals that have been

2691
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:43,839
you know

2692
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:46,238
sucked up into the plant and

2693
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:49,119
though all those as i was mentioning

2694
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:51,919
earlier all those fantastic uh channels

2695
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:53,759
and aggregates have been created so

2696
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:56,960
in many cases

2697
01:41:53,760 --> 01:42:01,199
uh using uh cover crop

2698
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:03,520
as well to help protect the soil

2699
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:07,039
structure in the wintertime and and the

2700
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,679
off months in between your crops is also

2701
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:11,920
super beneficial to to

2702
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:14,480
and then basically just going in and

2703
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:16,800
chopping and dropping that stuff and

2704
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:19,279
if you happen to you know running your

2705
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:21,679
alpaca over those fields after you've

2706
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:24,000
done like a chop and drop on those cover

2707
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:25,520
crops or just letting them go through

2708
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,198
there and eat that

2709
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,119
they're going to create you know they're

2710
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:32,079
going to crush down some of that plant

2711
01:42:29,118 --> 01:42:33,759
material and and get and help enrich

2712
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:36,880
your soil further

2713
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:39,440
so yeah no absolutely i would highly

2714
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,840
recommend just trapping the

2715
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:44,799
chopping the stocks and leaving the

2716
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:47,840
plants in and then just staggering your

2717
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:50,400
your planting pattern uh in a way where

2718
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:53,279
you plant in between

2719
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:54,158
i have a friend i can't remember which

2720
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:57,279
he

2721
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:58,399
awesome stuff online they have these

2722
01:42:57,279 --> 01:42:59,759
huge

2723
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:03,920
beds

2724
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:07,039
and um instead of you know actually even

2725
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:10,960
planting digging the holes he actually

2726
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:13,039
has uh pots that have no bottom on them

2727
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,079
so it is a fabric pot that doesn't have

2728
01:43:13,039 --> 01:43:18,238
a bottom and they basically just puts

2729
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:22,000
them into a

2730
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:25,439
open spot on the top of the bed and the

2731
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:28,158
roots grow down into the bed

2732
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:31,678
at the end when he harvests he actually

2733
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:33,599
leaves that pot in place

2734
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:36,399
chops the plant

2735
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:39,280
and then moves over to the space next to

2736
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:42,079
it and puts the next plant in

2737
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:45,679
and does that rotation and then

2738
01:43:42,079 --> 01:43:49,600
when that second plant comes down that

2739
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:51,679
first root ball plant is taken away

2740
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:54,719
because a lot of that underlying root

2741
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:57,118
base has then at that point been uh has

2742
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,880
decayed and broken down and you know if

2743
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:00,639
you're in a good living soil bed then

2744
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:03,039
the worms and everything else are taking

2745
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:04,639
care of all that stuff as well so

2746
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:06,479
highly recommend you taking that

2747
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:08,159
approach

2748
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:10,479
yeah that's interesting we we're doing

2749
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:11,519
that cloth pot tech for the first time

2750
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:14,879
this year

2751
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,960
we where we cut the bottoms off and

2752
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,719
we dug them in a little bit but

2753
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,480
you know we still have some to plant so

2754
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:24,399
maybe we'll just try leaving them right

2755
01:44:20,479 --> 01:44:26,718
on on the top that's an interesting

2756
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:26,719
thought

2757
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:30,799
yeah and then just pop the next one

2758
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:32,000
right next to it right like just go in

2759
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,960
between

2760
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,960
um

2761
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,800
you know uh leave you know you'll

2762
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,439
usually have space in between them and

2763
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:42,320
and just plant between um and then that

2764
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:45,279
plant will be able to take advantage of

2765
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:48,639
a lot of that stuff that's left over

2766
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:50,399
from that previous plant

2767
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:52,239
yeah and it's a good idea to do like if

2768
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:53,759
you're if you've got some compost teas

2769
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:56,079
and you're brewing up some microbes in

2770
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:59,039
that compost tea it's a good idea to

2771
01:44:56,079 --> 01:45:01,760
post harvest try to

2772
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:03,679
uh introduce like a a strong maybe a

2773
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:05,679
concentrated dose of that compost tea

2774
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:07,359
that's very rich in microbes to the

2775
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:09,440
plant that was harvested because those

2776
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:11,118
microbes are typically going to produce

2777
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:12,719
enzymes that will help hydrolyze the

2778
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:15,359
cell walls

2779
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,480
so as the cell walls get hydrolyzed and

2780
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:18,238
broken down

2781
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:20,000
they kind of get repurposed as building

2782
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:22,079
blocks into sugars that

2783
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,760
are solubilized and they they can you

2784
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:25,920
know be used for a number of different

2785
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:27,199
things including to feed the next

2786
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,199
generation of

2787
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:30,960
plants or even better to just keep the

2788
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:32,638
carbon stored in the soil in a soluble

2789
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:35,118
form and then just enhance the quality

2790
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:38,480
of life for all the beneficial microbes

2791
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:38,479
that uh that are in there

2792
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:42,158
that's great my you know one question

2793
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:42,960
i'd like to

2794
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:44,879
ask

2795
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:47,439
you know currently one of the things i'm

2796
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,520
dealing with because i've

2797
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:51,519
built all my soil you know from the

2798
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:52,159
ground up and didn't buy bagged soil and

2799
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,280
i

2800
01:45:52,158 --> 01:45:55,198
used

2801
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:58,559
organic dairy manure from the local

2802
01:45:55,198 --> 01:46:02,399
dairies and stuff i now have this

2803
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:03,679
quite large population of uh roly-polies

2804
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:04,638
that

2805
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:06,560
are

2806
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:08,639
last year for the first time they were

2807
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:11,600
actually up in my colas and i had to

2808
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:13,600
pull my crop two weeks early you know

2809
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:16,000
because they started

2810
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:18,000
having parties up there and taking shits

2811
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,760
and like causing issues so i'm just

2812
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,560
trying to figure out

2813
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:25,199
the best way to deal with these

2814
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:29,199
once ocean dwelling creatures that

2815
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:29,198
seem impossible to beat

2816
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:37,039
yeah that's um those are uh those are

2817
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,880
pests that actually have not had to deal

2818
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:41,359
with yet

2819
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:43,760
i've i've dealt with a lot of pests and

2820
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:46,399
doors unfortunately

2821
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:49,360
and um though that is not one of them i

2822
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:50,638
know that i know that there is a jadam

2823
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:52,880
approach

2824
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:55,840
somewhere in the jadam approach to cover

2825
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:58,800
that specific type of insect um so if

2826
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:01,199
you're looking at some of the the j a d

2827
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,480
a m organic farming

2828
01:47:01,198 --> 01:47:06,559
uh

2829
01:47:02,479 --> 01:47:09,519
recipes there is a bio control one for

2830
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:12,560
roly polies in there

2831
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:15,040
i'm not really sure what the natural

2832
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:17,119
predator would be that you would launch

2833
01:47:15,039 --> 01:47:19,760
for something like that

2834
01:47:17,118 --> 01:47:23,039
but it you know that's a type of

2835
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:26,000
uh insect that you need to

2836
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:29,439
probably deal with multiple parts of the

2837
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,560
life cycle and i also would be curious

2838
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:32,399
if the

2839
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:35,280
addition of

2840
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:38,559
predator nematodes would help

2841
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:39,599
with some of the earlier stages of life

2842
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:41,600
um

2843
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,760
you know getting them down you know when

2844
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:45,119
they're they're kind of hatching as eggs

2845
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,679
in the soil

2846
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:50,319
um or what i'm not quite sure what their

2847
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:51,760
life cycle is like how they're born or

2848
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:52,639
hatched

2849
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,039
so

2850
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:56,159
understanding the life cycle of the

2851
01:47:55,039 --> 01:47:58,158
insect

2852
01:47:56,158 --> 01:48:00,960
is usually a

2853
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:03,198
important way to to deal with it so that

2854
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:06,079
you can deal with not only

2855
01:48:03,198 --> 01:48:07,678
um you know the adults but also the

2856
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:10,319
larva

2857
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:12,319
and some of the midlife stages different

2858
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:14,960
predators

2859
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:17,118
have different uh will live in different

2860
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:20,079
zones during their life cycle so

2861
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:22,559
something like thrips

2862
01:48:20,079 --> 01:48:25,359
western flower thrips

2863
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:27,360
actually live in both the phylosphere

2864
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:29,839
and the rhizosphere

2865
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:32,880
during their life cycle

2866
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:34,719
usually we see the adults munching on

2867
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:37,118
our leaves

2868
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:39,118
causing problems there

2869
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:42,639
being vectors for disease and other

2870
01:48:39,118 --> 01:48:45,920
problems as you said leaving waste

2871
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:47,679
but the thrips themselves the they lay

2872
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:49,760
the eggs on the on the leaf on the

2873
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:52,239
undersides of the leaves and then the

2874
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:53,760
eggs when they hatch they fall down into

2875
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:57,759
the soil

2876
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:59,039
and so to truly deal with um

2877
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,039
thrips

2878
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:04,079
you need to deal with them in both the

2879
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:05,920
phylosphere and the rhizosphere

2880
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:08,158
and so you need to treat them with a

2881
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,000
combination of different types of

2882
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:11,319
predators to deal with those different

2883
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,599
sets

2884
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:16,479
stratiolap is also something that comes

2885
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:18,400
to mind michael because uh those are

2886
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:21,678
also a ground

2887
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:23,598
uh a surface dweller stradiolae lap rove

2888
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:24,639
beetles delosha

2889
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:27,279
um

2890
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:28,800
but um yeah i think possibly some of

2891
01:49:27,279 --> 01:49:30,639
those predator nematodes as well

2892
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,639
predator nematodes i mentioned earlier

2893
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:35,039
can also be sprayed

2894
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:37,199
so predator nematodes can

2895
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:40,079
attack some of those

2896
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:43,039
pests while they're in the phylosphere

2897
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:44,880
not just um i know most people

2898
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:46,960
you think of predator nematodes they

2899
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,880
think about putting them into the

2900
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,399
rhizosphere but they can be applied in

2901
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:53,760
the phylosphere

2902
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:55,598
so in addition to the dom i would check

2903
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:58,320
with one of the

2904
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:59,599
beneficial insectary sites

2905
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:01,759
one of the insectary sites like

2906
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:03,679
beneficial insectary is one

2907
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,550
arbico

2908
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:07,039
and see if they have some

2909
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:10,079
[Music]

2910
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:12,960
recommendations you could also look for

2911
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:16,880
i don't know if he's covered at peter uh

2912
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:20,239
but uh matthew gates has a show he's uh

2913
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:23,440
zenthanol uh so he's on

2914
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:25,279
uh instagram under uh

2915
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:27,919
sink angel

2916
01:50:25,279 --> 01:50:31,198
but he's also on the future cannabis

2917
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:33,118
project with a ipm specific show

2918
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:35,519
which you might be able to check out and

2919
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:37,439
talk to matthew gates

2920
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:39,840
to see if he can also help you with your

2921
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:39,839
problem

2922
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:45,598
appreciate it thanks for all the info

2923
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:48,239
you're welcome you're welcome

2924
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:50,480
anybody else down in the audience has

2925
01:50:48,238 --> 01:50:52,559
questions comments wants to come up and

2926
01:50:50,479 --> 01:50:55,359
talk about anything we covered tonight

2927
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:58,159
on the rhizosphere of the phylosphere uh

2928
01:50:55,359 --> 01:51:01,118
or just some general stuff feel free to

2929
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:03,519
go ahead and raise your hand and come up

2930
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:05,359
uh was there anything specific to the

2931
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,840
rhizosphere that you wanted to get into

2932
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:07,839
tonight nick

2933
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,440
no i mean i think we covered most of the

2934
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:13,760
things that we wanted to cover it seems

2935
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:15,678
like the filo sphere is the one that

2936
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,239
is a little bit unique for people you

2937
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:20,880
know hopefully you heard about it it

2938
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:22,959
inspired you to think a little bit about

2939
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,880
um what's going on up there and then you

2940
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,960
know maybe how it's connected

2941
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:29,118
to the rhizosphere physically or also

2942
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:31,198
metaphorically you know there's a saying

2943
01:51:29,118 --> 01:51:32,319
as above so below and this is one of

2944
01:51:31,198 --> 01:51:35,439
those

2945
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:36,799
perfect instances where it's applicable

2946
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:38,319
to say that there's a lot of stuff

2947
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:40,639
happening in the roots that is also

2948
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:43,279
happening in the leaf surfaces and in a

2949
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:44,880
similar way i think the uh

2950
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:46,399
you know the the trick will be to try to

2951
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,880
figure out how do you take good care of

2952
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:50,559
the air quality for your phylosphere

2953
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:52,719
just like the question has been how do

2954
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,239
you take good care of your soil for the

2955
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:56,319
rhizosphere

2956
01:51:54,238 --> 01:51:59,118
so yeah i think we got into all the

2957
01:51:56,319 --> 01:52:00,840
things that we wanted to cover

2958
01:51:59,118 --> 01:52:04,079
awesome and

2959
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:06,159
brian thank you for joining us how are

2960
01:52:04,079 --> 01:52:10,000
you doing tonight sir

2961
01:52:06,158 --> 01:52:12,479
uh did you have a question or comment i

2962
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,520
see you're a no-till living soil

2963
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:17,759
backyard greenhouse cannabis grower

2964
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,800
in minnesota

2965
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:20,079
right no

2966
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:22,079
sorry

2967
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:24,238
orange exposed me

2968
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:27,039
it cut off the letters cut off and for

2969
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:29,279
some reason my brain went mn but thank

2970
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:32,079
you in oregon uh how are you doing

2971
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:34,639
tonight brian welcome doing fine uh i

2972
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:37,279
had a comment on uh

2973
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:39,840
the rolly pollies because i had i've had

2974
01:52:37,279 --> 01:52:42,559
to deal with them in the past

2975
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:46,719
uh i have a similar situation with the

2976
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:49,599
fabric pots mine are 65 gallon pots but

2977
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:52,158
i did not cut the bottoms out of them

2978
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,840
uh i've had them for years

2979
01:52:52,158 --> 01:52:56,719
probably like five years in my

2980
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:59,360
greenhouse which has a bed of gravel

2981
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:03,118
underneath of it but like i said they're

2982
01:52:59,359 --> 01:53:05,519
not cut out anyway the roly-polies

2983
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:08,799
the life cycle seems to be independent

2984
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:11,199
of my pots because i've had i've seen

2985
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:13,039
them they come in and they come out of

2986
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:13,919
the greenhouse they just

2987
01:53:13,039 --> 01:53:15,359
you know

2988
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,440
they're everywhere

2989
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:20,079
but i've never had a problem except for

2990
01:53:17,439 --> 01:53:22,238
one year and that was the first year and

2991
01:53:20,079 --> 01:53:24,479
i had no cover crop

2992
01:53:22,238 --> 01:53:26,718
i didn't know about cover crop and i

2993
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:28,879
have a similar soil like what this guy

2994
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:30,560
was talking about where i mixed it

2995
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:32,400
together myself out of all the

2996
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,520
ingredients

2997
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:35,598
and

2998
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:38,000
so that year i had problems where they

2999
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:40,239
were actually nibbling on the stalks of

3000
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,639
my plants and

3001
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:45,919
that's the only time i've ever seen them

3002
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:47,760
on my plants at all because since then

3003
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:51,760
i had this like

3004
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:53,360
11 seed mix cover crop mix specifically

3005
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:56,000
for cannabis

3006
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:58,479
and since then i've only seen them in

3007
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,359
the cover crop

3008
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:01,919
awesome

3009
01:53:59,359 --> 01:54:03,759
really didn't have a problem since then

3010
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:08,359
yeah i know um

3011
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:08,360
like mites love clover

3012
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:13,679
yeah there's three different kinds of

3013
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:16,158
clover in this mix yeah

3014
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:21,359
yeah fantastic fantastic

3015
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:23,839
um i i'm a big fan of uh of like vetch

3016
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:25,439
uh some of the grasses

3017
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,199
but yeah there's definitely some nice

3018
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:30,879
mixes out there

3019
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:34,158
there's also almost every seed company

3020
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:36,639
uh natural farming seed company like

3021
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:39,118
baker creek or any other ones they all

3022
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:40,960
also sell

3023
01:54:39,118 --> 01:54:45,279
cover crop mixes

3024
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:47,920
that have peas and vetch and grasses and

3025
01:54:45,279 --> 01:54:50,800
clovers and all sorts of good things is

3026
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:53,440
is that uh um that mixer using something

3027
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:54,719
that you come up you came up with or

3028
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:58,000
something that you

3029
01:54:54,719 --> 01:55:00,000
yeah i i ordered it i found it online i

3030
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,800
think i just searched on amazon it's

3031
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,880
like an 11 seed mix it has yeah i think

3032
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:07,520
it's four types of clover but it does

3033
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:10,880
have hairy vetch and another kind of

3034
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:13,280
it has uh beans some other things

3035
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:14,719
uh but what here's the thing is it seems

3036
01:55:13,279 --> 01:55:16,880
like

3037
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:20,319
it's the it's the canary and the coal

3038
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:22,960
mine for me because the only time

3039
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:25,920
you know i had problem with mites before

3040
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:29,679
they came up in my cover crop and they

3041
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:31,840
never once got to my plant that was when

3042
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:34,399
i had things under control

3043
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:35,520
not last year but the year before that

3044
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:37,519
and

3045
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:40,400
they didn't yeah last year everything

3046
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:43,520
went south because my blue mat system

3047
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:46,079
somehow my reservoir went dry things

3048
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:49,119
just went off the rails and so i had

3049
01:55:46,079 --> 01:55:51,599
russet mites and spider mites so i think

3050
01:55:49,118 --> 01:55:53,839
last year doesn't really count

3051
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:57,679
yeah prior to that everything was in

3052
01:55:53,840 --> 01:56:01,039
pretty good equilibrium in my greenhouse

3053
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:03,599
yeah the um i love the blue mats but um

3054
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:06,238
it is hard especially if you let them go

3055
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:09,119
dry to get them back to where they need

3056
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:11,598
to be you have to re-get the soil back

3057
01:56:09,118 --> 01:56:14,399
to that level and then you gotta re-dial

3058
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:15,679
in each one of those individual carrots

3059
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:19,279
and

3060
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:21,118
it can be a little bit of a challenge uh

3061
01:56:19,279 --> 01:56:23,679
sometimes working with those blue mats

3062
01:56:21,118 --> 01:56:25,198
although i do i do appreciate them and i

3063
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,760
think that is

3064
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:31,359
probably one of the best ways to keep

3065
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:35,039
the rhizosphere happy is that

3066
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:39,118
you know that that ability to only

3067
01:56:35,039 --> 01:56:41,920
give the right amount of water

3068
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:45,039
to keep the right amount of water in the

3069
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:47,118
zone in each of those zones all the time

3070
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:49,679
yeah i highly recommend the blue mat

3071
01:56:47,118 --> 01:56:52,319
system especially the blue soak i have

3072
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:53,199
both the drippers and the the blue soak

3073
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:56,319
tape

3074
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:58,479
and it works like a charm like i said

3075
01:56:56,319 --> 01:57:00,719
it's worked for me great for years but

3076
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:03,359
last year it was my own fault you know i

3077
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:06,000
let the reservoir run dry because i shut

3078
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:08,639
the water off for some crazy reason

3079
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,520
and other than that you know it's been

3080
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:14,719
great for me

3081
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:17,360
yeah that maybe that's why the the uh

3082
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:20,560
roly-poly stay down there i noticed they

3083
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:22,079
like to hang around the the blue soak

3084
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,840
tank

3085
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:25,198
so

3086
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:27,440
yeah the environment they appreciate the

3087
01:57:25,198 --> 01:57:29,439

gonna try to pop in if i can for a

3146
01:59:49,439 --> 01:59:54,079
little bit and just listen because it's

3147
01:59:51,039 --> 01:59:56,000
a topic that intrigues me so i'd like to

3148

from being able to catch the rebroadcast

3157
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:21,118
of the show if you happen to miss it

3158
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:24,560
uh something to uh maybe fall asleep to

3159
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:27,198
uh after spending the whole day at uh in
