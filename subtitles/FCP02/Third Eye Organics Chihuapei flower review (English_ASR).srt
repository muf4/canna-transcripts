[Applause]

3
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:10,000
[Music]

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,798
what's up everybody this is og as my

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,120
oxygen packs of the future here what's

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,039
up what's up and today we're here to

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,600
talk about some third eye organics which

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,880
we are both very excited about packs of

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,960
the future can tell you a little more

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,799
about third eye organics but they are a

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,880
very very special set of growers

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,439
yeah so i think right now at least in la

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,000
third eye is one of the cultivators that

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
people are most excited about we are

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,439
absolutely included we've had the

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,480
pleasure of trying their runts

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,199
their sour dub their wookies their

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,558
starburst og and now a lot og is my

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
oxygen tell you about we're gonna be

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:51,439
trying today yeah so today we've got the

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:54,959
chiwape which is a sour diesel slash

22
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:57,759
very berry cross um i believe it's a

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,399
very very cush actually so again that is

24
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,558
sour diesel crossed with very barry kush

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
um and just opening up the jar and

26
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,959
smelling it

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,919
i get a lot of sour and diesel and gas

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,798
and

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
uh

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,080
it's it's really dank i mean uh it

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
definitely is strong on the sour diesel

32
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,519
that's for sure

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,360
yeah so third eye is really considered

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,280
by a lot of people i'd say

35
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,840
uh to be one of the master cultivators

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,759
right now this is some of uh in a lot of

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240
people's mind the most exciting smoke

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,799
going around and from the nose and the

39
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,959
visual you you can tell what people are

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,040
so excited about the

41
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,879
the terpro profile is very strong

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,799
there's there's a blueberry like a dj

43
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,599
short blueberry thing going on but there

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,000
is a backbone of like a hindu cushiness

45
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,679
a dark note as well i also i kind of get

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,719
raspberries a bit um

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,840
the the

48
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,359
fruity berry bouquet is is more complex

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,118
than you get um

50
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,239
in a lot of representations of that terp

51
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,078
profile

52
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,239
definitely

53
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,438
um and so i was actually able to try

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,078
some third eye organics ogre farms

55
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,878
chiwape rosin i believe it was live

56
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,359
rosin uh day before we got these jars

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,679
and the terps on that were incredibly

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,599
strong incredibly present just

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
absolutely tickling the palette and the

60
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,119
nasal cavity

61
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,318
one of those one of those dabs that you

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,879
hit and just it completely coats your

63
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,519
entire sinus cavity and your

64
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,039
uh your entire palate it's it's very

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
much a

66
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,919
full takeover of the senses when you

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,000
smoke the chihuahua rosin and uh we feel

68
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,199
that way about the chiwape flour we

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,199
rolled ourselves up a doobie right here

70
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,280
we like to roll the joints thicker

71
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,000
rather than skinnier to get a better

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,318
flavor on the joint it's just how it is

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,318
you know

74
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,318
wow okay so my first impression on the

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,319
dry puff of this

76
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,719
i get those raspberries that you were

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,560
talking about i get citrus

78
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,959
i get

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,959
some more of those nose-tickly kind of

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
fuel-y turps but they really blend in

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,759
with the the citrus to me but it tastes

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,920
really good it tastes super bomb yeah i

83
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,759
get like raspberry and lime

84
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,799
yeah definitely lime to go with that

85
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,120
citrus

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
you know how sometimes at fruit carts on

87
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,120
the street they'll squeeze lime over the

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,200
whole thing yeah yeah yeah sort of that

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,920
vibe almost like the lime the lime on

90
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,919
the watermelon

91
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:30,798
excellent

92
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,639
fire

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,439
all right well i'll light this up

94
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,439
see how she does

95
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,359
it's the light up cam

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,680
gotta use the torch yeah i love using a

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,840
torch lighter

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
personally for me it works better

99
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,119
some people make the

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,640
unfortunate mistake of burning the paper

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,719
a little too much with the torch lighter

102
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,958
and that can

103
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:02,000
hinder a joint

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,840
prone to uh

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,840
air air flow problems but

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,719
ultimately i find this lights at the

107
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,359
best especially on the fatty joints

108
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,359
yeah well we're not using uh this tech

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,160
right now third eye advocates for using

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,879
the gumless club paper yeah which is a

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,800
super interesting uh another way to just

112
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,639
sort of enhance the terps even further

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
so if you have any thoughts about what

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,600
papers we should be using to roll up

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,000
if it is end up being the glumless club

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
paper we'd be stoked let us know in the

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,720
comments but we're definitely always

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,560
trying to have the best smoking

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,040
experience possible right now we're

120
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
using our favorite element papers i'm

121
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,560
gonna pass this over

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,560
so

123
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,519
what's your first impression off the bat

124
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,360
having one hit

125
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,198
my first impression is that the smoke is

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,560
getting in my beard

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
but otherwise

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,959
definitely fruity uh more of the diesel

129
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,919
than you get in the nose i'd say is

130
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,198
present in the in the smoke yeah i

131
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,639
personally haven't had the pleasure of

132
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
trying all the different sour diesels

133
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,038
and i don't know the difference between

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,519
the soma versus the aj versus the the

135
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,038
east coast but there is that

136
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,439
petrolly

137
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,800
fuelly quality um and then there's a

138
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,639
nice berry

139
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,120
element as well it almost tastes like a

140
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,519
strawberry soda it's very

141
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,918
sour and sweet

142
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,240
and definitely fuelly

143
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,399
very very terpy

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
excited to to go in and

145
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,879
maybe have something more articulate to

146
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,959
say in a second totally i definitely get

147
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,959
that diesel in it and when i

148
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,439
it similarly to when i hit the rosin

149
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,918
hitting the joint definitely

150
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,959
um coats the pallet with the

151
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,719
diesely type terps first and foremost um

152
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,879
letting the flavor kind of settle into

153
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,800
my pallet after smoking it and after

154
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,240
having exhaled as well

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,680
i definitely caught notes of the

156
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
raspberries that we were getting earlier

157
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,560
in our dry puff um i feel like the

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,639
diesel and the lime kind of play into

159
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,199
each other in terms of the tickle your

160
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,600
palate terps um

161
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,560
and as you smoke it it becomes um

162
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,960
it becomes kind of a nice synergy

163
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
you know and i think as as the flavor is

164
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,959
is starting to wash over me more and i'm

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,479
getting a better sense of it i i haven't

166
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:27,038
had a pleasure of trying a lot of the

167
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,719
uh fruity hash plant strains that people

168
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,038
are excited about right now i know a lot

169
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,720
of them are coming from bodhi this to me

170
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,639
is what i'd imagine like the raspberry

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,000
hash plant would taste like there's a

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,240
deep rich dank um diesel for sure but

173
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,439
also just

174
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,478
hashy i would say a flavor that i'm

175
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,800
enjoying a ton and with third eye

176
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,719
we did roll up a nice sized joint here

177
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,400
you really can get away with rolling

178
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,599
pinners because this is some of the

179
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,758
strongest

180
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,800
the strongest weed around in my opinion

181
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,960
and so

182
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,960
i think that that hashy resinous flavor

183
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,959
makes sense

184
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,038
definitely um

185
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,439
and you know they're

186
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,639
growing this plant

187
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,800
really for excellent resin um

188
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,360
uh a term that we like to throw around

189
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,598
is keep on a leaf and this is no key

190
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,360
funnel leaf it definitely has that

191
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,560
flavor

192
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,000
you're both

193
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,560
you know spending more time hitting it

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,478
than we are talking which is a good sign

195
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,439
i i know that i'm about to get super

196
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,120
super stoned but at the moment

197
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,199
i'm really just feeling a light body

198
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,959
high like a light

199
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,439
sort of sedative thing coming over my

200
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,439
shoulders

201
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,240
and i'm definitely starting to feel

202
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,239
a bit relaxed

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,360
i'd say the primary feeling for me is

204
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,759
also in my shoulders which is

205
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,000
interesting like along this part of my

206
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,560
shoulders on both sides and then also

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,519
like in my

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,680
kind of back of my jaw area some weed

209
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,000
for me is you know very much behind the

210
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,800
eyes and the forehead and the face this

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,199
one i really feel in my shoulders and in

212
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,319
my jaw compared to that in terms of the

213
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,639
immediate kind of uh noticeable

214
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,800
effects and effect points

215
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,038
but i hear it we're both getting stoned

216
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,639
we're both starting to draw

217
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,038
a little bit which is nice i mean it's

218
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,519
what you want and especially when you're

219
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,159
getting weed that is is of this quality

220
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,598
um for the most part i'd say the people

221
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,400
that are have the pleasure of smoking

222
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,478
third eye really did have to seek it out

223
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,839
um and and when you sort of go through

224
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,199
that effort to get your hands on a

225
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,759
product you want it to be this

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,839
immediately impactful yeah uh one of the

227
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,918
cool things about almost all of the weed

228
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,000
i've smoked from third eye is it feels

229
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:45,039
very euphoric

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,958
sometimes weed for me can have an edgy

231
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,159
feeling or sometimes you know some

232
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,239
people might describe that as getting

233
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,879
too high or whatever

234
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,959
this stuff is very euphoric

235
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,080
more like uh

236
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,000
more like

237
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,879
being like wrapped in a warm blanket

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,399
than

239
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,879
being like

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,679
shocked in the face with some crazy you

241
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,600
know

242
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,719
foreign sensation

243
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,519
it's uh

244
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,720
it's really like uh to sum it up just

245
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,039
very pleasant

246
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,959
psychedelic without being panicky yeah

247
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,719
totally it's uplifting i think that

248
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,838
while we both do feel this thing on our

249
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,879
shoulders and

250
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,600
with it having a at the very very cush

251
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:26,159
in it you would expect there to be

252
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,800
um sort of a relaxing sedative profile

253
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,159
but there also is this cerebral buzz and

254
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,719
i i do feel um

255
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,360
not energized but very alive

256
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,399
definitely

257
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,919
i resonate with that for sure

258
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,679
i i think that anyone who has the

259
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,958
opportunity to go out and get third eye

260
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,479
organics

261
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,879
it is a treat

262
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,879
um there are a lot of really amazing

263
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,439
growers that are

264
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,799
operating at this high of a level and i

265
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
think that

266
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,439
if you can try try all of them but

267
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,279
certainly the

268
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
third eye is very special

269
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,159
the third eye is indoor

270
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,440
indoor organic living soil

271
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,958
and

272
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
ultimately you know

273
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,319
the

274
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,199
weed speaks for itself but we can only

275
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,200
do so much to communicate the experience

276
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,640
of trying third eye

277
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,040
yeah if you're lucky enough to try these

278
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,720
terps i'd say go ahead we're always

279
