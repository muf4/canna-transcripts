1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,879
hey a few more African sativa field

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,759
notes it's very exciting to see that

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,580
these Africans are finally going off and

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,960
getting close to finishing so this I'd

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,599
have to say

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,880
as a plant now I haven't sampled any of

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,379
these the final like effects of the

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,618
dried flowers because we haven't Harvest

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:26,399
them but this is from Kenya and we grew

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:29,219
a bunch of Kenyan lambre seeds this year

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:32,820
in fact we've got one

12
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:36,058
two three four five so we have five

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,899
female Kenyans and they all are fairly

14
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:42,899
uniform in this just really nice

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,660
sort of globular structure just covered

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,420
in sphere so it's actually a very um

17
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:51,058
efficient design for yield so this could

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,260
actually be sort of a productiony type

19
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:54,320
plant

20
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,320
um

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,878
weird

22
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:02,419
wow uh so

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,420
kind of what hit was

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,219
almost a little vulgar kind of a almost

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,939
body odor

26
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:16,319
smell but you know like a pheromone

27
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:19,919
musky primal

28
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,419
sort of body odor funk that's a little

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
intoxicating

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,719
uh let me see

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,420
wow but also herbs Savory herbs

32
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,219
with some body odor funk I know that

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,719
sounds disgusting but it's actually kind

34
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:39,920
of intoxicating here's another Canyon

35
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:43,978
you know that kind of that has that same

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,719
little bit of funk going on

37
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,719
just kind of a body odor thing

38
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,719
and then um

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,280
yeah they they all to tell you the truth

40
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,439
these are kind of somewhat uh

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,500
uniform these are probably the most

42
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:04,618
uniform plants all five of these phenos

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,680
really are very

44
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:06,680
clear

45
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,739
close see

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,300
this is the most done one I'd say this

47
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,039
one's ready to be harvested could be

48
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,560
even harvested right now

49
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,199
but may let it go I don't see a speck of

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,780
mold on any of these as these are

51
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,519
African sativas which tend to not have

52
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,598
mold issues

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
um

54
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,639
but yeah are you able to get Crystal on

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,560
there no I'm getting maybe the ladybugs

56
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,378
oh okay maybe

57
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,580
there's one I'm gonna just kind of hang

58
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:37,579
out and see yeah

59
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,519
anyway hope that helped

60
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,519

beautiful beautiful beautiful gorgeous

63
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,979
plant again these are field notes for

64
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,979
our own record but we're sharing them

65
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,238
