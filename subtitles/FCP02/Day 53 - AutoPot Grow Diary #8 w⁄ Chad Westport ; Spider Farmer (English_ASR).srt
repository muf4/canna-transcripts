1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
[ __ ] you was born

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,218
[Applause]

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,219
[Music]

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:22,320
[Music]

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,100
hey everybody Chad lesport here and we

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,099
are on day 53 of flower in my auto pot

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,140
grow and we are getting darn close to

8
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,880
the end and you can probably see that by

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,340
the looks on some of the plants things

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,079
are senessing and I have been checking

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,000
the trichome heads again that's really

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,859
the best measurement of when to harvest

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,899
your plant now everybody's going to have

14
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,939
a different ratio that they prefer but

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:50,340
let's just generically speak generically

16
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:52,439
speaking 10 clear 10 Amber 80 cloudy

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,840
that's when it's time to harvest and

18
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,579
again you want to check the trichomes on

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,859
the buds you don't want to check them on

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,539
the leaves the least tend to mature

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,600
faster so you'll see more Amber on the

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,239
Leafs than you will the buds but knowing

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,519
that sometimes when you start to see a

24
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,919
lot of Amber on the leaves if you like

25
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,079
to flush yeah you know it's probably

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,379
about time to flush because the buds are

27
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,179
going to be maturing soon after that so

28
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,640
I've been keeping an eye on these things

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,040
I'm happy with the way it's going the

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,180
auto pot grow challenge under the spider

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,640
farmer SE 5000 light 480 Watts guys it's

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,759
in a 4x4 tent gives me and my wife

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,040
plenty of medicine so let's go in and

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,959
take a look at these buds the Kool-Aid

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,719
Man definitely put it on heavy into

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,000
lowers and then as you can see as it

37
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,519
gets to the upper portions

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,759
stacked some pretty nice colas on here

39
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:52,640
so I'm stoked about that

40
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,640
it's a close-up shot of the Kool-Aid Man

41
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,339
it's a Kool-Aid Man

42
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,199
so here's the Westport grape juice in

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,420
the back of the tent and you know like I

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,640
said on day 53 these things are looking

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,878
good they're looking pretty much done

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,219
but I know another week on them so this

47
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,679
is the Westport grape juice in the back

48
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,560
of the tent and then we got our Westport

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,400
grape juice up here in the front of the

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,020
tent as well

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,480
nice chunky buds you know I love the

52
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,540
Westport grape juice again even despite

53
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,759
the weight of these it doesn't need any

54
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,159
you know netting or trellising they're

55
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:39,000
standing up on its own nice strong

56
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,139
plants I really dig these Westport grape

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,680
juices

58
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,919
yummy close-up of the Westport grape

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920
juice

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,080
as you can see these Westport grape

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,378
juice they like to get Chunky buds they

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,660
like to stack so these things definitely

63
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:04,378
are swollen

64
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:07,560
day 53 in the back here we have our Twin

65
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:10,280
Peaks and as you can see oh this one is

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,280
definitely sinessing

67
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:18,598
all good uh the buds are nice and

68
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,700
plentiful so this is the Twin Peaks here

69
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,459
in the back of the tent and again it

70
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:26,518
kind of all fell forward into the uh

71
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,900
Kool-Aid man here at the end could use a

72
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,739
little bit of support a little bit of

73
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,560
netting uh but usually it stands its own

74
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,519
weight but uh doing good that's the Twin

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,739
Peaks

76
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,599
let's get a close-up of that closer look

77
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,599
at one of the Twin Peak buds

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,580
there you have it I'm gonna have some

79
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:54,180
chunky Frosty fragrant buds here to

80
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,219
smoke very soon but looking at the

81
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,900
trichomes again I want to let them go

82
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:01,199
probably about another seven days it's

83
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,000
day 53 I generally pull things at day 60

84
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,859
and these are strains that I've run

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,840
before so I know they fit that window

86
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,879
something that I look for in my tent

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,759
it's important when it comes to rotation

88
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,098
if you have a bunch of 60 day plants and

89
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,479
then you have a 12 weaker well that's

90
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,159
going to throw your whole schedule off

91
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,099
so when you're planning your next run

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,900
think about that check the genetics know

93
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,120
how long they're gonna run and then you

94
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,939
can keep that Perpetual cycle going you

95
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,540
know always be vegan always be flowering

96
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:33,060
something we like to do and I appreciate

97
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,160

98

girl guide probably one more video I'll

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,120
do a pre-harvest video and maybe a

100
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,199
harvest video something on drying and

101
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,199
curing but this is how it looks Stokes
