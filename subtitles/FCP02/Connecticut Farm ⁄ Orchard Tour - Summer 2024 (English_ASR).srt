1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
[Music]

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,960
you want to go inside yeah we're going

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,039
to do a tour so why don't we start up

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,880
here and then you can get to the pwn

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,599
story all right well we're on the

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:24,599
Connecticut Rhode Island

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:28,880
border and we are on 30 Acres of

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:31,839
Woodland so kill it we have Japanese

9
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,719
invasive Japanese Japanese Beatles that

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,039
Gemma is going to take care in charge of

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,679
she's the Grim

12
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,600
Reaper um so this is the house that is

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:46,119
here it's from

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,039
1802 uh the original house this are

15
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:50,959
perennial flower gardens going on around

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,840
here so did you put all these in

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,079
recently no these were here but uh the

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,280
issue was that um so we got this two and

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,920
a half years ago the issue was that the

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,640
person we got it from was very old and

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,079
was all by herself and hadn't been able

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,640
to take care of anything for about 20

23
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:19,359
years so we had um just an insane amount

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,200
of invasives that we've been clearing

25
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:25,400
out uh such as multifloral Rose and

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,159
Oriental

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,439
Bittersweet and other things that are

28
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,960
just nasty and

29
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:40,000
overwhelm stuff

30
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:44,319
um Y and uh and so we've just been

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,799
trying to fight that back um which we

32
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:52,718
have pretty much succeeded around here

33
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:55,240
and have discovered stuff like uh if you

34
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:58,679
give this a smell it's like a mint it's

35
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:03,599
a lemon balm so Min family yeah I love

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:08,399
it home randomly we discovered it

37
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:11,199
um this is nice it's just Elderberry so

38
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,560
we'll make jams out of

39
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,199
it um and I think you can make like a

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,680
like isn't there a yeast that grows on

41
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,399
the outside of these and then you can

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,360
make like a you can jar it up and then

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,640
it ferments and uh creates a sparkling

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:34,239
that I do not know but I will look it up

45
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,958
uh um but uh you know the Box Hedges

46
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,239
were here but anyway this whole thing

47
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:42,800
was just a crazy mess and it's actually

48
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,920
been very cool to watch it from um kind

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,719
of April May onwards because you know it

50
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:52,799
all dies back uh it's very little Woody

51
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:55,840
stuff that stays up and uh and it's just

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,120
kind of like big mud patches coming

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,920
through the spring and we have a couple

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,000
of these sort of GI giant hostas which

55
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:08,000
are are pretty cool um but this is

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,799
something that we're going to tackle

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,239
this is burning bush which is just

58
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,840
everywhere and grows everywhere it has a

59
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:20,080
berri is it invasive or it's invasive

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:24,199
it's beautiful um but it's invasive and

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,080
uh you know we want to have it for um

62
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:30,598
for privacy from the from the very

63
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,560
well-traveled dirt road out there uh

64
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:36,158
invas uh invasive means that what is

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,360
invasive oh this plant here this is a

66
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:42,158
burning bush it turns a fiery red in the

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,799
fall but so our current thinking is that

68
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,120
we're going to replace these with

69
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,879
something called mock orange yeah um

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,480
that is a dragonfly probably yeah that's

71
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:56,239
definitely uh we have a couple of

72
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,318
different cool species of

73
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,519
dragonflies

74
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,719
um and and uh but anyway it's a lovely

75
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,719
little

76
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:13,840
spot uh this grape here

77
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:16,918
uh there's a concord grape oh nice uh

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,798
yeah so these guys are coming in are you

79
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,639
excited and I am excited did you eat

80
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,120
them last year or no yeah they're

81
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,360
totally tasty but we're going to bring

82
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,439
it down and probably train we started

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,280
training it along that um the wall chain

84
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:34,879
link oh the chain link yeah

85
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:36,918
uh that is a big butterfly it's probably

86
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,399
a butterfly moths usually I think come

87
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:44,599
out more in the late Twilight

88
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:46,679
hours um but uh we have a lot so we have

89
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,879
a lot we we do have a bunch of concord

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,680
grapes and then we just have a lot of

91
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,199
wild grapes so it's kind of figuring out

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,280
between the two because the wild grapes

93
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,478
are just like a big seed

94
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:02,038
pack mildly tasty but it's a lot of

95
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,959
seeds to spit out yeah yeah yeah um I I

96
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:07,159
you know what I can uh give you I have a

97
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:10,079
whole bunch of koho grapes growing uhhuh

98
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,800
and uh they're super tasty and each one

99
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,680
has I think like one seed in it uh

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,840
that's good uh it's yeah it's going to

101
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,680
get various cultivars because wherever

102
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,879
there's well we're just their they're

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,280
babies so wherever we

104
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:27,120
see wherever we see you know wild grapes

105
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,599
growing and stuff it's like okay we know

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,120
grapes grow here doesn't mean every

107
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,840
cultiv our will grow here here but we

108
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:38,079
know it's grape friendly and we can

109
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:40,679
bring in some cultivars and uh and sort

110
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,279
of pick and choose I'll show you a giant

111
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,800
grape vine

112
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:50,478
Gemma

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,280
um you know so this is this is all uh a

114
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:57,199
burning bush um and it pops up

115
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,279
everywhere but this keeps um you know

116
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
the erosion control so it's like before

117
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,719
we move moving it it's like what would

118
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
we put in it yeah let me show you the

119
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:13,160
bathtub and then I can tell you you had

120
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:13,159
a question about the

121
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,360
pond it wasn't a funny story uh or the

122
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,359
funny thing was the

123
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:35,279
bathtub so if you see that what's all

124
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:37,598
this uh lavender oh cool um and then

125
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,559
this was this was going to be some look

126
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:43,319
these all right ready wait that's so

127
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,519
scary you got it hurry up ah wait

128
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,479
there's two I know they were making love

129
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:51,719
so this was going to be

130
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:53,639
cilantro okay they don't bite they don't

131
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,080
bite Gemma so this was going to be

132
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:01,519
cilantro and we put the you know stuff

133
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,519
in and instead we're getting a melon or

134
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:08,559
a squash um but anyway if you look at

135
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,519
this railing here so this house was

136
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,560
1802 they didn't have Plumbing in

137
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,038
1802 so this little thing right here is

138
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,800
the B that looks like a pretty awesome

139
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:20,719
bathtub that was the bathtub have you

140
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,918
done it I haven't about two year two

141
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,800
summers ago there was a big drought and

142
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,519
uh the Water had stopped running through

143
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,240
and we wanted to scrub it clean but we

144
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:34,279
didn't get around to do do it uh I think

145
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,439
they kind of made it so it would do it

146
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,198
but yeah we need to hop in that so

147
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:43,199
anyway so this part of the pond they dug

148
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:46,319
out and the stream that comes in is on

149
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
the right hand side

150
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,478
there poison nope I got rid of it for

151
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,000
you Uncle Michael with his bare hands

152
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:03,079
removed all the poison ivy lots of

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,800
poison on your a uh what do you call it

154
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,318
when you no longer get imunity an

155
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,079
immunity to it so we have this little

156
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:15,280
pump that draws from the pond and Waters

157
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:19,439
everything up there nice uh and then

158
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,839
these guys here are the wild grapes that

159
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,598
are

160
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:28,638
everywhere

161
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:31,439
um and then by uh so this was a a Wild

162
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,439
Grape Vine

163
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:40,718
see very big wa doesn't come down yet

164
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,800
though um and I'm starting to punch into

165
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,920
here because we want to reclaim this if

166
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,439
you just see how dense it

167
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,159
is

168
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,480
um

169
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,240
Tomatoes oh I want some Tomatoes okay

170
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,159
follow

171
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,278
them so these Tomatoes were from the

172
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,600
compost bin uh we opened up the bin and

173
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,639
there there are a bunch of tomatoes

174
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,360
growing and I figured instead of just

175
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,199
tossing them we'll see what happens

176
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,839
right here and there's just probably

177
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,360
store bought tomatoes and they're

178
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:16,120
growing what's

179
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,519
this uh I do not know what that is um

180
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,039
but they're growing and then I was

181
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,200
wondering if it was like some GMO tomato

182
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:25,958
that only fruits once uh but there's

183
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,720
it's coming out and I don't really care

184
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:32,278
if the animals get to it so if we get to

185
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,680
it first get to it if not but this is

186
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,958
kind of what this is what that flower

187
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,078
garden looked

188
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:42,319
like uh just binds over everything binds

189
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:45,078
over stuff I mean it's you know this is

190
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,480
grape uh but then if you start putting

191
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:51,679
your hands in it gets very pricker and

192
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,240
um uh with the multifloral

193
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:57,599
rose

194
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:02,240
uh here we've put in so this spot here

195
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,159
was a big jungle like that we cleared it

196
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,959
out and we

197
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,600
have put in some little baby cherry

198
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:16,000
trees cherry tree cherry

199
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:18,480
tree so for context the ultimate goal is

200
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,120
a an orchard

201
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:26,600
for seasonal fruits for white mustache

202
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,399
yogurt correct uh but and this is more

203
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,399
this area is just more kind of you get

204
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,480
get the vibe that like oh there's fruit

205
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,839
growing because we want to do everything

206
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,480
further where everything's in the woods

207
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,760
but we have cherry tree cherry tree

208
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,680
cherry tree this is a black cherry that

209
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,720
was originally there and I want to see

210
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,439
if once we have cherries around it if

211
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,079
that will actually fruit black cherry

212
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,200
over

213
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,439
there

214
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,200
HT that's okay that's just a actually

215
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,519
that's a wing of

216
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,440
something um

217
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:06,679
we have a plum over

218
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:12,160
there uh sorry that one right there that

219
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:16,078
one that's uh um fenced in is a plum

220
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:18,600
yeah and then all of this is just native

221
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,559
Blackberry yeah I'd cut it all down

222
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,360
actually so this all has popped up since

223
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,759
the

224
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,278
springtime and I figure you know see how

225
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,879
they taste I have a couple of thornless

226
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,958
blackberry uh that I've planted here

227
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,639
they taste fine they're just a pain in

228
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:37,278
the butt to try to if if you were like

229
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm going to harvest all of this for Jam

230
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,078
it's a little bit of a pain uh and it

231
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,000
just grows dense and you can look at how

232
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:48,078
kind of prickly it is but the

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,600
blackberries taste you know decent um

234
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,359
and the issue that's where you get your

235
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,839
child labor you got two kids you got

236
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,399
nieces and nephew the one of the issues

237
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,480
is that it's a Bramble and it will just

238
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,839
kind of it just pops up everywhere so

239
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,278
it's trying to how do you kind of

240
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,760
contain it in one area which is just

241
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:12,679
sort of keep on chopping where it's

242
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:14,039
sprouting out um and uh we have a lot of

243
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:17,479
this High Bush

244
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,480
blueberry uh so the season has come and

245
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,159
gone but it has little

246
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,959
tiny uh blueberries that were

247
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:30,000
tasty uh so that's high Bush blueberry

248
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,479
High Bush blueberry

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,919
um and so we've

250
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,680
[Music]

251
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,639
planted these have big bulbous

252
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,559
blueberries uh so in two years that'll

253
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,240
grow

254
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:48,239
up

255
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:53,360

you can't cut down the tree like the

303
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,958
rose goes like way up high into the

304
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,000
trees so before cutting down the trees

305
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,799

352
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:50,038
naked through the

353
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:53,200
vines see what Happ the amount of well

354
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:56,319

359
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,679
uh oh yeah and then the Japanese

360
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,159
Barberry we have a ton of that and that

361
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:16,798
is like Ground Zero for ticks because

362
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:19,679
it's a prickly bushy plant and ticks go

363
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,879
from the deer to little rodents like

364
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,919
mice yeah and then the mice hide in the

365
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,080
Japanese Barberry cuz it's like safe

366
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,640
from predators there and then the tick

367
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,158
climb up and wait for the deer to come

368
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,159
by oh no wait for people that come

369
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,159

372
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,158
woods okay now we're going in the shade

373
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,240
okay so we cut down a bunch of trees

374
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,480
here and we'll kind of clear out the

375
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,240
ground because we'll line some uh some

376
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,038
tree crops up on that side so a few more

377
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,000
of these trees are coming

378
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:15,038
down um but I'm waiting for the foliage

379
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,720
to to leave

380
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,789
us

381
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,159
um but in the

382
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,359
[Music]

383
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:26,200
meantime

384
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:30,719
uh we planted be root

385
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,720
raspberry that are coming in

386
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,760
and what's funny with the be root

387
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,200
raspberry if you

388
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:41,679
come so they're coming in and with the

389
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,600
mulch for each one we have we have our

390
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,360
garden garden vegetables like almost

391
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,119
each that happens in my yard all the

392
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:52,199
time like there's

393
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:54,239
one here's one but all of this stuff is

394
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,960
invasive this is the multifloral Rose so

395
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,720
we got to come through and uh I have

396
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,960
something to yank this stuff out it just

397
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,480
takes forever or bring in little push

398
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,880
tiller to kind of go around because I

399
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,079
want to kind of be beat out the root

400
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,120
system what's our uh so we have perm

401
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:18,119
strategy up here

402
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:19,558
uh we'll do something um J go stand in

403
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,719
the shade right there you'll be much

404
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,038
cooler we're going to go in the woods

405
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,038
it's going to be much easier for you uh

406
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:30,319
no they're not I built I did some Trails

407
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:33,558
uh you some of these are getting nice

408
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:36,279
and big these are raspberry too that's

409
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:38,798
raspberry raspberry there's about 20 of

410
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,359
them on that side and that

411
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:44,119
side

412
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,119
um and

413
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,640
uh little mushrooms those are

414
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:05,319
mushrooms what are the weird uh uh worms

415
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:07,558
called the invasive ones uh I forget

416
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,918
they're real name but it's like a

417
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,240
jumping worm so they're like twice as

418
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,679
thick and about twice as long as your

419
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,798
regular earthworms and when you touch

420
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,038
them like a regular earthor be like o

421
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,599
get away from me and these ones like

422
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,599
spring up and like land some places I

423
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,240
haven't seen as many this year as I saw

424
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,079
last year yeah last year I feel like

425
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,519
they like owned right

426
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:38,119
but uh High Bush blueberry and then so

427
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:40,918
I've been doing Trails through here yeah

428
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:45,399
um and

429
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:51,120
uh we'll we'll do a lot of under

430
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:53,320
story uh stuff here in the woods um but

431
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,399
one of the things that's pretty

432
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:58,918
interesting I find interesting is and

433
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,440
I'll show it to you when we get there is

434
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:06,640
we have a lot of what's called Hillside

435
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,440
blueberry which um will start to fruit

436
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,960
if you give it a little bit of sun not

437
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,360
so much sun I think the canopy is too

438
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,720
thick so we'll take out some trees and

439
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:22,918
get some sun down onto

440
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:26,679
it um all the stone walls here

441
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:30,640
are back in the 19th century through the

442
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:34,798
early 20th century it was livestock farm

443
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,200
so these were the holding pens for them

444
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,000
Michael alpaca would be very happy in

445
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,640
here yes well this is the first one I'm

446
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,400
going to work on and turn it into like

447
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,480
basically uh it'll be

448
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,000
like eventually we'll do like a dining

449
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,038
room here so it's like you come up and

450
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,119
you have your you're eating in the woods

451
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,519
and yeah and stuff um but

452
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,798
basically kind of thoughtfully plant

453
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,038
around

454
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:08,200
it both kind

455
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:08,200
of Woodland ornamentals and food

456
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,360
crop whatever grows in the

457
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:17,519
shade such as your what was your shade

458
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,879
tobacco yes the Connecticut shade

459
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,359
tobacco right I think would enjoy being

460
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,480
grown in Connecticut in the shade in the

461
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:28,839
shade and we have plenty of shade

462
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,240
partial sun look at that

463
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:35,359
so anyway this what we're walking on all

464
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:38,679
was like that right there uh and so I've

465
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:41,479
made uh started started doing a trail

466
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,759
system through here you should do a tree

467
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,759
house for the girls we want to do a tree

468
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:50,240
house and zipline yeah zipline from cuz

469
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:53,839
we have a couple of really nice rockout

470
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,240
croppings that are up on a hill all the

471
00:23:53,839 --> 00:24:00,359
way down to drop into the

472
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,558
pond right for bath time right uh

473
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:05,558
exactly

474
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,558
exactly

475
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,960
um

476
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,759
swings we can do some

477
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,679
swings uh the tent actually is going to

478
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:20,400
go way back here we need to build a

479
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:24,399
platform for it the the one that was

480
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,159
just in the one that Gemma was just

481
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:29,199
in there's so much time

482
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,919
sh uh

483
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,919
um I suggested

484
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,080
Sneakers but

485
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,960
um there are lots of little micro

486
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,679
climates here so this was a oak

487
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,278
Hickory

488
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,038
uh Woods uh and this is technically an

489
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,798
oak Hickory Savanah

490
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:03,919
um which I think is a funny name because

491
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:07,440
when I think of Savannah I think of

492
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,440
giant African PLS or

493
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:18,480
something but the

494
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,439
um we're walking up through the middle

495
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,440
of the

496
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,440
property

497
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,319
and this watch where you're even though

498
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,359
it's cleared you still got to watch

499
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:31,519
where you're Uncle Michael's wearing on

500
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,519
his

501
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:42,359
feet but anyway so this stuff that you

502
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:44,759
see here this is Hillside

503
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,639
blueberry and you'll see like I mean

504
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,398
it's kind of late but you'll see a

505
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,240
couple of little

506
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:56,759
blueberries but um supposedly if and we

507
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,599
have a ton of it uh and supposedly if

508
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:03,200
you get at least a little bit of some on

509
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:07,879
it they start to fruit and um and it's

510
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,600
kind of do it in uh is it like oak trees

511
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,840
kind of go Bonkers with their acorns

512
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:16,839
every two or three years to overwhelm

513
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:20,158
the wild life kind of just defeat with

514
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:24,359
numbers so uh maybe we'll make a

515
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,360
hillside blueberry jam

516
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,520
so main Orchard is generally going to be

517
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:39,398
where we're going to walk down to it

518
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,398
it's going to be down

519
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,440
there

520
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,798
what it's it's so it's this bark see on

521
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,798
the ground there Gemma see how there's

522
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:58,440
that Brown Strip there was probably a

523
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:59,440
log there that I moved when I was making

524
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,840
this

525
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:07,600
path okay well you know what we'll get

526
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:09,398
some some uh alcohol to dry it out CS

527
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,759
right that's that's it's probably from

528
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:13,798
the ocean you don't put alcohol yeah yes

529
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,200
you do

530
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,918
Gemma that's exactly what we did with

531
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,880
valentina's ears when she was

532
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,759
complaining that her ears hurt it dries

533
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,278
out the water that's in your

534
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:28,919
ear alcohol so was a rubbing alcohol not

535
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:31,919
a drinking alcohol uh so this is the

536
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,759
blueberry the hillside

537
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,480
blueberry so this stuff's getting

538
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:39,679
light yeah like there are some patches I

539
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,079
mean obviously there's just so much

540
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,320
there's a tree blight on uh beach trees

541
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,918
um not all of these are beach but

542
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,278
there's a bunch of blight in the

543
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,960
Northeast that's like you see so much

544
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:54,679
dead stuff uh and so it's just kind of

545
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,159
over the years thin out all the stuff

546
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,840
that's dead take out some of the bigger

547
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,159
trees let some of the small ER ones grow

548
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,918
up it'll start bringing some light down

549
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:09,679
um onto the ground here

550
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:12,200
uh but the trail system was sort of to

551
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:16,320
help me see what's back

552
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,319
here and to walk around in

553
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,839
it but Gemma here's some good spots for

554
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,519
a zip

555
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:27,519
line yeah look at that

556
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,919
oh and bunge

557
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:38,079
jumping we don't quite have bungee

558
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,159
jumping but

559
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:44,278
uh but we do have some perches that you

560
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:47,360
could do some zip lines

561
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:50,159
on here we'll go over to that one over

562

592
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,159
what do you think of a if you had a zip

593
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:36,480
line from here would this work Gemma

594
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,679
down we should build stairs I feel

595
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,839
like we'll make a for the city girls

596
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,080
right have a little escalator solar

597
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:48,599
powered escalator for just bring you up

598
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:52,278
but if we did a zip line down that

599
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:54,119
way um build like a tree house we could

600
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:56,679
do a tree house if you come and help

601
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:58,678
build it we can do all sorts of stuff we

602
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,399
want to do some platform if you want to

603
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,840
do a play in the woods make a little

604
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:06,319
stage out here you guys what would

605
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:09,398
happen if it stopped in the middle if

606
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,759
zip line oh the zip line well well uh

607
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:14,518
you kind of have to move yourself along

608
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:17,079
or jump down jump

609
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,759
down over there is a big stand of

610
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,558
mountain laurel uh which is pretty when

611
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:25,158
it

612
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:26,678
blooms my ear touches it it hurts I know

613
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,000
so we're going to get you some stuff at

614
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,720
CVS to help

615
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
okay I know it might be some wax as well

616
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:38,079
no it it's probably water uh from the

617
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,200
ocean uh so we'll go down this way and

618
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:43,599
then I'll show you where we're going to

619
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,399
do the the orchard okay so follow Uncle

620
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,240
Mikey Gemma I'm in flipflops so then

621
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,839
ultimately a house you'd want to put

622
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,079
where somewhere up over in that

623
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,759
direction and how much further back does

624
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:59,678
the property go we're kind of dead

625
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,798
center of it so probably like like four

626
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,038
or five acres in that direction and four

627
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:07,000
or five acres in the other

628
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:11,119
direction um

629
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,159
so 8 800 yards thousand yards I don't

630
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:17,678
know

631
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:20,120
um uh okay and then it's maybe another

632
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,399
four 300 yards that way to the end of

633
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:25,918
the

634
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:30,798
property after the mountain laurel is um

635
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:34,639
is uh the St wall and then on the other

636
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:36,519
side of the property uh Federal fish and

637
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:38,519
wildlife bought that because they're

638
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,079
doing a study on flora and fauna in

639
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,919
coastal regions I feel you should be

640
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:45,199
like a huge trampoline here so if you

641
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,720
fall you

642
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,038
just what if you jump off the rock down

643
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,038
to a trampoline no no

644
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,519
okay don't you think that's a good

645
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:58,798
idea well you could do a net like a

646
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:00,839
circus net right

647
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,558
yeah come this way I'll hold your hand

648
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:05,759
as you step down

649
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:05,759
yeah or

650
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,200
trampol step step

651
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,919
step

652
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,240
[Music]

Marco Polo

668
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,039
Marco that's how we find each other in

669
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,599
here we also have little walkie-talkies

670
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:52,000
which are fun to

671
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,760
use okay Uncle Michael's going to show

672
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,519

673
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,520
this do you have a good cap

674
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,280
yeah haven't done this in

675
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,039
years

676
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,719
close we'll have to prac get back all

677
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:27,960
right Jim you're going to master that's

678
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,799
I used to do that when I was your age

679
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,838
that's probably one of the last times I

680
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,400
did it so if you look here there's a

681
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:38,838
stone wall that shoots down that way

682
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,358
comes across here and then on that side

683
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:45,920
and so this is

684
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:50,519
the first area of future Orchard so this

685
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:54,599
area right here this area here okay um

686
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:57,000
and uh you know it's going to be it's a

687
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,599
woodland Orchard it's not going to be

688
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,639
kind of like like we have a big open

689
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,800
field and start planting trees but we'll

690
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:09,279
take down a ton of this leave some of

691
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,160
the existing trees and then also you

692
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,760
know we're in Connecticut in the woods

693
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:18,239
we have lots of lots of rocks so sort of

694
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,800
plant your stuff all through here um

695
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,479
where it can but maybe the Rocks provide

696
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:28,480
nice minerals mineral

697
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:31,519
treats uh but it'll be um

698
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,719
uh a lot of peach probably and a lot of

699
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:39,159
Quints uh is probably the the two main

700
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:40,799
things and uh then I've also

701
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:45,519
[Music]

702
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,800
um uh uh some guy that I follow on

703
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:51,400
social

704
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:54,800
media uh sent me a bunch of pmen seeds

705
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:58,599
yeah that I've started and they're like

706
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:02,280
this big uh right now and and uh then

707
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:05,119
I've also started from last year's um

708
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,920
peach jam batch it was these Jersey

709
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,119
peaches that's a feather that's a

710
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,838
feather these Jersey peaches and I've

711
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,920
started those and that type of thing is

712
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:18,000
uh there's this guy Mark Shepard who

713
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,480
talks about the stun method which is

714
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,400
sheer total utter neglect and so I'm

715
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,960
growing those and I will just stick them

716
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,160
in the wood somewhere give them kind of

717
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,400
a happy home and just like see if see if

718
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,399
they grow

719
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,200
um and how they do but I'll let I'll do

720
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,880
that when they're like two years old

721
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:41,000
give them a Fighting Chance uh but this

722
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:44,400
will be cultivated here um our big issue

723
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,119
is figuring out how to get uh some

724
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,920
larger machines in here because that

725
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,838
pond has a brook that runs across the

726
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,079
front of the property and you can't and

727
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:58,719
we only have a foot path to get over the

728
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:01,039
brook um so we have to either build a

729
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,799
bridge or well didn't I send you those

730
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:07,719
like pontoon Bridge uh well we had this

731
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,720
one guy come and uh he's like I could

732
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:15,118
clear this in a week um he's like the is

733
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:18,399
because we would keep all the the uh

734
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,838
chipped trees and stuff um and just use

735
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,160
the wood

736
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:28,880
the we would just use the the wood

737
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:30,039
clippings um and uh but his machine

738
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,000
which is one of those giant things that

739
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,920
like comes down the tree and just like

740
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,400
grinds it down like cuts it like flesh

741
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,440
with the Earth is I think he said it was

742
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,639
70

743
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:45,800
tons so we are going to petition the

744
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:47,679
fish and wildli if we can get a access

745
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,599
from their side and coming through the

746
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:53,318
back

747
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,240
um so is there a road uh there's a

748
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:58,358
little Access Road uh but we would then

749
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:03,399
have to kind of cut down

750
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:04,719
down 25 yards of trees like this um on

751
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,079
the fish and wildlife property on the

752
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,399
fish and wildlife side to come on in or

00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,280
like 20 yards

754
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,599

this early 20th century like 1920s

793

00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:30,800
you're letting your cow and sheep grze

797

00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,358
doing it comes out in the fall um so

827
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,639
actually we need to give it a good

828
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:57,519
weeding uh and give it space to come

829
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:58,920
out um

830
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:02,079
so where those

831
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,000
little which one's the saffron you can't

832
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,680
see it it dies back and then it emerges

833
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,159
in the fall but basically where you see

834
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:12,239
the pink uh little staks uh that's the

835
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:14,558
row there are three or four rows and

836
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:17,598
we're just doing a test to see how it

837
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,880
grows um and if it grows well we'll

838
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:24,119
plant more

839
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:27,519
saffron you got to scratch yeah and down

840
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:31,318
here Gemma is where the chicken coup

841
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:35,759
will go right down here right down in

842
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,759
there follow him cleaning out

843
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,799
space so I have chicken coupe with

844
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,640
little chickens and you'll be eating the

845
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,079
chicken eggs when you visit next year

846
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,558
and the chicken shortly after that

847
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:54,000
uh no we're going to have you should let

848
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:55,920
CH EG chick huh you should let the

849
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,719
chickens get first well we're going to

850
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,358
probably get little chicks

851
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:03,519
how do chicken eggs give birth well the

852
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:07,318
eggs hatch and turn into chickens and

853
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:10,800
then they give birth to uh you get your

854
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:10,800
rooster and then

855
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:19,239
um so more Blueberry Blueberry Blueberry

856
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,239

there

858
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:32,359
uh and then there's all that

859
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:34,599
side uh like that way yeah on the other

860
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:38,000
side of that stone wall which I haven't

861
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:41,318
even barely even touched this year Jemma

862

864
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:46,199
job you want to go inside and take down

865
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:49,799

tent no I want to go inside the house

867
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,680
yeah inside the house that's where we're

868
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,920
going

869
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,318
uh here

870
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,800
smell this one Crush that and smell it

871
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:05,960

872
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,280
mint can I eat it if you

873
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:12,240
want and then this one is a different

874
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:14,480
type of mint oh and this

875
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,399
one smell this

876
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,079
one yep that one's from there yeah this

877
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,440
is more like a spearmint yeah one's a

878
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,760
spearmint one's a this one smells so

879
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,358
good and then one right I don't know

880
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,640
which one I forget which one is which

881
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:32,960
that one's a good one too that one's

882
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,960
like a spearm this last one

883
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:42,279
yeah so it's also like sure those roots

884
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,559
don't start we're also G to like you

885
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,760
know it's like plant rhubarb in places

886
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,720
and echon in places so there's a lot of

887
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,000
foraging opportunity like you might not

888
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,639
need it every season or every year but

889
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
you know where you can go find it when

890
00:46:53,639 --> 00:47:01,159
you need it right

891
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:05,000
all right so burms and uh water what's

892
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:08,480
your vision for water uh when it rain

893
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,800
water is bring up here to holding tanks

894
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,119
and then feed it that way as well as no

895
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:18,200
no I'm saying when it rains to try to oh

896
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:23,760
uh okay so we have mad flooding uh

897
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:27,039
issues here I've witnessed it and uh uh

898
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:31,760
which is either the soil is so compacted

899
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:33,199
or the Bedrock is only like an a limited

900
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,480
amount of space

901
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:39,039
underneath uh but we will do um that

902
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,119
side is worse because there's a giant

903
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:46,880
rock face over there and it just comes

904
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:50,039
down and we're going to do um uh bur and

905
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,880
swes over there uh but then kind of just

906
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:54,519
an initial one just and then as we start

907
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,480
kneading water kind of Branch Branch

908
00:47:54,519 --> 00:48:01,800
things out um

909
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:04,679
water comes down here not as bad but

910
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,440
this could end up being some sort of

911
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:11,039
like holding

912
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:14,400
Pond um but I would like to see if I

913
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:18,159
could do um

914
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:22,318
uh grapes uh they're not mutually

915
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:27,118
exclusive um smells

916
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:27,119
good we do a rice Patty

917
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,240
but yeah it comes down yeah were you

918
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:36,480
yeah you were here when this was just

919
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:38,679
all mud oh yeah uh and um this well also

920
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,480
when the water was just like going right

921
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:44,199
over the uh yeah this this spring like

922
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,599
in March like the average March rain

923
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:50,519
around here is 3 in and we had something

924
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:54,599
like 14 in so the water was all up in

925
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:56,480
here right um I remember it's coming

926
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:58,119
down that way and then the pond itself

927
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,119
is

928
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:01,119
overflowing

929
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:07,160
uh so basically this is what you would

930
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:11,040
need to get heavy equipment over yeah

931
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:13,838
but it but it goes down this way PR yeah

932
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:16,159
it goes down this way so I think if we

933
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:19,558
did do some sort of what like pontoon

934
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:22,279
Bridge it would be down over there right

935
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,760
um and then that's a matter of talking

936
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,280
with

937
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,480
uh with folk about doing you don't think

938
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,200
you could get just like a regular Kabota

939
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,960
tractor over this I can do like a small

940
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:37,078
little excavator so I'm going to get a

941
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,760
little small excavator but like a like

942
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:41,839
the kaboto we had growing up like you

943
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,680
could get one of those over this yeah

944
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:46,719
okay uh but I'm talking back where we

945
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:49,000
want to do the orchard where it's just

946
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:51,519
like if you had like a big excavator

947
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,679
yeah a catle yeah like one it's not wide

948
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:56,239
enough to come over but can't you like

949
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,679
put fish in here there are fish in here

950
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,159
and turt

951
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,118
what there's Turtles there's Turtles

952
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:05,159
last year I saw a big giant turtle

953
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:06,880
they're Ducks we had a family of geese

954

goslings um there still fish in here the

957
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:17,798
the ducks live somewhere right in here

958
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,358
occasionally see them pop out well

959
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:22,480
they're not in the Stream they're over

960
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:25,759
here if you come in the pond if you come

961
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,039
to the pond side and then you might see

962
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,720
our we have a great blue heron that

963
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:36,759

little bridge over there you'll see some

973

fish poking around every so

974
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,798
often this was a

found I found this uh uh this spring and

981
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:30,719
this area floods in the found it where

982
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
like you bought it yeah at a local it

983
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:38,000
wasn't just wildly growing I was at a

984
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,719
um uh I was at a native Nur or I was at

985
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,280
a nursery not a native nursery and I saw

986
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:44,118
it it's from Japan and I was like that

987
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,798
looks like a banana so it's a hearty

988
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:50,519
banana if we're in zone six rapidly

989
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:52,880
turning into zone seven and if you were

990
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:55,599
in zone8 you would actually get little

991
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,680
bananas on it um unless you put it in a

992
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,318
greenhouse right but I have it in the

993
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:03,358
ground and basically each uh fall you

994
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:06,039
cut it down to about here and let it

995
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:08,039
just go uh goes dormant in the winter

996
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:12,039
and then pops back up so I put in two

997
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:15,119
one here one there

998
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:18,880
um and then this is funny so this

999
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:23,680
Tomatoes yeah yep so this was a willow

1000
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:25,760
that probably fell 30 years ago or so

1001
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,798
and when I was clearing out this area I

1002
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,079
chopped a bunch of branches from it that

1003
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:33,599
were coming off here

1004
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:36,960
and this Willow is still

1005
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:39,280
growing like there's some root somewhere

1006
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,199
with some little vein that comes through

1007
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,000
but this is the

1008
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:47,639
willow um which is kind of

1009
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,599
neat you don't go in that side you go in

1010
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:54,558
over there that got sealed off God

1011
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,559
there's so many of these

1012
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,000
uh the spotted Lantern fly it hasn't

1013
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,240
made it up here yet but uh I've been

1014
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:11,358
following it's in like Fairfield County

1015
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:14,639
down towards New York yeah um and uh at

1016
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:16,480
Ned's house in Brooklyn last summer you

1017
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,838
saw they were all over the place really

1018
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:24,119
oh yeah in New York City um so they're

1019
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:24,119
slowly making their Way North

1020
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:36,318
these guys are funky they're cool it's a

1021
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,798
dragon Lily um but it has its like

1022
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:40,798
little

1023
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,798
thing

1024
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:50,039
there oh this is so I have a couple of

1025
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:53,519
these at uh at

1026
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:57,199
home this was the false

1027
00:53:53,519 --> 00:54:03,199
Indigo if you want these pods like you

1028
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:03,199
take them off in um in uh like the

1029
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:10,000
fall but it's a very pretty uh

1030
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:12,798
ornamental so I mean what I was thinking

1031
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,079
is like if you

1032
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:19,318
had a dump truck of spent

1033
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:23,160
barley I mean theoretically they we

1034
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:25,119
could like just let it go back that way

1035
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:28,279
well one of the things I was thinking so

1036
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:31,200
the big issue for having a vents here is

1037
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:36,119
limited parking right and so we have 3

1038
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:39,399
acres over here right so

1039
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:43,318
um what I was thinking of

1040
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,318
doing is

1041
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:51,119
uh just

1042
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:55,159
like taking out the wall grading it down

1043
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,160
and then um

1044
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:07,639
oh

1045
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:11,558
Jesus and then there's a there's a

1046
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:14,078
stream back there but basically having

1047
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:19,599
this area here where when you need it

1048
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:22,000
you could park 30 or 40 cars um and

1049
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,039
uh

1050
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,920
um basically handle but what I'm saying

1051
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:32,240
is if if oh and so then you could also

1052
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:36,358
just dump your your stuff there uh

1053
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:38,639
the I think uh there's a there's a

1054
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:41,279
Spirits company and a beer company that

1055
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:45,759
would both kind of said yeah we want a

1056
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,559
whaler Brewing keeps calling me asking

1057
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,760
they're like do you want to come Friday

1058
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:53,039
with a dump truck uh so I like I would

1059
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,880
do it it's just I just don't feel like

1060
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:56,799
having a giant pile here where I'm like

1061
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,599
with a little tiny wheelar

1062
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:01,400
but you could leave it there's rush I

1063
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,400
don't want to have a big pile of I mean

1064
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,440
it starts

1065
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,720
to I mean you can turn it so it's not

1066
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:11,358
doesn't get

1067
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:14,959
stinky uh but it's like this is the

1068
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:17,838
front of a beautiful house um we put in

1069
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:21,880
some blueberry and blackberry here some

1070
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:25,078
sage and they're just letting like this

1071
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:26,880
here was basically look like that

1072
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:29,920
there um

1073
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:34,480
um which some of that is little native

1074
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:39,240
flowers other of it is uh the multiflor

1075
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:41,440
rose so this is the multiflor Rose

1076
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:44,318
hanging over does it have Vine I mean uh

1077
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,358
prickers yeah yeah it's a pain in the

1078
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:50,558
ass to deal with how you doing how are

1079
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:54,239
you doing well thank you how you doing

1080
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,240
um but

1081
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,640
uh yeah so anyway what I'd love I mean

1082
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,798
I'd love to do it if it could just be a

1083
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:04,279
little bit further but if I had like

1084
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:06,239
there's four of us ready to move it

1085
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,480
around the property it's like dump it

1086
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:09,879
here and we can just well that's why I

1087
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:13,240
was thinking if the truck backed up here

1088
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,760
put it and just dumped it in there yeah

1089
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:17,038
you can leave it over the winter and

1090
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,760
just let it do its thing yeah yeah and

1091
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,760
that's one load and then you can see

1092
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,640
yeah are there any issues could I take

1093
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,680
another load right but it's like there's

1094
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:30,038
no downside to having

1095
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:33,118
yeah back back one load of of

1096
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:34,839

1099
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,960
composting um so that's also where it be

1100
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:44,599
awesome where it's like yeah I can get

1101
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:48,039
just a big truck to drive over there and

1102
