14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:39,000
years old full of vegetables cannabis

15
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:40,558
defoliation M grass leaves imo3 bokashi

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,600
all kinds of inputs I might want to put

17
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,439
in there loaded with stuff and I'll show

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,480
you how much jlf I use when I water my

19
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:48,439
plants and then in the back back I've

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,558
got a trash can full I got two trash can

21
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:53,079
fulls actually but one's back there it's

22
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,558
bokashi that's been fermenting for four

23
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,399
months four months I've never Bashi that

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,198
long so we'll see what it looks like

25
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,558
okay first up is all the new compost

26
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:01,759
right here

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,158
you look in the light you can probably

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,239
see the bugs flying all around it little

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,159
fungus knat looking things flies soon

30
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,719
there will be lots of black soldierly

31
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,359
larvae and they will start to devour all

32
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,560
this but this is new compost that I've

33
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:19,079
started these bins in about November

34
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,040
this little visual here shows you how

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,000
many 5 gallon buckets it takes to make

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,640
one bucket of compost 8 to 10 I'd say

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,319
about 10 usually it's kind of a lot of

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,879
it's a lot of material to make a little

39
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,118
bit of comp so remember that but if you

40
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:36,920
but if you have a 5G bucket full of

41
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:39,200
compost that is very valuable to a to a

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,359
organic grower but you can see lots of

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,280
fruits flowers you can see where I've

44
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:47,078
put my Bashi down it helps with smells

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,879
I'm going to put more Bashi down on here

46
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:53,639
taco shells eggs spent mushroom bags

47
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,078
root balls just tons of stuff whatever

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,680
came from our table goes right into here

49
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,839
all right here is the compost that is

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,799
ready and and it is gorgeous stuff's

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,159
probably 9 to 10 months old or so it's

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,239
been breaking down for a long time

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,480
there's red wiggler right

54
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:18,800
there little cold but just look how dark

55
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,799
it is how grainy it is it's light and

56
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:25,199
fluffy it's been decomposed by red

57
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,360
wigglers and black soldier fly

58
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,280
larvae again you can see the red

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,440
wigglers right there they're all all

60
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,439
down in there

61
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,840
more they actually come when it's colder

62
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,318
red wigglers like it when it's colder

63
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,439
the black soldier flies like it when

64
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,079
it's like it when it's

65
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:50,199
hotter you can see them all in

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,440
there but that is what I use to make a

67
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:54,799
good im4 with right

68
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,519
there all right let's look at the jlf

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,959
all right here comes the jlf this is the

70
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,319
jlf that I use to water all of my indoor

71
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,959
plants

72
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,719
I don't switch up my jlf I've used it

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,158
from the very beginning of growing

74
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,878
indoors back around October so I'll take

75
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,598
this long stick right here just Mash a

76
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,719
hole right in the middle and then take

77
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,000
my cup and dip it out of that little

78
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,759
well um check it all the black soldier

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,280
flies along this lid they want to get in

80
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,878
so

81
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,799
bad but this this one I have not messed

82
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:32,399
with at all totally full it froze and

83
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,560
blew the lid off spewed out a little bit

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,840
but it's 2 years old just sitting there

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,759
you can see lots of vegetables corn in

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,959
there but now to a 5 gallon

87
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:46,438
bucket this is what I use to feed my

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,438
plants there one

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,640

91
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,039
plans Bashi next all right next up is

92
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,879

93
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:02,560
4 months I have a bigger trash can full

94
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,959
haven't looked at either one of them

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,640
haven't used it at all I've never

96
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,438
fermented for 4 months it was simply an

97
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,438
experiment that I started this back in

98
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,639
just the end of October so I've got

99

00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,359
more all right here we go a little

114
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,600
better

115
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,560
shot so often when you boi you might see

116
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,560
stuff like this there's some mold on the

117
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,560
top right there that means some air got

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
in there that's all

119
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,879
that nice white bacteria nothing wrong

120
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,120
with that and there's nothing wrong with

121
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,719
that little bit of mold right there but

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,959
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use

123
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,400
the top layers right here for the

124
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:19,318
compost scrape off the top where

125
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,519
probably the air came in contact with it

126
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,800
and it just creates a little bit of mold

127
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,959
little bit of

128
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,879
bacteria whatever it might be but it's

129
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,680
got a good strong ferment smell I don't

130
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,639
think there's anything wrong with it I'm

131
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,959
going to get it out here I'm going to

132
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,079
dry it on those tables but I'm going to

133
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,279
mix this

134
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:46,918
Bashi with some of this nice Acorn

135
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:49,638
imo3 and I'm going to use this on the

136
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,079
compost here we go all right I'm going

137
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:55,360
to dump the Bashi

138
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,359
Out start

139
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,478
drying

140
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:13,719
smells nice smells like vinegary bread

141
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,720
man smells

142
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,399
good

143
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,799
yeah it smells really

144
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,400
good I just need to get it out I'll keep

145
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,120
I'll keep raking it for a couple days

146
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,799
it's going to be nice and warm will dry

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,598
out well fan on it out all righty

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,520
there's the bokashi all laid out

149
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:52,240
hopefully it'll dry the next five or 6

150
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,198
days out here I'll probably put a fan on

151
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,598
it and keep it in the Sun so I've got

152
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,160
the beautiful Bashi wet Bashi and acorn

153

00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,918
bubbles

166
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,000

compost right bringing the IMO 3 and wet

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120

169
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,360
[Music]

170
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,720
compost we're going to just give it a

171
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,280
little

172
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,879
covering you can test your Bashi put it

173
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,758
on some organic

174
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,520

175

smell keeps the pests away a little bit

179
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,918
but definitely helps with the smell

180
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,199
helps break down all the organic matter

181
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,198
