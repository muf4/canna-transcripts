[Music]

4
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:33,659
we have another session everybody showed

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,579
up early oh we're live we're doing this

6
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,500
hi everyone

7
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,640
um yeah no we have a great sesh today we

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,439
have some cookies we have some

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,439
sovereignties we have some really good

10
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:47,339
hats so let's talk sovereignty with our

11
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,959
uh sovereignty glass expert

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,260
thank you for bringing the really sweet

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,539
glass through of course of course

14
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:58,738
um I got a mini three Dome here so it's

15
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,679
a 44 to 50 to 44. uh and then I got the

16
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,479
44. it's a downgrade stem they're both

17
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,438
partials

18
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,060
um and then I got the cold work fa

19
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,579
I could take a rip out of right now

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,900
because I already have a bowl pack so if

21
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,759
somebody wants to hold this for a second

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,760
yeah yeah let's get it and talk

23
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:30,478
so I think that this uh this downgrade

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,478
stem what's good this downgrade stem 44

25
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,219
it's a ghost over ghost accent it's like

26
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,500
you said it's a partial accident you got

27
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:41,219
a nice booty color right there some some

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,420
Bridge color some some nice ice pinch

29
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,978
color

30
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,240
ripping the full accent Bowl

31
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:50,640
yeah he's got a nice Sovereign scene

32
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,519
lighter with some sandblasting nice

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,618
etching on on the sides

34
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,959
oh yeah fatty bowls and they're

35
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,180
relatively local right the pricing on

36
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,859
the song local sorry oh local yeah no

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,540
they're out of uh Riverside I believe is

38
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,560
where they blow all the glass hell yeah

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,500
yeah but they've started super small and

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,680
became really big there's a really cult

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,840
following for them people prefer to rip

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,500
those bongs over anything else well I've

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,300
always heard that for function so yeah

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,520
they're not necessarily per se for like

45
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,379
the looks of it yeah like the looks are

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,180
just a give or take it depends on if you

47
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,579
like the glass or not but they're about

48
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,560
the scientific function of the perks and

49
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,280
how they actually work not just like how

50
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,280
it looks you know

51
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,719
but I always feel like my issue has just

52
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,539
been that like sometimes they're too

53
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,159
much of a rocket launcher for me oh 100

54
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:46,019
well that's why that's why there's so

55
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,878
many different perks because they all

56
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,200
have a different effect and there's

57
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,679
going to be one that's going to be good

58
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,018
for you you know hell yeah so it I

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,360
personally like the 44s because they rip

60
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,400
super fat and then some people like

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,220
these the um

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,900
it's I think mini three to dome the

63
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,419
domes are really smooth because you get

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,939
that extra percolation of the smoke

65
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,439
and it also keeps it really clean like

66
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:14,039
you see how up here there's not much

67
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,680
dirty water compared to down here

68
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,598
so it's super fire

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,060
it's super expensive is that that is the

70
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,119
function of the middle zone is to have

71
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,920
like a wider perk I guess yeah kind of

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,780
there's a there's different sets so

73
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,878
there's like even tree cyclers that it's

74
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,919
a full it's it's the same width it's a

75
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,799
44 the whole way up but it has three

76
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,500
perks so it's just more diffusion you

77
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,700
know yeah yeah hell yeah

78
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,699
yeah all perked up

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,539
so do you want

80
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,219
anything yeah no so I'm hash right we do

81
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,979
a lot of solventless extracts we're from

82
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,840
the San Fernando Valley this is our

83
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,878
brand right here oh yeah we got tons of

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,560
Terps for you guys if you want to dab up

85
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,018
on some stuff we got some new strains

86
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,598
would love for you guys to try it out is

87
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,180
that flower that you grew as well yeah

88
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,919
older older batch but yeah about your

89
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,939
medium and how you like to grow the

90
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,939
medium how we like to grow

91
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:15,899
so we we grow we started growing mostly

92
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,160
out of rockwool and I like I like saying

93
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,720
like talking to people about it because

94
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,180
I feel like a lot of people are like oh

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,880
I only like living soil I like you can

96
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,860
get a very clean turkey exactly and you

97
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,899
can drive the plant harder and you can

98
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,240
do a lot and the resin production

99
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,579
creates exactly so when you're washing

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,800
control over that and you're getting a

101
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:37,379
more full expression exactly that Medium

102
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,879
which is cool same thing with so then

103
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,219
another thing that people don't like

104
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,079
with me saying is that we use salts and

105
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,940
everyone says that you lack Terps when

106
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,459
you use salts but I honestly don't see a

107
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,379
lack of anything well and you're mostly

108
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,418
if I remember the genetics I've seen

109
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,939
correctly running with stuff that was

110
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:55,019
bred under Hydro conditions oh yeah in a

111
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,600
lot of places and so it's also like a

112
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:00,839
lot of genetics were steered towards

113
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,840
thriving with those oh yeah 100 percent

114
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,519
exactly it's the high yielding High

115
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,758
resinous strains you know the really

116
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,959
good bag appeal dense buds like and so

117
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,879
what are some of the Staples in your

118
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,198
garden sorry what are some of the

119
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,240
Staples in your garden some of the

120
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,400
Staples uh we're trying to get the cut

121
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,199
back it was our big staple but Peyton's

122
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,739
pie is Gary Payton times Georgia pie

123
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,319
it's a Fino that we hunted from uh a raw

124
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,120
genetics pack uh raw genetics has some

125
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,319
really good stable genetics he's working

126
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,060
with some

127
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,439
not necessarily he's one of those

128
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,478
breeders that's not working with stuff

129
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,000
that he's created himself but it's super

130
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,500
stable high quality strains that are

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,259
from really good breeders and well-known

132
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,180
people so shout out shout out genetics

133
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,520
amazing video Peter I don't know if you

134
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,199
even watched it but with Chad

135
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,198
um yeah he was really good on that yeah

136
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,319
I think you should because he does a lot

137
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,800
of really cool stuff with the Georgia

138
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,099
pie right Georgia pie uh he's doing a

139
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,079
lot of like blue slushy crosses like

140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,720
really cool Z crosses

141
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,879
unique Stuff strawberry Terps we we did

142
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,820
a big veto HUD we did a big feta Hut on

143
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,918
strawberry milk we did the paints pie we

144
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,560
did

145
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,538
a handful of things honestly it was uh

146
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,759
the guala one of our strains it's

147
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:21,779
Scotty's cake it's animal mints times

148
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,699
biscotti times gelato 33 so that's a

149
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:25,739
seed pack from him as well that we Fino

150
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,660
hunted but we've we got a lot of fire

151
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,340
out of there and some of them are

152
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,840
Staples in our garden now and it's

153
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,758
really cool well and I just appreciate

154
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,619
that you're a hashmaker running stuff

155
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,000
indoor and hunting from seed because so

156
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,060
many people I know will only take in

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,879
verified dumpers you know where that cut

158
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,620
is and sometimes

159
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,600
she

160
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,340
tell you

161
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,840
sometimes you have to take those losses

162
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,538
to understand because

163
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,818
you could be missing out on really good

164
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:54,959
Terps that aren't yielding very high you

165
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,120
know like

166
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,620
there's so many Terps but I mean think

167
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,120
about poochie's papaya if someone

168
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,800
skipped over that just because it was a

169
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,379
two percenter we wouldn't have some

170
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,300
crazy candy artificial Terps in the game

171
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,620
I actually didn't know papaya was I

172
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,280
would have assumed papaya was like a six

173
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,079
percent horrible yeah papaya is horrible

174
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,399
papaya Cake's like three percent like

175
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:19,318
it's it's not good no yeah

176
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,418
but it's worth it for the flavor you

177
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,039
know so damn straight people try to push

178
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:25,139
it onto the market and that's why you

179
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,478
don't see much of it or you see the

180
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,400
crosses like the GMO crosses like we

181
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:34,079
have garlic cookies papaya honey banana

182
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,879
papaya anything vigorous right to help

183
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,740
kind of fill out that chirp and it's

184
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,538
like how they're doing all the Z crosses

185
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,579
it's because it's such a weak strain

186
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,680
that everyone's like I love the terp and

187
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,659
they want to bring that serp out but

188
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,220
bring the Vigor of other strains into it

189
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,780
which and Shout Out people like clutcher

190
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,280
who are kind of exactly actually doing

191
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,079
it right yeah things like that and

192
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,559
someone else that I feel like I want to

193
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:58,258
shout out is deep east he's oh yeah he

194
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,478
gets deep into it he's he's not like oh

195
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,759
here's my f1s I'm across it with this

196
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,978
and here's my strain he goes deep into

197
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,919
the genetics deep like

198
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:10,379
I have mad respect for him well in his

199
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,120
on his first smoke of the day

200
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,038
um I feel like he really talked about a

201
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,720
lot of stuff I hear on FCP about you

202
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,839
know the real breeding work is in those

203
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,220
f2s those f3s exactly it's the stuff

204
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,439
that you're unlocking later down the

205
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,120
line that nobody would really see you

206
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,800
know and it makes it harder for people

207
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,000
to replicate your work because instead

208
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,860
of them being able to just take that

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,598
strain and cross it with the same strain

210
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,879
it's a different

211
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,819
further Express genetic of it you know

212
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,139
so it that's that's why I have a lot of

213
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,060
respect for him he takes a lot of time

214
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,979
and so what he does he's not just as

215
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,418
forced as a pollen chucker just someone

216
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,700
that's like oh these are two strings I

217
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:46,379
think would do very well together you

218
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,759
know he puts a lot of thought and time

219
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,559
into it

220
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,600
and then creates with the pollen chokers

221
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,759
are trying to catch up you know like I

222
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,500
think a lot of what Dio has done

223
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,659
people are pulling chucking their way

224
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,100
into right now with the really fruity

225
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:05,639
sherbs 100 minty lavendery yeah the tea

226
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,259
kind of Tasties yeah exactly crazy his

227
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,720
work is awesome do you have any of his

228
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,580
stuff in the garden we used to we lost a

229
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,540
lot of it though we had all the original

230
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:18,600
Z cuts that basically created RS 11 and

231
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:21,059
all the RS phenos we had just got the

232
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,459
permanent marker and we lost it right

233
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:26,000
before we could even grow it it was I

234
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,000
was so sad

235
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:31,199
is that like like a three a light type

236
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,620
situation permanent marker because it's

237
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,620
a Cushman

238
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,100
insane like

239
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,720
bummer on strains like that like light

240
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,820
like you could say like a plant weight

241
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,459
but it all comes down to the grower and

242
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,839
the environment you know because it

243
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,278
plays a huge role you could have a

244
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,040
strain that you're gonna think is going

245
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,139
to stack and be six feet tall and

246
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,299
[ __ ] full of nugs and the person

247
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,439
doesn't know what they're doing and they

248
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,939
don't know how to drive the plant they

249
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,380
don't know how to catch a swell and then

250
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,600
you're just full of a room of popcorn

251
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:02,580
nugs you know so

252
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,320
I think that yes it's a strain that has

253
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,839
the potential to do it but you need to

254
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,700
drive it correctly and that goes back to

255
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,459
not just the medium but the people

256
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,320
behind like you know the care that is

257
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,179
placed in the method and your system

258
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,879
that's exactly that's why I'm kind of

259
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:20,159
like the people that say oh you're not

260
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,919
doing living soil or you're not using uh

261
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,838
you're using salts I'm just like

262
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,579
it doesn't necessarily matter of the

263
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,760
medium or the nutrients you're using

264
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,259
it's how you use it it's

265
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:34,319
interesting in the case of of like

266
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,778
making hash because that somehow I feel

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,260
you're able to get a more pure

268
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:43,379
expression the herb right because the

269
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:46,078
herb is even to some extent like in the

270
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,600
way of the resin whereas and that's what

271
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,120
yeah that's why I respect people who

272
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,459
also grow their flour and wash it

273
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,100
because you get the and start to finish

274
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:58,078
kind of idea of the process and I feel

275
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,240
like as a hashmaker you need that to

276
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,759
really get the full idea of what you're

277
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,500
doing like you're not really

278
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,179
doing things to your full potential

279
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,799
without understanding that start to

280
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:09,000
finish and so is all of your stuff

281
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,799
single Source or do you take in

282
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,700
materials a lot of our stuff is single

283
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,859
Source

284
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,360
um a couple like whenever we're testing

285
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,740
out new strains that we really want to

286
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,360
run

287
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,039
whenever we're testing out new strains

288
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,839
that we really want to run we kind of

289
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,179
source from some people if we need to

290
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,220
but we keep a lot of our stuff in-house

291
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:28,559
we have a handful of really good

292
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,720
cultivators that I I trust with my life

293
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,159
they they just love they have the

294
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,019
passion for growing it's not because

295
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,360
they see it as a cash crop it's because

296
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,360
they they have that love for it you know

297
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:43,980
it is really awesome and so do you have

298
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,779
any requirements of what you'll wash I

299
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,399
mean do you need are there certain

300
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:48,778
requirements that you you know if

301
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,059
something is good if something's gonna

302
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:53,220
hit less than one percent will you touch

303
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,139
it I just washed something from a buddy

304
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,278
of mine that I was testing out straw AC

305
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:01,259
and I got .3 to rosin so and I paid for

306
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,759
it I paid four racks for it bro so it's

307
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,200
like you win and you lose sometimes and

308
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,939
that's part of the game so that's what

309
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,379
where those people fizzle out you burn

310
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,300
out when you don't have that real

311
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,519
passion for it but if you really love it

312
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,439
and like I'm crazy about hash bro so

313
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,879
that's not gonna get in my way I'm Gonna

314
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,260
Keep [ __ ] going and I'm gonna find

315
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,299
what's gonna help me out and what's

316
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,220
gonna do good for me you know

317
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,019
yeah

318
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,519
and keep in mind that point three

319
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,679
percent wasn't even [ __ ] I would smoke

320
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,620
it was so bad it was just all it was all

321
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,359
just stocks and bad stuff yeah bag did

322
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,519
most of the come out of it I pulled it

323
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,500
well I pull all my stuff 90 through 159

324
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,860
and I keep all the other stuff as well

325
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,980
but um even just the 90 head zoos it

326
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,899
wasn't heads it was all stocks and when

327
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,000
and when I pressed it it was just like

328
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,899
didn't have much Terps it was that

329
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,240
greeny kind of like nastiness you know

330
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:53,759
what what stuff that uh maybe doesn't

331
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,039
have high numbers in terms of how well

332
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,819
it washes but that you still run because

333
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:01,980
it's amazing hmm

334
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,019
that's a good question I've ran into

335
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,800
very few of them to be honest I feel

336
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,299
like

337
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,000
um

338
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:11,458
one of the strains that I really enjoy

339
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,899
that doesn't produce enough for us to

340
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,739
make sense to be putting it into

341
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:19,078
production per se is uh the uh

342
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,320
uh Double Cup it's our red pop times

343
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,819
runs that one's around like 3.4 percent

344
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,899
to sift

345
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,879
2.9 terazen a little under that and

346
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,679
it doesn't make much sense to put it

347
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,259
onto Market because you're sitting on so

348
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,259
much valuable product but the terp is

349
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,700
really pronounced that I I like it a lot

350
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,620
it's like one of those

351
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,079
strawberry Terps that it's like an

352
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,659
artificial cough syrup terp that's why

353
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,419
we call it Double Cup but and it's a

354
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:50,699
strawberry Turf yeah it's a red pop red

355
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:53,578
pop times runs so it's straw red pop is

356
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,440
strawberries and cream times uh times

357
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:58,199
strawberry I think

358
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:04,160
so it's it's super super strawberry here

359
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,160
hold on just quickly so you you uh

360
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:16,740
say that again it's yeah it produced

361
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,259
amazing consistency man like I just

362
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,079
rolled up some 305 Hayes from Miami

363
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,399
straight up and come on man like I

364
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,539
couldn't ask for anything better to

365
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,539
preserve that um

366
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,680
the flour mill does a lot of Justice in

367
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,879
terms of preserving the trichomes I feel

368
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,159
like you know one of these cookies

369
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,179
they're called so that's yeah so those

370
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,559
cookies while we roll up some other

371
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,879
stuff and thank you I mean thank you for

372
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,559
sharing so much about your brand of

373
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,600
course no worries I'm here I'm here to

374
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,039
spread the information it's a joke so

375
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,480
this is something that I'm up to with a

376
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,159
couple homies

377
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,860
um we are bringing this to the rec

378
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,000
Market it's a infused cookie mix okay I

379
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,620
don't really want to talk about it I

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,240
just want you guys to eat them no I

381
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,339
would love for you I'd love for you to

382
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,500
talk about it check these things out

383
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,600
they're [ __ ] fire but I can vouch

384
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,339
them

385
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,720
no no no no no I didn't you could have

386
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,579
told me they weren't infused and I

387
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,959
wouldn't even know so that's what we're

388
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:12,778
super stoked on we came up with the

389
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,518
recipe and we use a nano THC yeah

390
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,659
um that really provides no cannabis

391
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,659
taste and also when you're baking it in

392
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,519
the kitchen smell it's a quick onset to

393
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,019
the nanotech yeah we're really excited

394
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,120
about it I know some people are starting

395
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,220
to actually

396
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,259
make smokable versions of it which is

397
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,959
really interesting I think it's best

398
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:34,458
suited for topicals and edibles but yeah

399
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:37,500
it hits way faster past the pith to mace

400
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:39,919
pass the pith to mace Max what do you

401
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,919
think of the cookies

402
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:47,100
that's a 305 Hayes Miami Heat's right

403
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,620
there

404
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,040
for all you kids out there this cookie

405
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,039
is amazing delicious yeah it really is

406
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,039
honestly

407
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,940
I can't really taste hash in it are you

408
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,879
technically one of the owners Gabe of

409
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,820
this Cookie Company I am an investor

410
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,620
owner CEO what are you so me and two

411
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,000
other partners one of which Otis OG is

412
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,379
my oxygen is not here today the other

413
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,940
partner Ben is in the kitchen making

414
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,620
cookies and shout out to Ben for making

415
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,160
these delicious cookies today yeah shout

416
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,620
out to Ben and for putting them

417
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,360
Ben's in the kitchen cooking up

418
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,578
um and he developed this recipe which

419
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,019
I'm so happy that I didn't have to do

420
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:31,078
because it would not be nearly this good

421
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:33,720
oh 100 so so do you know if he's

422
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,399
infusing the butter or no where it's

423
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,639
actually we're making the cookie mix the

424
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,639
dry mix and so it is a nano THC

425
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,680
alongside a neutral carrier it it looks

426
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,959
very similar so it's like it's like a

427
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,939
crystalline it's like Crystal that it's

428
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,859
okay and so we're having to then just

429
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,139
homogenize it into the mix okay very

430
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,379
cool um which is harder easier said than

431
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,480
done 100 we're getting into Edibles and

432
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:59,539
doing mass production we just finished a

433
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,560
200 000 piece order it's [ __ ]

434
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:03,599
congratulations thank you I appreciate

435
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:06,000
it but it's it's it's a pain in the ass

436
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,400
so are you doing we're doing gummies and

437
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,720
are you using your your rosin we weren't

438
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,240
for this order it was just some

439
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,100
distillate order but down the line we

440
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,779
want to get a line together of rosin

441
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,338
edibles but

442
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,259
I feel like you have to approach the

443
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,298
market in a certain way because I was

444
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,160
talking to I'm not sure if you know but

445
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:25,798
Dank Tank yeah yeah the homie yeah

446
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,720
absolutely he's he's real he's a homie

447
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,099
but he sees things very far in the

448
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,360
future and we were chatting with him

449
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:32,819
about it and

450
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,379
he just feels that either the demand is

451
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,418
going to be so much that you can't keep

452
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,039
up with it that there's not enough rosin

453
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,500
to really

454
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:43,079
eat it you know but that's the whole

455
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,599
idea right yeah this was always like you

456
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:49,319
don't want that

457
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:51,779
I have to say I respectfully uh hold a

458
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,178
different position because yeah but you

459
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,558
don't want to be well the

460
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:57,840
industrialization of something creates

461
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,000
this thing called the standing reserve

462
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,759
and that standing Reserve effect almost

463
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,500
limits the quality of like the

464
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,200
production so it's always going to be

465
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,880
like the mythical one percent of hash

466
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,460
right but then we got to have to feed

467
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,100
the masses so I think he's understanding

468
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,600
what is like yeah it's like that right

469
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:18,298
there you know it's something convenient

470
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,099
sorry to strip you of whatever you're

471
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:22,558
saying and just spend you on a different

472
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,719
topic But but so

473
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,160
I don't know if you guys follow Bloom

474
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,440
Seed Co

475
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:34,320
so Harry Palms I I appreciate I

476
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,480
appreciate him so much he's he's like

477
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,038
way further in the game than anybody I

478
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,380
feel so him and his group they're

479
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,879
starting to discover my partner could

480
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,419
talk way more about this because he's

481
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,419
very very like

482
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:48,419
the the triploids

483
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:56,720
no have you no have you seen about uh

484
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,720
triploids no tell me tell us

485
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,038
so it's basically normal clones and

486
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,720
normal cuts of weed it's a they have two

487
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:05,339
chromosomes so triploid it has three

488
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,000
chromosomes and what it does is it

489
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:10,740
affects the genetic like stability in a

490
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,599
sense of it that it won't be able to get

491
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,519
pollinated wait can we step back a

492
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,500
little bit where are these things are

493
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,759
they their nature or they exist it's

494
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,558
existed in nature it's been a thing

495
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,779
since the 90s people have been growing

496
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:24,420
crops of triploids before it just hasn't

497
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:26,700
been uh look looked into

498
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,860
[Music]

499
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,660
exactly yeah there's skunk there's

500
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:32,659
triploid skunk that people were growing

501
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,580
in the 90s

502
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,080
that's a force a forced mutation or how

503
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:39,599
does that work it's a natural mutation

504
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,339
that that occurs and people people have

505
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,558
noticed what it does they've been

506
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:45,659
starting to study it more and more and

507
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,220
then what is Harry doing with that so

508
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,980
what they've noticed is that you're able

509
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,298
to control THC percentage and trichome

510
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,120
growth so they're saying that you could

511
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:56,879
get a 300 Micron trichome imagine

512
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,918
dabbing just one [ __ ] trichome

513
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,140
is

514
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,120
feels like a would be the resin would be

515
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,400
too heavy I remember I mean so that's

516
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,719
what that's their further thought of it

517
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,220
but so the whole idea of what they're

518
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,400
doing right now with it is so that they

519
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,100
can do 100 Acre crops of high yielding

520
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,780
High strains and it not get [ __ ] by

521
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,418
the hemp Fields next door that are gonna

522
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,099
seed it with the pollen and the reason

523
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,780
being it's not because they want to [ __ ]

524
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:24,899
on the market of hash it's that they

525
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:27,119
want to stop ethanol extraction to where

526
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,519
there's so much outdoor rosin produced

527
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:33,659
that you could be using rosin instead of

528
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:36,720
distillate and he just posted uh not him

529
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,860
but his partner 707 uh I forgot his

530
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,919
Instagram

531
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:43,379
he just posted uh he's seating 100 acres

532
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,280
of crops Auto flowers that are gonna

533
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,960
high yielding hash strain autoflowers

534
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,879
that are gonna be cut down I forgot when

535
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,940
but in a couple months and he's like

536
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:59,160
waiting wait until you see a hundred or

537
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:03,380
a 50 gallon barrel full of rosin well

538
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:06,058
culture forward exactly in a lot of ways

539
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,220
it also is going to set a standard that

540
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:09,599
the people are going to have to

541
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,220
increasingly so like they're saying in

542
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,538
the comments people are like why are you

543
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,640
gonna do this you're going to mess with

544
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,140
the traditional hash Market or all the

545
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,840
artists in hash I think that's an

546
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,160
approach that is realistic it's undoable

547
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,199
and that's but it's not what they're

548
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,019
trying to take down they don't want to

549
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,840
be anywhere near like The Artisan hash

550
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:31,798
or any quality kind of hash thank you

551
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:33,599
they're just trying to get Mass outdoor

552
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,720
rosins to production to where the cost

553
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,399
is low enough so that you can cut out

554
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,259
ethanol extraction and this yeah then

555
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,900
you're having a more pure expression of

556
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:45,058
the terpene and of the exactly that is

557
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,798
they're also in my mind the one concern

558
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:49,259
I'd have with that is not so much about

559
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,720
what it would do for production but more

560
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:53,220
what it would do to Terps because there

561
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,419
are just things that don't don't and

562
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,819
they're Terps that I like that don't

563
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:01,080
dump and that's the smoke and flour over

564
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:03,058
dho so are you are you uh are you cons

565
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:04,980
like do you care what Terps you're

566
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:06,720
getting in your Edibles yeah no exactly

567
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,659
no yes okay and there we go yeah hell

568
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,759
yeah so that's exactly so they don't

569
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,039
give a [ __ ] about that you know like so

570
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,500
so going so good and that's what them uh

571
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:19,980
where he's going uh distillate for

572
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,200
example people started Ryan uh um

573
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,538
distill an entire plants like we're

574
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,480
talking about stock and everything the

575
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:29,279
whole league yeah the whole plant and uh

576
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,259
like he said when you're doing Edibles

577
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,079
you're not really focusing on the Terps

578
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:35,460
like at all mass production also you

579
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,399
could do so much with it you know

580
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,779
elixirs all this other new [ __ ] that is

581
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,320
gonna come out everything that came out

582
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,819
showing distillment it's gonna be uh

583
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,558
it's gonna be like uh you're gonna

584
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:49,619
replace it with rosin people are gonna

585
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,298
go buying the rosin decarb pills on the

586
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:54,359
shelves now there's gonna be rosin

587
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:56,700
lotion rosin lip balm everything and

588
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,038
none of this has to have high amounts of

589
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,298
turps no 100 I think that I was not

590
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,640
thinking about it right I assumed that

591
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:03,839
it was all getting smoked no 100 million

592
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,000
and so that's what I'm saying is

593
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,619
everyone thought that that's what

594
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,599
they're going for but they're saying we

595
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,339
don't want any part of that market we're

596
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,439
trying to attack this Market the cool

597
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,418
side of it is that with the triploids

598
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,279
and the auto flowering that they're

599
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,980
messing around with you'll be able to

600
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,918
chop down your harvest in 60 days

601
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,079
it'd be a high yielding High strain and

602
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:27,600
on top of that you can manipulate the

603
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:29,699
THC percentage and trichome size

604
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,759
so it's like there's so many benefits to

605
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,900
it Peter what are they oh oh sorry what

606
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,980
are they saying in the comments I feel

607
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,740
like the comments will have thoughts

608
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,140
about this we're just recording oh okay

609
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,460
well in theory you all would have had

610
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,538
feelings about that

611
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,220
um

612
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:45,298
but no it's super interesting and I

613
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,279
think that

614
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,720
you know it seems very novel right now

615
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,740
but I think a lot of the crops hearing

616
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,000
stuff that's happening right now you

617
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,259
know pushing the plants like you were

618
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,259
talking about

619
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,558
25 years ago that was it just opens a

620
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:00,779
lot of opportunity because think about

621
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:02,099
the chances that people are going to get

622
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,740
because their crops aren't going to get

623
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:07,379
pollinated you can grow anywhere now you

624
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,620
could grow literally anywhere and What

625
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,620
markets are they mainly looking at

626
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,619
it

627
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,819
you know just up north like literally

628
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:21,298
just big farms was like the Oklahoma

629
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:22,500
type World anything like just what are

630
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:24,179
the what are the benefits of these

631
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,240
triplets you're talking about so it

632
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,440
stops uh cross pollination you can't get

633
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,200
the plants can't get can't get

634
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,900
pollinated and they're saying that it

635
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,720
can mean you're able to manipulate the

636
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,940
Vigor of the plant THC percentage and

637
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,159
trichome growth and so I guess I

638
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,679
understand why they would be sterile

639
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,360
sorry like the sterility makes sense to

640
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,220
me with the three

641
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,259
chromosomes but I guess I don't

642
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,038
understand sorry I'm paused let me grab

643
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:54,538
my friend because he he'll help shmom

644
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:57,740
come talk I'm talking about triploids

645
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:57,740
come come inform the people

646
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,918
I appreciate it

647
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,579
he's the he's the big brain yeah he's

648
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,619
good I mean I appreciate though that you

649
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:10,759
you guys well because we're really

650
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,759
passionate about it

651
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:16,139
so wait I have I have a question for you

652
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:20,158
yeah hello I fundamentally understand

653
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:22,320
why triploids would be sterile I don't

654
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,299
understand how you can then steer the

655
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:28,678
resin production

656
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:31,558
um so basically the idea is

657
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,500
it came from an Instagram post from uh

658
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:37,379
707 gross

659
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,220
707 underscore grows

660
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,799
um

661
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,759
and he's affiliated with Bloom Seed Co I

662
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,700
think

663
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,319
uh so he predicted that the future is

664
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,460
basically going to be

665
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,980
distill it free because

666
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:56,100
triploids that produce like six percent

667
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:57,839
uh resin Autoflower triploids

668
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,158
um are going to become the next thing so

669
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,859
people are planting like hundreds of

670
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,400
Acres of this and basically they're

671
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:09,058
unhindered by uh CBD Farms so if there's

672
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,278
a farmer that has male CBD plants right

673
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:13,259
next door it has no effect on it because

674
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,519
they're sterile

675
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:16,558
um

676
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,639
and that means that there's going to be

677
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,379
a lot of

678
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,200
not clean but there's going to be a lot

679
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,520
of really cheap outdoor rosin uh from

680
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,340
these autoflowers because they're going

681
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,778
to be dumping six percent in 60 days and

682
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:29,399
that's where we started was we were

683
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:31,259
talking about sort of what it would do

684
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,640
to the market but I guess what we're

685
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:34,019
curious about is sort of the mechanics

686
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,600
of I guess it is just that you have

687
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:38,460
Elite genetics that are now autos and

688
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,859
sterile right and so they will dump

689
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,240
there's nothing about the that steers

690
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:43,859
them towards dumping or am I

691
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,240
misunderstanding no so what steers them

692
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,619
towards dumping is simply the genetics

693
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,798
yes they're going to be elite genetics

694
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:48,798
yeah

695
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,740
um

696
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,500
Bloom seed co-feminized triploids are in

697
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,700
the works and will be available soon

698
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,099
triploids are plant varieties that have

699
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,860
three sets of chromosomes experiencing

700
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,839
hybrid Vigor heterosis it makes

701
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:06,240
everything bigger bigger plants larger

702
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,058
larger trichome heads increased terpene

703
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,640
and THC content and are sterile this

704
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:13,379
allows Farmers to the ability to plant

705
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,960
triploid seeds next door to an

706
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,580
industrial hemp farm with Acres of males

707
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,019
and not be affected as they do not

708
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:21,119
accept pollen

709
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:23,460
if you could plant Acres of hash dumpers

710
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,859
that aren't affected by Rogue pollen and

711
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,538
produce kilos of of rosin cheaper than

712
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:29,699
disti what would be the benefit of

713
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:31,558
traditional ethanol distillation

714
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,360
I think the rosin is going to replace

715
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:35,099
the disti market in the next few years

716
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,439
especially when Bloom seed coat times

717
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:39,298
automatic genetics collabs are done and

718
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,100
farmers are pulling seven percent crops

719
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:43,819
in 60 days it's going to be game over

720
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:43,819
for Dusty

721
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:47,959
genetics

722
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,960
it's it's

723
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:52,919
the technology to back it up

724
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,259
it makes sense

725
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,059
no 100 and the other thing too is how

726
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,798
they're in introducing the autoflowers

727
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,119
into it because on this other post he's

728
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,480
talking about him

729
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:05,038
uh seeding the 100 acres and he says

730
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,960
that he's gonna be hard he's gonna

731
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,460
harvest the field and have it replanted

732
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,500
by August 1st

733
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,900
and we had the homie last week and a

734
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,099
couple weeks ago on Jeremy Nori who in

735
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,778
addition to doing the secret cup

736
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:18,298
historically

737
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:21,419
now does the Autoflower yeah and so he's

738
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:23,339
seeing the evolution of early BHO and

739
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,440
his vision now of what's coming next in

740
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:26,819
the market are 100 and so I think it's

741
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,519
interesting that this sesh where you'd

742
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:31,798
expect people to not be super into Autos

743
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,778
it's coming up well because all those

744
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,119
used to be so frowned upon like it was

745
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,500
just something that people to throw on

746
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:41,219
their porch would be growing you know

747
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,859
but now it's being utilized as

748
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,940
how quick they can flower that it's like

749
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:46,619
people are like this is going to cut

750
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,700
down on production time how can we use

751
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:49,379
it you know

752
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,880
so and I feel like that's kind of what

753
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,500
the industry is stepping into is

754
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,778
everyone taking a step back and looking

755
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,640
at what have we missed and how can we

756
00:28:54,778 --> 00:29:00,240
benefit from these things you know

757
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,538
there's a lot of little nuances that can

758
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,480
help a lot around the community I feel

759
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:08,819
do you have like another example

760
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,038
uh honestly no that's the best to put

761
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:14,099
you on the spot no no I know it'll come

762
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,298
come to mind I feel throughout the night

763
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,859
well you said that there would be

764
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:18,298
applications for like Edibles you know

765
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:20,839
more broadly whatever the other

766
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:23,519
placements

767
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:25,980
now I understand what you're saying Okay

768
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,079
um think about the people that are

769
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,538
coming into the market that are older

770
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,240
than us like the new the

771
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:34,798
the stigma of being a stoner is kind of

772
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,019
going away people are educating

773
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,240
themselves on what they can benefit from

774
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:42,119
the product

775
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,058
there's there's oil oil-based there's

776
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:47,099
topicals there's

777
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:48,599
several things my grandma [ __ ] smokes

778
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:52,158
a vape pen before a night for her

779
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:52,158
glaucoma in her eyes so

780
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,699
mine are too strong for her

781
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,079
yeah patches a lot of uh there's a lot

782
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:06,298
there's a lot of menstrual stuff coming

783
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,178
out for like women and there's really

784
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:11,940
big things that people are looking into

785
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:14,038
so so on another note to the lady I met

786
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,679
so your question cannabis anal butt Lube

787
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:18,778
yeah there's [ __ ] lube and [ __ ] Bro

788
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:22,259
there's there's support a small business

789
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:24,298
yeah but to bring up uh I feel like a

790
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:26,700
thing

791
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:28,619
another topic like you're saying that

792
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,679
has been on my mind is

793
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:34,199
but everyone everyone talks about it but

794
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,840
how THC percentage doesn't matter

795
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,640
I understand that everyone understands

796
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:40,379
that but what I feel like we need to

797
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,440
start looking more into is how the

798
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,399
terpenes affect us because that's the

799
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,860
biggest

800
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,719
thing that affects you I feel like think

801
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:52,019
about how lavender makes you sleepy

802
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,179
peppercorn makes you awake like the

803
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:58,679
certain terpenes gives you certain

804
00:30:54,179 --> 00:31:00,480
effects is live exactly and I feel like

805
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,038
that's that's very I feel like that's

806
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,960
very overlooked

807
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:05,940
no it is and I mean I think that yeah

808
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,860
the term education is

809
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,220
you know there's some Australian

810
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:13,199
supplications

811
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,519
no but there's more there's more there's

812
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,500
missing out there's a lot that you're

813
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,240
missing out on it's the same thing as

814
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,940
all the [ __ ] someone trying to

815
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,339
explain how a strain will affect uh

816
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,740
affect you like oh it's a cerebral

817
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,619
effect like the [ __ ] does that mean bro

818
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,079
how do how is it gonna get me high

819
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:33,178
what's the high like not like how's your

820
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:34,558
spiritual [ __ ] being like you know

821
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:37,140
what I'm saying

822
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,058
I feel like there's things that we can

823
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,940
look into with the Terps that you can

824
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:43,678
actually put a pinpoint expression of

825
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,940
what it's going to give and also what's

826
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,278
like beyond the Terps like the

827
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,740
flavonoids flavonoids there you go

828
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,058
exactly cannabis you know all of these I

829
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:56,038
forgot who we were talking we were

830
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:58,500
talking with four and uh here right here

831
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:02,220
so I was at Green Street this was about

832
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:06,119
two months ago and we had a new string

833
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:08,100
called spoiled fruit it's not new but uh

834
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,979
what I did was uh

835
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:13,558
I opened this up we were like about

836
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,500
eight people there was there was no

837
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,720
flowing air it was it was all still we

838
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,839
smelled it we smelled one thing and then

839
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,659
I got a like the fan hit me I smelled

840
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,699
the same exact jar it smelled different

841
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:28,380
and I looked a little bit weird I looked

842
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,000
off because I was like dude this doesn't

843
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,159
smell like anything that you guys are

844
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,619
talking about and the thing is it's like

845
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,240
20 30 people against me with just one

846
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,699
person and I'm like no all you

847
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,579
[ __ ] are wrong and so what I

848
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,980
did was I went under the uh the AC vent

849
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:46,740
I I opened it again and I called

850
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,899
everybody back to under the vent and I'm

851
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,419
like smell it now and they're like holy

852
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:53,278
[ __ ] it's crazy over there where there's

853
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:56,038
no air it smells like strawberries in

854
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,859
front of the fan it smells like GMO so

855
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,179
you know sometimes like yeah maybe a

856
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:02,459
little knucklehead but I had to do that

857
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,720
just to prove my friends that you know

858
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,220
what I was talking about I was trying to

859
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,019
get my point across

860
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,360
I mean you go pass it around but once

861
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,879
again it's uh it smells it smells more

862
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,339
like strawberry and then you put it in

863
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,539
the fan it smells like GMO can I see

864
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,538
that stuff

865
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,139
oh absolutely they're volatile I mean

866
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,399
you're experiencing it firsthand because

867
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,399
you're fresh pressing stuff

868
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,500
what you're seeing in the jar no and I

869
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,240
mean honestly though some of those

870
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,679
terpenes that are volatile at room

871
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,319
temperature the most caustic like when

872
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,720
I've taken dabs fresh off the breasts is

873
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:48,200
when I'm the most blown out Gabe off the

874
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,179
top of my head when Pele polar brought a

875
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,980
flavonoids versus terpenoids I could

876
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:55,140
just think of blue cheese you know blue

877
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,480
cheese smells a little disgusting to me

878
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:00,059
but you dig into it it's all sweet and

879
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,339
creamy because so the breakdown the

880
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:03,960
oxygen exposure smell versus taste

881
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:05,579
creates a chemical reaction and that's

882
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,259
the whole thing with hash is like the

883
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:09,059
uniqueness is that it's stable and

884
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:11,398
preserved but it can still be like

885
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:13,259
transformed subtly over time because of

886
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:15,239
different and that's like if you go to a

887
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,679
moist environment you go to a dry you go

888
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:23,658
to a beach it's gonna you know cannabis

889
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,659
why did we say give parmesan cheese

890
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,879
some one of those lactose it's not urea

891
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:33,440
right

892
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:33,440
now it's like a bacteria

893
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,379
oh it's the um I forget what it is

894
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:03,199
butyric acid is what gives parmesan

895
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,199
cheese its smell

896
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:10,259
let's get technical cannabinoid

897
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:12,358
compounds in hash let alone weed so as

898
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,400
it oxidizes it's going through those

899
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:15,659
phases

900
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,940
yeah and that happens with tea and

901
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:22,559
what's rain and other things

902
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:24,300
2009 [ __ ] CBN thcv all those

903
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,940
different compounds they are expressed

904
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,160
and that's what oxidational special like

905
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,260
Temple balls five years old Temple balls

906
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:33,420
exactly one thing I learned was like you

907
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,099
can wash the hash it's very durable so

908
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,619
like you can get boiling water and hit

909
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:39,180
some old hash or whatever and let it dry

910
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:41,460
in the Sun and then you've got these

911
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:45,118
unique trips and break into you know

912
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,880
it's like a like a crust that preserves

913
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,780
the inner hash so yeah are these your

914
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,180
terms yeah yeah these are our church

915
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:57,359
how does that smoke bro it's really

916
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:59,519
smooth I mean the high doesn't last me

917
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,679
too long but it is smooth as well that's

918
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,780
because it's the tier two oh definitely

919
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,299
I'm just listening let's talk about that

920
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,800
is that how are you doing is it first

921
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,280
wash versus second watch like what are

922
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,260
the coolers to me I have a bit of I

923
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,060
don't hate calling stuff Tech because

924
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,820
it's the same thing back to how I was

925
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:21,420
saying about the I like hash makers that

926
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:23,820
grow their own stuff as well because

927
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,559
there's no Tech in half in making hash

928
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,300
you can make cash that's gonna be super

929
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,739
super harsh because there's a lot of

930
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,000
plant matter in it but if it's Fire

931
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:32,699
Starting material it's going to taste

932
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,619
fire and look fire so when they say Tech

933
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:38,159
I think they're just saying uh their

934
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:40,140
processed terminology their process you

935
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,739
know the process is basically

936
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:44,400
um

937
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:45,779
we depending on weight of the wash and

938
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,700
what the strain is because certain

939
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,980
strains wash way quicker than others

940
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:50,699
depending on the nug structure

941
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,838
um

942
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:57,539
we do our second to third wash and

943
00:36:54,838 --> 00:37:00,420
separate our 90 through 159 for our

944
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:02,639
premium tier one what we packaged we put

945
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,680
our side label on top label and then our

946
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:09,299
tier two we just put a top label on and

947
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:12,358
that's basically our 73 through 189 new

948
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:16,500
of the

949
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:18,179
later washes and the lower and the upper

950
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,820
heads of the first through third wash

951
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:24,299
mixed into it word if that makes sense

952
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,220
it does yeah so yeah so we and that's

953
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,900
also what goes into our pens is the tier

954
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:30,480
2 rosin

955
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,660
which I'm I'm not afraid to say it

956
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,619
because it's [ __ ] fire absolutely

957
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:37,019
sort of to the conversation we were

958
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,280
having earlier because you're doing a

959
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:39,659
broader range of heads there's going to

960
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,180
be a broader range of experiences

961
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:44,699
exactly and more spectrum of terpenes

962
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:47,639
and flavonoids to be able to taste

963
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:51,358
that's where it comes into players why I

964
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:54,659
don't I I believe in the not the 90 and

965
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:57,059
upper heads are the most ripe the most

966
00:37:54,659 --> 00:38:00,659
developed trichome heads but I don't

967
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:03,000
believe in doing 90 through 103 or 93

968
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:06,059
120 I want to get as close to where

969
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,059
there's like 91.89 or some [ __ ] like

970
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:10,739
that 93 189 93 159 if I can get as

971
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:13,139
little plant matter through I'll get to

972
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:16,379
the biggest screen I can because those

973
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:19,500
bigger heads have such Rich sugar like

974
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,539
church especially especially if the

975
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,280
genetic like I know it's gonna Contour

976
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:25,739
but like a Tangy like where even the

977
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,780
leaf has like a suite you know so that

978
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,939
when you get those filtered you're not

979
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,680
getting like an unwanted taste you're

980
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,179
getting that slight other resin from

981
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,799
there you're getting the pure expression

982
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:36,239
of what the plant wants to give you you

983
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,460

987
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,420
thought it didn't smell like garlic

988
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,980

989

want your guys's opinion let me know

990
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,559
yeah I want everybody's opinion stuff

991
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:58,858
stuff so this is my buddy out in uh

992
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:00,838
Kentucky his uh Mr Auto grow he works

993
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:03,719
closely with Bloom Seed Co he does a lot

994
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,400
of personal Fino hunts for them uh he

995
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,199
sent me this cut a few months ago this

996
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,760
and some grape guava the grape guava

997
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,019
didn't do too well but we're gonna try

998
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,460
and get the garlic juice back because

999
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:13,619
this one's a [ __ ] funny because I

1000
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:16,559
have a homie who gets like six percent

1001
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:19,440
off the grape guava which speaks to

1002
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:22,679
different pianos no 100 well no it's not

1003
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,420
necessarily I just I'm picky when it

1004
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:26,879
comes to that those guava crosses

1005
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,920
because I've done so many of them that I

1006
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,320
just I don't like when it's heavy on the

1007
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,300
strawberry guava you know because I'm

1008
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,500
tired of that guava terp

1009
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,420
I

1010
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,358
we and the thing that sucks is we had a

1011
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,338
really killer Fino we had a strawberry

1012
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,460
bubbles it was Mimosa times strawberry

1013
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:46,980
guava and we had a killer Fino of it

1014
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,960
that it was straight Mimosa candy and a

1015
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:52,139
little guava on the back end but it only

1016
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,179
yielded like 0.5 percent to rosin but it

1017
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,519
was the best flower I've ever had this

1018
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:58,379
is a gassy garlic juice oh yeah correct

1019
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,599
right it's not like a common garlic

1020
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,579
juice right well garlic juice can go

1021

00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:06,740
um

1108
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:12,960
but yeah take one there they are

1109
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:17,279
medicated four milligram Nano that's

1110
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,358
cookie that's uh cocoa and salts

1111
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,079
okay

1112
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:25,159
that was our first run in Coco no so the

1113
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,780
the spoiled fruit was

1114
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:30,118
rockwool and then the super Booth was

1115
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:32,579
Coco

1116
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:35,039
so the and the cocoa but you just still

1117
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:36,839
ran the same salt formula yeah same salt

1118
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,980
formula and everything nice and then

1119
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:39,539
we're gonna

1120
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,460
reintroduce so like I was saying that

1121
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:42,659
was our first run we didn't get crazy

1122
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,300
crazy numbers because we weren't

1123
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:46,799
expecting it we only got I think four

1124
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,780
and a half percent on the super Booth we

1125
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,760
were expecting 5.6 because that's what

1126
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,619
we normally get

1127
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,720
um but we had no foliaries we didn't

1128
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:57,358
have any beneficials nothing in the room

1129
00:44:54,719 --> 00:45:01,019
so honestly we crushed it because we got

1130
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:03,598
2.27 a light with nothing just literally

1131
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:05,940
just feeding it nutrients and that's it

1132
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,079
so I'm excited for the next few runs

1133
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,880
because I feel like we're gonna get some

1134
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,818
really good numbers out of it the next

1135
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,280
room that we have coming in uh

1136
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:18,358

popping I'm going for some kind of older

1304
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:59,219
green gas crosses like some chem stuff

1305
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,980
um and uh some OG crosses that are just

1306
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:04,199
green to green and then uh some lemon a

1307
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,000
lot of lemon crosses so I've been as I

1308
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:07,679
travel around everywhere I go I've I've

1309
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,480
been asking everybody for for what they

1310
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,639
have in the lemon Realms so I've

1311
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,920
collected a handful of lemon packs so

1312
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:17,299
I've got you know like a dozen or more

1313
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,300
people's lemon crosses

1314
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:23,400
you know just a bunch of guys lemons

1315
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:24,480
lemon lines it's gonna be fun so what

1316
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,880
are you looking forward to the popping

1317
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,219
the most out of those lemon packs

1318
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,858
um I know flying lion research Sean he

1319
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:33,598
he gave me a lemon hash plant on Lemon

1320
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:36,000
hash plant

1321
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,680
um whichever another one that I just saw

1322
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,420
the other day that looks really fun to

1323
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,838
go through

1324
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:45,838
um who was oh I got a um Hawaiian Bud

1325
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:49,078
lines uh from Hawaii it's uh they're

1326
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:51,420
they're Citrus I mean like uh it has so

1327
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:53,220
much Citrus in it so that's not truly

1328
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,480
lemon but that's in the Citrus world

1329
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:57,058
might get something that kind of leans

1330
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,760
that way but had like all the Citrus

1331
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:01,740
um and then uh what was the other one oh

1332
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,040
um

1333
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:07,618
you know uh Russell Char genetics just

1334
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,179
gave me a couple of his uh lemon crosses

1335
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:11,400
that he was doing because he had a lemon

1336
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:14,578
hash plant too

1337
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:17,639
um and then oh uh Jake from 808 genetics

1338
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:19,019
he gave me a some lemon peels all right

1339
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:23,759
he had a bunch of different lemon things

1340
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:25,980
which is like a uh lemon macaroons to

1341
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,660
lemon something so that that that should

1342
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,858
be a fun fun one to go through so yeah

1343
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:30,960
like I said there's just a bunch of

1344
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:32,699
lemons in there that's great and Eric we

1345
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,079
all got kind of hot and we glossed over

1346
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:36,000
it but if you want to just introduce

1347
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,460

1348
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,760

foreign

1350
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:55,318
yeah we uh we do all organic nutrient

1351
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:58,140
line uh we've been have been able to

1352
00:54:55,318 --> 00:55:01,558
come out with a uh soluble organic

1353
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:04,078
nutrient that'll you know totally uh run

1354
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:06,359
through all your fertigation systems and

1355
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,160
then um yeah we've got

1356
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:10,318
supplements and everything you need the

1357
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,000
whole whole organic fertilation it's

1358
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,639
good stuff fertilizer line thank you

1359
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,440
yeah we enjoyed we enjoyed I wish Otis

1360
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,639
was here to talk about how we used it

1361
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,380
yeah yeah

1362
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:22,259
um we were really happy yeah thanks

1363
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,818
that's you know going down the terp

1364
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,700
profile and into that world you

1365
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:29,219
definitely you know your inputs matter

1366
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:33,419
you know and so if you want to get right

1367
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:36,539
now we need to uh I want to send the

1368
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:40,440
whole lineup to a grower who's gonna go

1369
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:42,480
on YouTube and we can do like watch them

1370
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,460
do a grow along with all your just

1371
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,940
running your stuff definitely I'd love

1372
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:49,199
to yeah let's do it that's what uh you

1373
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,539
know it's all about getting it getting

1374
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,460
the fertilizer in The Growers hands and

1375
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:55,858
to get the content and I feel like

1376
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,960
you're always doing sort of r d and

1377
00:55:55,858 --> 00:56:00,119
looking towards the future what are you

1378
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:03,780
working on right now uh you know an

1379
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:06,838
organic micro nutrients so we can get

1380
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:09,240
into like a true organic hydroponic

1381
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:11,818
system is going to be uh going to be

1382
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:13,679
next and so an organic cream like you

1383
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:17,279
could effectively drip food correct

1384
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:18,539
effectively drip feed into cubes or into

1385
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,500
into

1386
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:25,980
um you know dwc or into

1387
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:29,119
um you know hydrogen what's that

1388
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,119
most likely

1389
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:34,078
yeah

1390
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:36,059
yeah the key is solubility and state

1391
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,160
stability too so yeah we're working

1392
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:40,740
through that and we're in a true organic

1393
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:42,539
cow mag that's soluble as well that

1394
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:43,739
could be passed through so those are a

1395
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:45,739
couple of things we're working on right

1396
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:49,679
now is there any Community against

1397
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:51,479
calling uh liquids like organic or

1398
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,519
anything like that

1399
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,380
um any Community against calling liquids

1400
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:57,900
organic yeah even though they're organic

1401
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:00,318
like fertilizers and all that whether

1402
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,318
it's like

1403
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:05,880
accepted just yeah

1404
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,920
like um

1405
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:11,640
you know yeah you have liquid Organics I

1406
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,980
mean our fpf is 100 organic non-GMO

1407
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:17,338
organically stabilized basically food

1408
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:19,318
grade you know so that's our um our

1409
00:57:17,338 --> 00:57:23,338
fermented grains and that has fulvic

1410
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:25,980
acid amino acids enzymes that's awesome

1411
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:27,659
um and the key right there is the aminos

1412
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,818
and the fulvic acid because I'm a huge

1413
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:32,279
fan of uh anything that's easier to keep

1414
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:34,679
the grow clean you know instead of using

1415
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,559
soil all the time absolutely yeah no

1416
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:39,598
this uh you know the what the fpf

1417
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:42,119
supplies is powerful lots of energy for

1418
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:44,780
the plant from the fermented grain

1419
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:44,780
for sure

1420
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:52,379
Bank

1421
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,030
how do you feel about uh veganic growing

1422
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,539
Style

1423
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:59,180
[Music]

1424
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:59,179
what's this tier two yeah yeah

1425
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:09,059
it's probably got some limit on it too

1426
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,940
I'll do that [ __ ] that I was talking

1427
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:15,359
about it's totally awesome he said this

1428
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:17,880
is life damn yes super smooth for me I

1429
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,199
couldn't tell well they do some indoor I

1430
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,220
couldn't tell you specifically but I

1431
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:25,119
think they mostly lights up

1432

very good

1435
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:42,539
uh one of like the true best examples of

1436
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:44,818
terroir as I mentioned before they grow

1437
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:47,000
literally on the coast right above the

1438
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:47,000
water

1439
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:54,838
this is someone else's jar I feel but

1440
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:57,740
yeah that is the brand here it's good

1441
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:57,739

Kevin it's cooler than yourself

1445
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:36,960
that is not cooler than this one

1446
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:38,939
I think it's pretty goddamn cool I think

1447
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,079
it's on the same level but I just saying

1448
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,079
how cool do you think this is

1449
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:48,558
you see he said it's cool it's not that

1450
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,559
cool it's cool

1451
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:02,220
that's a good tool it's a handy it's a

1452
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,219
you know multi-tool

1453
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:07,500
well you'd have to you know use it to

1454
