but i think probably my biggest

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,359
international claim to fame is as one of

39
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,959
the founding members of the group mystic

40
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,078
revealers which

41
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,399
is not by any means a very

42
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,319
well-known reggae group but we are

43
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,640
authentic and

44
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,639
we have um

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,799
we are known in the music circle in

46
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,800
jamaica for what we have done we had a

47
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,719
few hits over the years

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,560
that um transcended the jamaican

49
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,359
marketplace and

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,800
exposed us to marketplace in europe and

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,879
and japan and north america south and

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,560
central america as well

53
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,519
you know yeah

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,000
the group the group um was assigned to a

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
number of recording labels over the

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
years

57
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:37,359
so we've worked with with labels like

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,199

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,280

little more i i just was very fascinated

91
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,438
that you have a um surf school there on

92
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,438
the beach right there

93
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,840
yeah right here right here at johnny's

94
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,318
yeah you know we have a surf we've been

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,719
i've been surfing since the 60s you know

96
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,878
yeah so surfing i've been a surfer for

97
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,400
way longer than i even was a musician

98
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,280
you know we didn't get the band together

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,719
until about 1978.

100
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,919
all right so we got the band together

101
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,160
you know but

102
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,639
for at least 10 years prior to that i

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
was surfing here in jamaica so surfing

104
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,639
was a

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,160
was a a part of who i was you know the

106
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,079
park growing on the beach here and

107
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,520
there's the sea is rough here in bulbay

108
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,159
most of the time

109
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,159
so we're going to swim and catch the

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,600
waves which we didn't know was surfing

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,840
at the time because we hadn't been

112
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,240
exposed to surfing you know we didn't

113
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,560
know anything about hawaii and

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,560
and california and that sort of thing we

115
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,360
just knew our little local knowledge in

116
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,600
the 60s and we knew if you swam with a

117
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
wave and you swam fast enough it would

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,080
pick you up and take you along for the

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,478
ride

120
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,639
and we got little pieces of wood that we

121
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,800
could hang on to and swim and we used to

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,879
call them belly boards lie down on our

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,759
belly and come in so we got into surfing

124
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,120
from that time you know yeah so over the

125
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,800
years

126
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
um

127
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,079
this on the journey we've been through

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,199
my wife has always wanted to have some

129
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,359
kind of

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,439
tourism offering you know but she was

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,919
more thinking of like a place up in the

132
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,120
mountains a kind of holistic life sort

133
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,439
of thing

134
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,439
um but because we weren't financially

135
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,360
well off enough to

136
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,038
maintain occupy and maintain two

137
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,120
different properties on

138
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,800
opposite end of the island opposite

139
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,000
sides of the island

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,879
um we had to narrow down our vision

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,079
so the idea during my touring around

142
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,079
when bands started to tour i was exposed

143
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,680
i got a chance to go to california we

144
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,839
were touring the east the west coast of

145
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,918
the united states and

146
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,399
we i've been surfing all my life and by

147
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,038
this time i was like about 30 years old

148
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,599
32 years old with kids and everything

149
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,318
finally getting to go to california

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,439
and travel up and down there and saw the

151
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,280
surfing environment saw the surfing vibe

152
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,719
you know i mean you said whoa you know

153
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,959
people up here would really appreciate

154
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,199
what we have in jamaica because in my

155
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,839
mind by that time i had been exposed to

156
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,400
surfing now i had gotten magazines their

157
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,799
uh vhs cassettes of surfing were

158
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,478
available on the market and as a surfer

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,120
i'd buy them i take them home to soda

160
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,599
cheese so we kind of saw the waves that

161
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,079
were being pursued internationally and

162
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,639
the quality of the waves but were under

163
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,439
the misconception that this is how the

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,759
waves were always in these other places

165
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,279
we didn't realize that wow

166
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,960
the images we are getting from these

167
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,799
world-renowned surf locations where

168
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,959
those images of the best days of the

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,478
year we yeah we grew up thinking like it

170
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,038
was like that every single day of the

171
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,038
year in hawaii or california

172
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,839
so when we found out that that's not the

173
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,159
case and it came down to start a reality

174
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,560
we realized we had a really a wonderful

175
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,960
setup in jamaica with like 300 days of

176
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,399
surf a year you know i mean no crows

177
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,000
lots of different spots with high

178
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,000
quality surf

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,478
you know i thought and say well you know

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,399
maybe if we open a little surf camp

181
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,800
i'm sure we could find enough people to

182
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,959
fill our few little rooms that we could

183
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,720
create on our little space where we

184
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,560
could put some tents and things like

185
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,800
that you know people would come and tie

186
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,280
up a hammock for ten dollars a night and

187
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,360
it would supplement our income you know

188
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,679
so let's go for it and we establish the

189
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,840
surf camp and it grew from just being a

190
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,319
little place of our own

191
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,758
to world-renowned amnesia that people

192
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,000
from all over the world come here for

193
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,360

exactly like sunset beach so

264
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,200
yeah we took it from them that that's a

265
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
good comparison

266
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,879
that's cool bro

267
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,159

um what instruments do you play mystic

270
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:18,399
um i don't like to claim to be a

271
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,759
instrumentalist but i

272
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,639
i am

273
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,480
i'm a mainly a singer songwriter

274
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,639
and i use a guitar

275
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,920
to do my songwriting

276
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,199
so i'm not a guitar virtuoso by any

277
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,078
means

278
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,839
i do play with the band and most of the

279
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,120
time when you're recording the rhythm

280
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,519
guitar is usually me sometimes i'll add

281
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,240
a few little phrases here and there

282
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,240
um i do play bass you know this is

283
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,240
probably my favorite instrument even

284
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
though i'm not the bass player

285
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,879
um

286
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,519
i would say it was my favorite thing and

287
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,399
i've you know i do a lot of percussion

288

289
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,799
as well yeah you know i like the

290
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,000
percussion on your music yeah but i

291
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:04,719
would not i would never knowing

292
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,600
the musicians that i do

293
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,079
in the reggae industry and their caliber

294
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,159
of talent yes i would never be so

295
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,399
forward as to present myself as a

296
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,600
musician i much rather say i'm a singer

297
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,200
songwriter

298
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
well that's cool

299
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,440
so

300
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,920
uh

301
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,560
who are your musical influences

302
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,759
i noticed you have quite a like a range

303
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,278
of of

304
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,799
types of

305
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,799
songs very cool yes yes

306
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,199
mystic revealers we were

307
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,439
one of the reasons why

308
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
many people didn't know about us

309
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,920
is because

310
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,959
we're very difficult to put into a box

311
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,439
you know

312
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:48,000
we're not you can't just say we're roots

313
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,480
or we're dance hall or we're

314
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,879
dub or we're you know

315
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,959
we are musicians you know

316
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,039
i'm a songwriter who

317
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,518
writes

318
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,519
emotionally in terms of how do i feel in

319
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,159
the moment just you know growing up in

320
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,240
jamaica you're exp you're exposed to

321
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,559
international music you know when i grew

322
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,320
up there was just two radio stations it

323
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:15,518
was rjr and jbc and it was

324
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,040
am frequency very poor quality sound and

325
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,959
that sort of thing you know

326
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,759
so you all the only thing that was

327
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,439
played on jamaica radio was recordings

328
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,319
that were

329
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,399
the best quality possible so most of the

330
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,040
music you heard on the radios in jamaica

331
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,759
was hit parade music from not america or

332
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:36,078
britain you know and not enough and some

333
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,958
productions because there was one or two

334
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,519
major recording studios back in the 60s

335
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,399
that who had the capacity to produce

336
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,000
music at the level that when the record

337
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,159
was produced you could actually put it

338
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,639
on a turntable and play it on an am

339
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,319
frequency and send it out there and you

340
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,720
could actually hear what was going on a

341
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,680
lot of early jamaican music was

342
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,720
um the iconic music was recorded in in

343
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:03,120
very low quality recording studios you

344
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,519
know two track and four track and eight

345
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,159
track and a lot of that music was was

346
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,919
not able to be presented on the radio

347
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,039
yeah in those days they would call that

348
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:16,240
music dancehall music it wasn't a genre

349
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,399
it just meant that music that was not

350
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,639
really fit for airplay and not fit for

351
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,000
airplay because of lyrics or

352
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,200
content but just due to quality

353
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,278
so those music now would be played on

354
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,560
sound systems in the dancehall because

355
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,919
that's dancehall the sound system is uh

356
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,000
is the signal path for a sound system is

357
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,399
way different than a radio station the

358
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,559
radio station just takes the signal from

359
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,159
the needle puts it through an amplifier

360
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,759
and send it out in a mono signal out

361
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,838
over the airwaves

362
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,319
with a tone you can either tone it high

363
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,279
or low or in the middle

364
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,480
the early recording the early um sound

365
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,078
systems had a crossover system

366
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,759
where they took that

367
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:02,958
the signal from the needle on the

368
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,480
turntable

369
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,399
and they put it

370
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,039
into a

371
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,039
four band

372
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,879
splitter that would

373
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,359
select the frequency you could say okay

374
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,838
we select the bottom end all those

375
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,519
frequencies

376
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,160
right send them to nothing to our

377
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,078
equalizer you know

378
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,759
it's like you could set

379
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,638
the parameters

380
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,039
of the audio signal so you had they

381
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,639
would set it up so you had base

382
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,559
coming out of this

383
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,720
thing it would go to an amplifier of its

384
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,518
own and be connected to the base beams

385
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,959
then they would have low mid frequency

386
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
coming out of

387
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,719
out of another

388
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,879
thing it would go to amplification

389
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,600
equalization and go to the low mid

390
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,240
speaker cabinet then you have the high

391
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,240
mid that will go same procedure so it

392
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,799
was a four band

393
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,198
wow it had four bands of separation so

394
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,759
when the record was being played

395
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,838
you had more audio control in the sound

396
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,759
system than you did on radio radio

397
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,720
basically just had to be good on the

398
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,039
record

399
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,639
if it wasn't it wouldn't sound good

400
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,159
right the sound systems they could put

401
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,399
this record on that was made in some

402
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,319
chinese studio and if the low mids

403
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,839
needed boosting they could lose it if

404
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,399
the bottom head needed boosts you know

405
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,320
the high ends behind me the vocals was a

406
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,799
bit low they could turn up the high mids

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,560
and not affect the bottom end responses

408
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,039
you know so with that four-band

409
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,439
crossover that they implemented

410
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,519
it allowed the music to be played and

411
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,040
heard on a much higher quality than it

412
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,198
could possibly be heard

413
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,719
on the radio and this is living in

414
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,958
bulbasa

415
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,040
where i grew up now we're just it's a

416
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,439
sound system place we have liquid copper

417
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,838
island in the sun around me theater

418
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,600
paradise scope a lot of these places

419
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,199
back in the day where the sound system

420
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,879
would come to play that room we would

421
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,039
come up from country

422
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,039
and

423
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,399
a lot of the top sound system like in

424
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:06,479
the 70s socialist roots and and stir gav

425
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,320
and all of them type of sound system

426
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,480
always used to play in the area yeah

427
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,800
yeah so in those early times i was

428
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,959
exposed to this type of music

429
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,879
that was on the radio

430
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,719
because the quality and not meant to be

431
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,039
coming from abroad and i would be

432
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,560
hearing all of the local stuff that was

433
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,159
being played by the sound system that

434
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,198
you would not hear

435
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,439
under it

436
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,198
so i had a very wide listening scope

437
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
that affected me

438
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,719
so if i was going to narrow down now and

439
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,479
say who were some of the people whose

440
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,959
music affected me

441
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,920
yeah well i used to love listening to

442
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,919
music

443
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,759
i used to love listening to

444
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,360
freddie mcgregor

445
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,879
dennis brown

446
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,199
alton ellis

447
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,439
gregory isaacs

448
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,319

449
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,800
in that time also you know i mean yeah

450
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,040
buddha is kinda

israel vibration

452
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,319
you know well

453
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,838
these are the groups that i would listen

454
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,279
to and love you know a lot of the music

455
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,360
that was being played by jollof music

456
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,918
you know a lot of the 12 tribes of

457
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,879
israel artists you know on orthodox

458
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,439
labor

459
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,600
it's funny you would say that because

460
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,640
yesterday somebody was telling me

461
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,519
about uh israel vibration

462
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,919
yes israel vibration and a lot of other

463
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,599
acts that came out through not that

464
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,000
musical outlet which is the twelve

465
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,678
tribes of israel and the music body of

466
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,160
the twelfth tribe of israel you know a

467
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,400
lot of those acts then is brown freddie

468
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,640
mcgregor god these artists come out

469
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,038
through here you know yeah

470
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,720
tribe of israel you know so yeah all of

471
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,640
these artists were

472
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,880
musicians and artists that we were

473
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,360
exposed and familiar with

474
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,679
in terms of international of course it

475
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,240
was all the rmb artists

476
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,120
you know influenced us you know

477
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,839
all of those rmb groups you know yeah

478
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:00,479
well i certainly saw in terms of reggae

479
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,000
we used to love we love when steel pulse

480
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,079
came on the scene

481
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,599
you know and as well that was very

482
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,038
interesting for me

483
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,199
because

484
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,759
steel pulse didn't sound like a man who

485
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,360
was trying to sound authentically

486
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,720
jamaican you know

487
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,519
as what was a ban that was in england

488
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,120
but was probably the most authentic

489
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,679
jamaican sound band at that time

490
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,479
yeah we admired steel pulse because

491
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,559
that thing was different and it did have

492
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,120
an international flavor to it that made

493
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,119
it different

494
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,839
absolutely yeah my granddaughter can we

495
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,839

530
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,440

in the late uh 70s

538
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,279
we had been through a few drummers

539
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,480
previously and a number of different

540
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,839
keyboards and so on but by 88

541
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
um

542
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,000
it was myself and lion

543
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,038
who had founded the group in the 70s and

544
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640

00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,158
johnny came on board about 88 so 87 he

546
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,840

547
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,200
three of us and there's been a large

548
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,038
number of

549
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,558
people who have come out on board and

550

635

636
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,200
respect in the industry i was in a

637
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,679
position where i could basically call

638
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,038

675
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,480
tired of this yeah you know

676
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,440
so

677
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,440
i had garage band on a tablet and i made

678
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,120
a few trucks i put a few trucks on the

679
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,360
garage band and say

680
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,439
you know i think i i don't care even if

681
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,798
it's on garage band i'll put it out you

682
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,720
know i'm gonna do it so i just want to

683
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,278
get this music out here

684
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,360
so i made a few demos on garageband and

685
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,359
i was listening to it i say

686
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,278
you know if this technology is available

687
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,119
on this tablet i'm sure there must be

688
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,440
some

689
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,000
available technology that's

690
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,640
maybe on a production level you know yep

691
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,038
so i did some research and i found out

692
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,400
that yeah you can do stuff and i can and

693
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:25,278
i got access to

694
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,360
a

695
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:31,278
program somebody suggested a program to

696
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:33,599
me a music song editing program

697
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:36,400
i downloaded it to my laptop

698
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,839
i went out and i interested about a

699
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,759
bearing job 18 xr 18 which i said which

700
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,359
i would recommend to anybody interested

701
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,919
in recording

702
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:48,959
give me a 18 input

703
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,720
uh ability so i could actually record we

704
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,038
could set up the whole band and record

705
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,440
live it had enough input into the thing

706
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,839
as usb connection to the

707
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,240
laptop so that basically gave me a

708
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,639
studio right on my veranda

709
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,480
and most of the tracks i think about of

710
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,200
the 12 tracks i think probably about

711
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,360
eight or nine of them were recorded on

712
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,880
my veranda here in boulder you know

713
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:15,119
really so yeah and voice right there i

714
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,320
mean if you had access to the original

715
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,239
tracks i could

716
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,599
solo vocal tracks and you could hear my

717
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,839
grandkids running around in the

718
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,839
background you know so it's a

719
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,398
it's a very natural

720
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,000
song we use but i mean everybody who

721
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,439
asked me where did you record this and

722
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,839
nobody believed that it was on the

723
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,200
veranda because the audio quality

724
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:37,759
still tends to make you think it was

725
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,600
recorded inside a countrywide studio

726
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,398
yeah i i thought it was in one of the

727
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,798
studios in jamaica and you have horns on

728
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,319
there that sound amazing yes i use a lot

729
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,440
of hands i use

730
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,439
i'm for life horns yeah and i've always

731
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,440
been friends right one second

732
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,720
i used to be very upset we got a record

733
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,759
company

734
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,919
um it would mean three more tickets and

735
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,480
we were already a huge aggregation on

736
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,799
stage like he had nine people on stage

737
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,599
plus school yeah when we went on tour it

738
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,639

739
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,719

you know

775
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,879
before we are some young group and

00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,319
you're assigned to atlantic records and

777

album and he comes in and you give him a

782
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,640
song and he says why don't you put a

783
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,480
bridge here a bridge would really be

784
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,320
nice here listen you could go to from

785
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,919
that you could go to a d minor there and

786
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,359
then

787
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,320

788
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,398
writing on your on your album and the

789
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,599
song don't sound like what it sounded to

00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:54,479
you but

791
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,278
because

792
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,839
this record company is spending 50 or 60

793
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,398
000 on your production you can't just

794
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,398
say [ __ ] you because you don't have a

795
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,000
you don't have a million selling record

796
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,759
you know under your belt where you can

797
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,079
dictate to them yeah they're promising

798
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,558
to make a star out of you you know so

799
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,960
you so this new album i didn't have to

800
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,519
deal with any of that i couldn't i

801
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,360
didn't have recording studio class i

802
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,278
didn't have to book studio time ahead

803
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,678
and be out of there because there's the

804
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,240

again tonight you know what i mean and

811
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,918
that gave me such amount of control and

812
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,640
because

813
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,960

817
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,679
you know relaxing and very low stress

818
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,759
environment to create the music so well

00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,199
ended up getting mixed on the veranda

840
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,399
that were recorded in some of the other

841
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,640
studios you know are you getting airplay

842
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,759
um we get an airplane on surprise we'll

843
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,759
never get getting airplay but jamaica is

844
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,000
so technically

845
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,440
up to date now you know i mean everybody

846
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,440
has

847
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,679
a program that you can buy

848
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,679
you know yeah they have some sort of

849
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,519
service you know they have a promotional

850
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,159
thing and it includes x amount of

851
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,759
players per week and yeah yeah x amount

852
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,080
of radio stations and it costs 2 000 u.s

853
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,720
dollars for the first month and then

854
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,439
whatever whatever and you know and when

855
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,240
you pay them then all of a sudden your

856
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,558
your music starts playing mysteriously

857
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,359
on a lot of radio stations you know yeah

858
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:23,278
so

859
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,599
we haven't we don't have that kind of

860
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,960
budget behind us so as i say i made this

861
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,639
music

862
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,278
for a special people who would go out

863
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,919
and discover it and have it like a like

864
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,519
a very precious thing that's not readily

865
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,320
available something you've never heard

866
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,839
about and wonder why you know this is

867
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,319
this is the avenue we're going down with

868
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,480
our thing so we're hoping that maybe

869
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,720
because we don't have that type of

870
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,599
support in terms of promotional support

871
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,798
around it we're more going for maybe a

872
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,959
long-term gradual snowball effect

873
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,000
because the songs being the fact that

874
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,278
they are not

875
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
tied to any

876
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:04,720
production sound traditional sound like

877
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,599
it's not chokmak or it's it you know

878
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,640
it's not

879
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,319
a producer song yeah yeah it's our song

880
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,640
which is unique so whenever if you hear

881
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,319
it this year or next year or the year

882
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,960
after it's not going to be so easy for

883
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,558
you to time stamp it because it's on

884
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:25,399
some rhythms that were produced in

885
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:25,398
2018. so now yes time stamp with 2.98

886
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,558
it sounds like it would be a great uh

887
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,558
big hit in hawaii i mean i took a trip

888
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,480
to hawaii and you know turned on the

889
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,918
radio stations and they're all freaking

890
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,960
playing reggae

891
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,960
you know

892
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,038
and i have a friend over there really

893
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,038
judah really judah i think he's

894
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,278
c kcr c or something like that radio you

895
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,919
know kawaii

896
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:00,640
yeah even though song players doing

897
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,600
yeah yeah big up to really judah but

898
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,038
then support you know that's cool

899
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,439
um

900
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,039
so you know some of the rhythm sections

901
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,159
almost sound like like they were

902
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:15,199
recorded together live were they or they

903
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,679
just are live it's our live recording no

904
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,158
we don't really use any loops the only

905
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,878
song that was used with a drum machine

906
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,760
and looping was kiss for me which we did

907
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,239
with

908
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,280
with natural light

909
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,078
yeah they

910
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,480
i wanted something on the album young

911
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,560
and feeling like what was going on

912
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,878
locally at the time we did the album so

913
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,239
that that would be able to timestamp the

914
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,319
album for me

915
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,239
you know that collaboration with what

916
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,359
the youngsters who were on the cutting

917
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,039
edge of producing this kind of trap type

918
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,598
song thing you know yeah yeah the

919
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,279
traffic i just gave them that and they

920
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,039
they did that so apart from that

921
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,760
everything else is live

922
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:58,400
it's live recording live drama beasts

923
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,520
drama country off our rollout and we lit

924
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,358
the reading man if it's not steady we

925
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:04,880
because we're not under student time

926
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,319
pressure we were able to say all right i

927
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,400
don't like that take let's go again

928
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,480
let's go again yeah maybe not today

929
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,800
let's try it again tomorrow all right we

930
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,199
can we try it on the weekend you know so

931
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,560
we are time to to do that sort of stuff

932
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:21,279
so the album is a lot of a lot of one

933
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,199
take yeah you know but the vocals are

934
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,160
one tape vocals

935
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:28,319
most of the vocals were the guide voice

936
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,799
that was laid at the time when we were

937
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,559
laying the rhythm yeah um

938
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,119
a couple places maybe we would have to

939
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,559
punch in a few little fat spots but we

940
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,200
tried not to

941
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:42,239
interfere with the production very much

942
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:44,399
you know i mean i mean a lot of spots my

943
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,559
son was concerned about my voice going

944
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,320
flat at certain points and i told him no

945
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,320
i want to keep that i want it real i

946
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,160
don't yeah i don't want some some

947
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,760
something that we'll go back and punch

948
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,519
that in and punch me in there and punch

949
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,040
me in there and punch me yeah yeah yeah

950
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,320
yeah that's slightly flat this is a

951
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:02,159
little bit late going into this life now

952
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,400
let's do it it's a real thing it's like

953
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,039
a live show i wanted to feel real live

954
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,800
you know so yeah almo it was as a result

955
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,519
of that

956
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,359
that concern why the album has this feel

957
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,199
that it does you know yeah it has a

958
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,400
great irie vibe

959
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,679
if i understand ivory

960
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,800
so

961
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:23,199
do you play

962
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,720
uh reggae festivals or are you planning

963
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,719
to after things open up after this

964
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,879
pushing a q-tip one foot up my nostril i

965
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,760
just can't

966
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,960
manage the the covey test where they

967
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,960
push that thing way up

968
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:47,118
like it's a brain test they want to see

969
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,039
do you have any brain up there

970
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,119
all the way okay yes you have some brain

971
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,440
when you impact on your your brain are

972
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,400
at the top of your skull i can't handle

973
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,280
that bro

974
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,880
i cannot unleash

975
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,920
i mean they try to put something up my

976

nose and i eat my drug i just grab it

977
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,358
out i know it's a natural reaction i

978
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,358
have it it's not if it's not like a a

979
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,799
swab in the mouth or something like that

980
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,239

987
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,320
okay

988
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,559
i mean i'm too old now i've lived so

989
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,400
long that i you know i don't want to

990
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,838
take up too much space for too long on

991
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,000
the planet they're talking about the

992
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:35,759
place being overpopulated i don't want

993
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,880
to live to be too old and become a

994
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
problem

995
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,240
so

996
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,480
i hope that y'all will protect me and i

997
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,639
know that none of us were born into this

998
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,480
world to live forever and we all got to

999
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,519
come somehow and go

1000
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,358
somehow

1001
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,159
so i want to be

1002
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,159
as happy about my time here as possible

1003
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,960
and enjoy it as much as i can you know

1004
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,399

1005
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,639
the covi thing

1006
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,599
yeah and the vaccines and all that

1007
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,679
because

1008
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,519
i don't see it around me you know maybe

1009
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,679
if it gets a lot more serious and people

1010
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:10,239
actually are dying that i know

1011
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,759
and i see sick people around me and

1012
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,759
every day i hear about somebody else

1013
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,720
from my community who has gone to the

1014
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,119
hospital and may not return but i don't

1015
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,118
have any proof of any of that from where

1016
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,880
i am i hear it on the radio oh there's

1017
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,200
all these people but

1018
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,838
you know i don't i'm not experiencing in

1019
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,239
my my community of bulby i don't see it

1020
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,759
and funnily enough bulbay was ground

1021
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,000
zero the first

1022
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,480
the first case that was identified in

1023
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,480
jamaica was identified just about a mile

1024
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,240
down the road from me and

1025
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,400
so far i i

1026
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,000
i don't really know anybody who has died

1027
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,960
or anything i know some people who have

1028
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,960
had it

1029
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,519
you know who have been tested positive

1030
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,679
and were isolated and when i spoke to

1031
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,119
them they said well if nobody had told

1032
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,879
them it was kovi they would have just

1033
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,200
thought it was just an ordinary flu

1034
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,400
because one of their symptoms were any

1035
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,480
different than a normal flu closer yeah

1036
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,240
well not stable

1037
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,679
and it's not dangerous you know i'm not

1038
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,639
saying it's not dangerous and people

1039
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,159
shouldn't be

1040
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,920
be concerned you know i'm just saying

1041
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,559
that me personally

1042
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,079
i i put my my faith in the most high you

1043
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,239
know and if yeah

1044
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,920
was lined up to take me out i don't

1045
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,000
think a vaccine is going to be able to

1046
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,838
stop it from getting me you know well i

1047
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,239
think if you're out there surfing your

1048
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,000
your uh endorphins are going to keep you

1049
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,039
immune probably

1050
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,079
maybe

1051
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:32,480
you know so let's talk herb for a minute

1052
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,079
since it is 4 20.

1053
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,960
yeah blessed 4 20. yeah bless up

1054
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,640
um

1055
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,159
how long have you been partaking of the

1056
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,480
sacred herb

1057
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:45,039
um you know the first

1058
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,358
i mean of course as little tiny kids we

1059
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,119
would find jamaica is everybody smoke

1060
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,078
weed so yeah yeah when there are little

1061
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,160
kids

1062
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,320
i figured that maybe in north america

1063
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:57,440
the equivalent would be a bit of finding

1064
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,440
somebody's cigarette butt and lighting

1065
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,480
it up and taking a pull on it

1066
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,880
so

1067
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,119
that is basically all we really started

1068
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,480
as kids you know yeah yeah so much weed

1069
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,079
being smoked all over the place

1070
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,880
sometimes you're lucky enough to find

1071
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,200
like a joint that somebody lit and it

1072
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,599
went out and it fell our last and you

1073
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,838
end up finding it so from we were very

1074
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,480
young we got into that type of thing i

1075
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:23,119
would say before i was

1076
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,159
10 or 11 years old we had already

1077
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,440
lit up and pulled something and cast and

1078
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,920
that's other thing but in terms of

1079
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,920
actually getting access to weed for

1080
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,838
myself and and

1081
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,838
partaking and

1082
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,239
saying that i smoke weed and being able

1083
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:43,039
to declare that i was

1084
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:45,759
probably about 14

1085
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,519
years old 15 years old

1086
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,800
yeah i think i've been smoking since i

1087
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,480
was 12.

1088
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,359
yeah

1089
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,079
so

1090
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:57,440
um how what has the herb in jamaica

1091
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,440
changed over the years

1092
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,679
over the years well in the beginning you

1093
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,359
used to smoke a lot of seedy bush you

1094
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,358
know yeah yeah

1095
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,358
yeah

1096
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,400
yeah i didn't even know how to

1097
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,799
make a joint you know when i was smoking

1098
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,720
yeah yeah it wasn't one you found we

1099
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,839
were smoking a chalice you know yeah

1100
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,879
yeah

1101
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,440
so it was not very high quality weed you

1102
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,280
know it wasn't a connoisseur thing

1103
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,159
you know it was

1104
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,000
uh much more like smoking a cigarette as

1105
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,879
opposed to doing jobs

1106
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,880
yeah yeah so the whole the whole

1107
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,838
experience of marijuana in jamaica was

1108
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,318
a much more casual leisurely

1109
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:48,239
undertaking as opposed to like let's go

1110
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,159
down in the basement and get high you

1111
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,239
know it was yeah yeah yeah it wasn't

1112
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,598
that kind of energy so in jamaica when

1113
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,078
you said drug

1114
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,838
nobody thought marijuana yeah they

1115
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,920
thought lsd

1116
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,838
you know cocaine

1117
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,280
you know pcp something you know some

1118
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:08,078
kind of manufactured thing was what yeah

1119
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,240
so marijuana wasn't even included as a

1120
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,200
drug in our mindset because

1121
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,838
grandpa small grandma small uncle jerry

1122
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,639
small my

1123
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,199
father

1124
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,799
everybody exposed to it and

1125
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,039
it wasn't like people were having to

1126
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,400
hide as i say in the basement to go get

1127
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:29,358
a toe you know people would smoke

1128
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,039
mr brown was a policeman live across the

1129
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,679
road and him smoke too

1130
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,920
no smoking uniform you know but when him

1131
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,239
at home his son smokes and he doesn't

1132
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,119
lock up his son you know what i mean so

1133
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,959
it was a much more socially acceptable

1134
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,358
uh pursuit

1135
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,760
in jamaica so we never really had that

1136
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,159
kind of

1137
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,000
connoisseur type thing like wow this we

1138
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,519
got to go hide and get high as quickly

1139
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
as we can and then get out of there

1140
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,920
before the cops find us you know yeah

1141
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,839
yeah it wasn't that type of environment

1142
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,318
yeah so nowadays with with the new herb

1143
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,318
thing and high times magazine and all of

1144
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,679
this we've seen a lot more of those

1145
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:10,239
designer

1146
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,759
marijuana know what it is you know and a

1147
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,399
lot more people

1148
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,119
are smoking marijuana nowadays and used

1149
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,079
to so you find out that most of the new

1150
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,680
users of marijuana are very much into

1151
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,440
the quality

1152
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:28,239
and high-grade type of thing right and

1153
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,039
elders obviously love good marijuana

1154
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,799
absolutely i'm not out there to get this

1155
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:35,759
thing that you take one pull and you

1156
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,119
gotta go to sleep you know yeah

1157
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,160
so let me ask um

1158
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,838
two things i have a question about one

1159
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:45,679
do you know about the lamb's bread

1160
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:48,318
technique

1161
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,078
i wasn't really a herb plantain but i

1162
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:52,639
know that lamb's bread in those days it

1163
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:56,800
was it was like you know when you see it

1164
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,799
we we'd have a lot of crystals on it

1165
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,519
in those days

1166
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,480
when i was back talking about the late

1167
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:06,480
60s early 70s when people tell you about

1168
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,719
lamb's bread

1169
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,400
you said lamb's bread

1170
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,318
but really what it was coming from was

1171
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,358
lamb's breath

1172
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,480
really the breath of the lamb yeah yeah

1173
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,000
yeah

1174
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,400
like when you

1175
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,280
put your mouth over the under on on a

1176
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,480
glass and you see the breath show

1177
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,920
those crystals you know yeah on the herb

1178
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,639
on the hair of the herb and you see

1179
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,680
those crystals it was like condensation

1180
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:35,118
of the lamb's breath you know

1181
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:37,118
so that was one of the i said some

1182
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,119
people call it lamb's bread

1183
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,920
yeah you know yeah there was a lot of

1184
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,000
things but lamb's bread was for us was

1185
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,000
just it just meant very high quality

1186
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,159
weed to most of the lay people you know

1187
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,679
it was right and as i said i wasn't a

1188
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,920
herb farmer

1189
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,078
yeah so i wouldn't know what were the

1190
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,240
procedures that would categorize one

1191
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,240
weed as lamb's bread and the other one

1192
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,078
as whatever you know

1193
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:04,159
you know we know that centimeters no

1194
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,359
seed you know yeah in 1975 i came to

1195
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,559
jamaica

1196
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:11,920
and i went to negril and i met a

1197
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,639
rastafarian named referred ward

1198
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,440
and

1199
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:19,039
he took me up to his grow and he told me

1200
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,280
that lamb's bread or breath was

1201
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,279
when you would cut the top just after it

1202
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,040
started butting you tuck cut the top

1203
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,240
eight inches off put it back in the

1204
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:29,358
ground

1205
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:31,679
and it re-roots like a clone anyway

1206
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,199
yeah it's possible it's possible and i

1207
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:35,440
would not tell you that you're wrong you

1208
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,759
know you can't educate me as much too

1209
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,000
because you know if i was

1210

1215
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,358
tremendous amount of seeds we would cut

1216
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,119
up the weed and put it on the board and

1217
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,639
