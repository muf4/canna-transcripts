1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,919
back out in the woods there are a ton of

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,559
mushrooms all over this fallen tree

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,198
let's see got some down

4
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,358
here little oyster mushroom type of

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,800
thing I'm not a myologist I don't know

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,720
y'all can always help me out we got some

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,719
of these big Brack

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,439
mushrooms we

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,840
got this here it's not turkey tail

10
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,399
something else but there's it's loaded

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,399
on the bottom end of the tree with

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,640
them it's

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,399
covered more of them as I grow out the

14
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,640
side we got some big bracks on

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,719
top anyway I'm going to grab some of

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,280
these

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,679
mushrooms and just see what eventually

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,679
I'll do with

19
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:00,039
them all right nice little spot that I

20
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,558
found a lot of good sponge wood you can

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,960
already see how this has just totally

22
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,280
turned to beautiful what I call native

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,879
soil I'll come back and get every bit of

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,280
this this whole log is sponge

25
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,280
wood look at

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,280
that starts getting hard there boom get

27
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,118
soft right here on the end all this on

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,320
the end be great look at that big let's

29
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,920
pull this chunk off see what we look

30
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,239
like that guys that's all sponge wood is

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,280
is super duper soft look at the

32
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,519
beautiful mycelium

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,239
growing come

34
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,718
on come

35
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:47,239
on and that's why stump wood is

36
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:49,798
fantabulous sponge wood all that good

37
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,199
stuff go out and Hunt guys get it look

38
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,600
at the size of this tree guys that goes

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,600
for a long ways splits at the top

40
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,399
there's tons of good stuff on a good old

41
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,319
dead log like this that's a big one

42
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,159
first of all that means I'll be coming

43
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,719
back out here for years to

44
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,360
come oh here we go I want to show you

45
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,000
this this is what's great about stumps

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,160
this is a crease of it all right here

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,719
what I would call native soil but this

48
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:21,919
stuff is simply dark humic

49
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,359
soil look at that y'all I could take

50
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,839
that home and I could grow cannabis in

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,800
it and me I grow anything in that right

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,759
there but that's so full of humic acids

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,160
that kind of stuff will adust just pH

54
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,399
naturally you can make add the native

55
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:38,400
soil to your imo3 to make a native soil

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,480
im4 like I've shown but I will come back

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,000
and I'm just going to scoop stuff like

58
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:46,679
that out from the cracks it's perfectly

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,598
broken down

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,920
wood

61
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:58,759
gorgeous beautiful large

62
00:02:53,919 --> 00:03:01,759
stump but up top is what I'm looking at

63
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,759
watch

64
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:13,280
that that'll break up real fast whenever

65
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,920
I make IMO 3 with it that is sponge wood

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,400
it's sponge because it'll soak up as

67
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,598
much water as a sponge whe this stuff is

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,158
nice and dry this is a type of material

69
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,878
that I could take back and make bokashi

70
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:27,840
with it you can Bashi any dry organic

71
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,919
matter so good

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,479
stuff all right so this is one thing we

73
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,559
talked about on Friday Night Live with

74
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,280
Mi beneficials and at rubber ducky

75
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,120
isopods when the leaves are down there's

76
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,318
nothing in your

77
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,039
way spot mushrooms a long ways away you

78
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,399
see them over

79
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,519
there lots of them let's go see what

80
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,039
they look

81
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,039
like o these are pretty white ones real

82
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,759
pretty just totally undisturbed I don't

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,640
know the names of it just a basic Brack

84
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,679
mushroom

85
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,399
yeah real nice again I can take these

86
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,159
home shred them you could ferment these

87
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,280
um I've never done a fermented extract

88
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:14,199
with these this type of mushroom but I

89
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,439
plan on trying it with a lot of

90
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:20,199
different mushrooms lyen funy these got

91
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,439
really big here oh wow look guys look at

92
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,639
those big

93
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:30,240
ones look is my hand some fatties

94
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,600
there real pretty all right right found

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,800
some big fatties I going to cut one off

96
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,520
to show you how big they are they're

97
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,520
angled

98
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,879
[Music]

99
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,879
down pretty nice size right

100
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,759
there four holdes on the bottom no gills

101
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:55,239
you can see it's already breaking down

102
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,800
this stuff would again just that would

103
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,079
make really good soil it'll break down

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,560
it's beautiful dark soil this kind of

105
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,800
stuff I'm looking for sponge wood again

106
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,560
this might be the softest sponge wood I

107
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,400
have found see how thick it is let's see

108
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,199
how far deep it goes into

109
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:18,959
it oh my well it's completely sponge

110
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,600
wood one hard little core in there I can

111
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,439
feel but that is

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,520
all

113
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:29,959
beautiful

114
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:33,038
yep you take that back and you shred it

115
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:36,318
add some acorns to it let it sit you'll

116
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:38,519
have great soil in just a few weeks

117
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,280
stuff you can use in your soil anyway

118
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,918
this right here would just turn into

119
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,918
just soil

120
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:49,800
quick kinds of cool stuff in there good

121
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,918
log and this is called a honey hole the

122
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,280
tree is actually leaned over a little

123
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:58,639
bit so everything falls off right here

124
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,879
you can see how a big massive chunk it's

125
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,439
falling off it's all sponge wood but

126
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,079
this would be what I would get in this

127
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,800
pile this is where the tree fell down

128
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,800
but all of this is just the broken down

129
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,319
log would you look at that soil this is

130
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,720
native soil right here I could take this

131
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,759
back I could grow in it I've done it

132
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,479
before this is Mother Nature's im4 right

133
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,160
native soil tons of microbiology in

134
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,800
there again we imitate what Mother

135
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,240
Nature makes so when I take it into

136
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,120
Gasoline Alley I'm imitating nature

137
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,560
nature does IM o4s imo3 you just got to

138
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,560
go find it this is Nature's

139
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:43,360
im4 another massive massive tree that I

140
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,720
can get right into the middle

141
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,639
of scoop out everything all the bark

142
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,280
it's falling down on the ground that's

143
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,120
all good stuff to

144
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:57,719
shred oh yeah come on now look at

145
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,399
that shred that up you can make bokashi

146
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,520
like I said shred it up using an

147
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:07,120
imo3 use it in im4 shred it up and put

148
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,439
it in your garden break it with a hammer

149
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,639
spread it out on your no tills fungi

150
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:16,478
loves wood this stuff is eaten up with

151
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,478
it see what's underneath the

152
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:26,280
leaves that's that's Mother Nature's im4

153
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,280
right look at that how dark that soil

154
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:32,478
is

155
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,160
excellent all right little tree with

156
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,159
turkey tail old turkey tails on

157
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:43,000
them we get a shot how close we can get

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,120
you can see they're kind of

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,879
fuzzy the base there got the turkey tail

160
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,879
fan and then on the back Spore

161
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,319
holes these are quite old but I'm going

162
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,318
to gather them all up

163
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,439
some big

164
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,279
chunks come back to this

165
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:19,598
log summertime fall

166
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,598
time hit

167
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:30,639
