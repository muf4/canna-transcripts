Regulation and Licensing we find out

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,000
cannabis laws less honorous and more

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,460
fair and discover where the industry is

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,819

37
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,859

38
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,298
are a fan favorite and one of the most

39
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,879
knowledgeable people in the Cannabis

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,979
business today I would have to say thank

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,899
you so speaking of the Cannabis business

42
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,759
let's just get an overview what do you

43
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,200
how is the state of the Cannabis

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,780
business

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,420
the legal cannabis business today yeah

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,719
well right now uh cannabis is definitely

47
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,759
going through uh turmoil there is a

48
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,000
large price compression that's happening

49
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,579
in the industry so for consumers it's

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,239
obviously a good thing because the price

51
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:08,639
of legal cannabis is coming down

52
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:10,258
unfortunately given the the taxes

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,139
um it still has a lot of room to go

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:16,019
because the government's taken a good

55
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:18,899
chunk of that but the price per gram is

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,140
down substantially so consumers are able

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:26,420
to purchase legal tested product at

58
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:29,098
about the price of the illicit market so

59
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:31,738
industry-wise a lot of turmoil because

60
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:35,459
the operators and the business operators

61
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,560
have to uh adapt pivot look internally

62
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,719
and kind of reevaluate their business

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,539
and their company and try to see where

64
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:45,419
they fit um in today's market as far as

65
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,818
the price point and how that compares to

66
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:49,919
their operation

67
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,378
yeah well I have friends that are going

68
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,659
out and getting Ace for 25 and they're

69
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:57,299
calling me up hey yeah yeah it's

70
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:00,060
happening yeah so well that's good for

71
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,260
uh like I said like you say the consumer

72
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,560
right

73
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,079
so here we are in California and I I

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,620
thought to myself

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,959
you're L.A cannabis well how does la

76
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,180
compare to something like another city

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,560
in another municipality like San

78
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,000
Francisco

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,759
yeah so

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,840
different markets La obviously the

81
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,759
county is a lot bigger so our Market is

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,580
bigger compared to the San Francisco

83
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,519
Market San Francisco was earlier to

84
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,800
license uh dispensaries so

85
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,920
they're on additional rounds of

86
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,959
Licensing I think they have uh

87
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,518
oversaturated their Market a little bit

88
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,699
they have a lot more delivery licenses

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,000
the tax rates are are different as well

90
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:50,878
so we differ in taxes La has some of the

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,620
highest taxes in in the state but you

92
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,000
know it's a different Market in the

93
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,580
sense that

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,158
um the Cities laid out different right

95
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,680
so uh you you can't have an area with

96
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,598
too many dispensaries and an area with

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,379
not a lot of dispensaries this is what's

98
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,719
happening in uh San Francisco LA did one

99
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:11,938
thing correct is they went by community

100
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,759
plan area and the community plan

101
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:17,040
determines the density of the area so

102
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,139
they based how many licenses are allowed

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,900
in an area based off of the density

104
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,600
right population density right so some

105
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:28,138
areas of the valley are a lot less dense

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,840
than areas in Hollywood or downtown L.A

107
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,259
East L.A or South L.A have more dense

108
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:36,319
Pockets so they've opened more licenses

109
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,840
in those areas and I think San Francisco

110
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,759
went off of a a cap or they went off of

111
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,159
zoning so a bunch of them have been

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,439
bundled into one area and then they have

113
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,320
these Pockets where there's no not not

114
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,418
too many dispensaries right and how does

115
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:56,040
California compare to other states

116
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:58,799
California is a free market is what they

117
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,460
call it there the state does not have a

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,819
limit on how many licenses can be issued

119
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,859
versus some states who are they call

120
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,639
limited licenses so the state has said

121
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,979
okay 20 licenses 10 licenses for example

122
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,360
Florida they only have 13 licenses in

123
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:18,719
the whole state

124
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,300
so it's a very limited license a lot of

125
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,440
the bigger multi-state operators control

126
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,478
those licenses it's more of a monopoly

127
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,459
or limited license whatever you want to

128
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,199
call it

129
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:33,299
it's not a free market because limited

130
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,280
opportunity right right so limit

131
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,978
operative here it's considered a free

132
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,019
market the state does not have a cap on

133
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:42,240
the licenses long as the local

134
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,000
authorizes it and then we have plenty of

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,939
municipalities here that have no cap on

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,879
the local licenses as well right City of

137
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,579
La has a soft limit and then they also

138
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,038
have a limit on the

139
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:58,439
cannabis the cultivation canopy so so

140
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,259
there's some restrictions here but a lot

141
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:05,339
more free market than some states that

142
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:09,000
have uh very restricted licensing limits

143
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:12,239
interesting and what does a dispensary

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,819
in lip as far as taxes go

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,879
so City of La is one of the highest

146
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:21,659
taxed municipalities in the state

147
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:24,180
recently uh last year they removed the

148
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,120
cultivation tax which was a back-end tax

149
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,639
that the consumers did not get to see

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,240
because it was baked into the price

151
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,759
we had assembly Bill 195 I think that's

152
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,680
the the number of the bill what that did

153
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,038
was it eliminated the cultivation tax

154
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,978
and it moved the tax to the retail point

155
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,860
so now

156
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:49,258
it moved the excise tax which was also

157
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,520
baked into the wholesale price and now

158
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:57,000
they made it based off of the whole uh

159
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:59,339
retail ticket price so it got it turned

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,620
a complicated tax system into a more

161
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,899
complicated tax system but the

162
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,240
legislators thought it was a tax relief

163
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,818
for the industry but ultimately ended up

164
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,639
increasing the taxes by a couple of

165
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:15,120
percent uh because what it did was the

166
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,460
the law was vague on clarifying local

167
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,978
versus state tax and how that was going

168
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:21,959
to be taxed because when you have a

169
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:24,779
excise tax that's baked into the cost of

170
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,659
the good and when a local charges a tax

171
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,818
they get to charge that tax on tax but

172
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,800
now the state went and turned the tax

173
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,319
into like a use tax that gets taxed at

174
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,660
the end and now we have a conflict with

175
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,000
local and state saying oh I'm the last

176
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,740
text and then the state's saying I'm the

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,240
last taxed the local saying they're the

178
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,960
last taxed

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,759
so there's a conflict and now operators

180
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,060
are left with trying to figure out who

181
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,538
to pay the tax to it created a lot of

182
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,639
conflict but uh with that said when you

183
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,620
aggregate the taxes and you stack them

184
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,840
on one another the way the state has

185
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,780
taken that position that you have to

186
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:07,019
stack the taxes on one another it's a

187
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:10,138
tax on tax on tax so a hundred dollar

188
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:12,899
product uh well first you need to charge

189
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,360
the local tax which is ten dollars on in

190
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:20,038
City of La would be ten percent then you

191
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,400
would tax the 15 excise on the 110

192
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:26,759
and then you would charge the 9.5 sales

193
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:29,579
tax on the total with the local and the

194
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:33,839
excise included so it's a tax on tax on

195
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:37,079
tax and It ultimately increased the the

196
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,719
price of the product and it it turned uh

197
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,658
a ten dollar a hundred dollar item that

198
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,360
you would pay a 15 uh before you would

199
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:48,480
pay a

200
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,180
20 uh let's say was a 20 if a hundred

201
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,360
dollar item was a 50 wholesale the tax

202
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:57,539
would be around uh

203
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,339
uh 13 now it's going to be about fifteen

204
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,799
dollars and then if you take the

205
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,360
aggregated additional taxes you're

206
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:07,079
looking at a few more dollars for the

207
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,940
consumer at the end so on top of being a

208
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,920
really high tax compared to other states

209
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,779
we went ahead and made it more

210
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,439
complicated

211
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:18,539
um that then it needs to be really yeah

212
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,339
and I know La cannabis grows its own

213
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:23,519
cannabis which is

214
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:26,420
Top Notch folks uh

215
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,339
so how did getting rid of the

216
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:31,679
cultivation tax affect you

217
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:35,760
so obviously and you have your retails

218
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,799
uh and you so yeah no it definitely uh

219
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,500
for cultivators

220
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,958
getting rid of the cultivation tax was a

221
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,480
good relief the industry needed it uh

222
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,899
the cultivation tax was based off of

223
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,800
weight which no other

224
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:56,039
industry gets taxed that way per se and

225
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,899
the price of cannabis started plummeting

226
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:01,980
so if you look at some of the greenhouse

227
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,480
product it's wholesaling around 350 250

228
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,659
dollars in some

229
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,220
times of the season and if the tax I

230
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,360
think is a hundred and sixty dollars a

231
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,660
pound

232
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,480
so you have a 250 dollar pound being

233
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:18,000
taxed a hundred and sixty dollars right

234
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,740
um it didn't make sense right so I think

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,320
that was an easy sell to legislators

236
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,600
like hey we can't be taxing cannabis by

237
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,760
the pound because the price fluctuates

238
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,639
right they didn't take into account the

239
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,679
fluctuation absolutely so uh they went

240
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,799
ahead and made that correction so that

241
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,958
was a nice relief but then they kind of

242
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,539
took it and flipped it to the retail

243
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,939
side with the excise change so the bill

244
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,679
kind of actually complicated the taxes

245
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,200
so it didn't really

246
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:49,679
I don't think it necessarily helped with

247
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:53,100
uh relief for the overall industry and I

248
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:55,319
don't think the consumers got to see the

249
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,360
benefits of the tax reduction I think it

250
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,540
was so other things that are driving the

251
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,240
price down not necessarily the the tax

252
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:06,419
fix only the legal cultivators that have

253
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,799
no other business benefited mainly is

254
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,120
that what you're saying right right but

255
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,958
then

256
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,820
it didn't necessarily improve their

257
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,179
business as well right right because if

258
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,519
if uh the price was already

259
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,338
coming down I don't think that was there

260
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,899
to does it could it I'll rephrase that

261
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,060
some cultivators might have seen some

262
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:30,480
relief the greenhouse outdoor

263
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:31,619
cultivators saw relief right

264
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,159
and

265
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,679
we were talking about what is it Senate

266
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,899
Bill 512 right

267
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,479
can you tell us about that and what's up

268
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,940
with it yeah Senate Bill 512 so just a

269
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,100
little background I'm on a State

270
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,820
Legislative committee myself so I'm very

271
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,860
involved in what goes on and uh cannabis

272
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,320
bills in Sacramento I'm a part of the

273
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,300
United cannabis Business Association I'm

274
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,860
on the executive board there and I sit

275
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:02,338
on the legislative committee so I'm

276
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,200
constantly digesting bills and how it

277
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,240
affects cultivators and retailers

278
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,180
because I'm involved in both spaces and

279
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,039
a lot of uh my friends in the industry

280
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,679
have asked me to be involved in a lot of

281
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,578
this stuff so I'm very involved in

282
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:19,519
Senate Bill 512 Senator Bradford is

283
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:24,179
championing that bill for the industry

284
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,679
what it is is it's a fix to ab195 which

285
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:29,519
is the bill that got rid of the

286
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:33,239
cultivation tax so it is going to fix

287
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,299
the tax on tax it's not going to allow

288
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,060
locals and states to stack the taxes

289
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:41,759
right um and it's going to address some

290
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:45,778
of the penalty issues because cannabis

291
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:49,139
tax most taxes on almost all taxes in

292
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:51,179
California that are paid to cdtfa if

293
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,778
you're late a day or you miss a payment

294
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:56,699
it's a 10 penalty cannabis is a 50

295
00:12:54,778 --> 00:13:00,360
penalty

296
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,519
which is insane right so let's say you

297
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,459
make an error uh your accountant drops

298
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:09,078
the ball doesn't file the taxes on the

299
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:12,838
31st like they're supposed to Boom 15 50

300
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:14,458
penalty which is just not is there any

301
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,040
other industry where that type of

302
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,719
penalty absolutely not no no other

303
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,458
industry would put up with that right

304
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,200
the the Cannabis industry is

305
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,759
abused in Sacramento

306
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,500
um they are not as organized they're not

307
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,860
as well funded as some other industries

308
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,720
that have Consolidated that have all the

309
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,778
resources needed to make sure their

310
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,778
industry is not choked out of the state

311
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:41,159
but cannabis is not there yet this is

312
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:45,539
why I kind of

313
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:47,519
volunteer a lot of my time uh and uh get

314
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:51,419
involved in these things but

315
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,578
SB 512 is not going to fix the industry

316
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,139
it's gonna fix some of the

317
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:57,838
problems that were caused by another

318
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:00,419
bill so it's definitely an important fix

319
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,480
it'll save the consumers

320
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,039
um on the hundred dollars it can save

321
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,740
them anywhere four to six dollars

322
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,620
depending on the municipality so it's

323
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,120
going to fix a lot of that

324
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,100
ab195 actually

325
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,399
um did a

326
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,519
didn't specify but

327
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,759
was was not was not clear in defining

328
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,799
delivery fees so what cdtfa did was

329
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,259
assume that delivery fees are now

330
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,419
included in the total receipt so they're

331
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,259
actually taxing excise on delivery fees

332
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,899
now

333
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:36,659
uh and the cdtfa has put out guidelines

334
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,940
saying that you have to tax excise on

335
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:41,698
delivery fees that's another thing that

336
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,060
was a problem that was created by ab195

337
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:47,219
which SB 512 fixes so actually delivery

338
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,838
customers will be saving a lot more if

339
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,180
this bill actually makes it through and

340
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,639
and gets on the senate floor so it's

341
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:56,399
actually in a different it's in the tax

342
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,560
and finance committee right now if I

343
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,659
have the committee right so it's it's

344
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,638
got another hurdle to go through and

345
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:04,500
then it'll be on the senate floor for a

346
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,079
vote it's already mated through the

347
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,179
Senate so it's in assembly right now so

348
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,159
it needs to check some of the boxes

349
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,019
there and hopefully it'll be a fix for

350
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,278
some of the problems the industry is

351
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,278
dealing with right now

352
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,500
interesting and what are the chances of

353
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,539
it passing do you think well it passed

354
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,078
uh Senate committees so we were very

355
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:27,778
excited about that it is

356
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:32,039
has some hurdles right now because uh

357
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:34,320
it's in a the tax committee it's in

358
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:39,958
the opponents of the bill are arguing

359
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:42,959
that the intent of the prop 64 was to uh

360
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:47,819
tax put the sales tax on top of all the

361
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:50,219
taxes but uh that's kind of not

362
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,100
the true story behind this build this

363
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,959
bill fixes a lot of other things and

364
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,360
Senator Bradford who's championing the

365
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,778
bill has offered to make changes to some

366
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,620
of the opponent's arguments but the

367
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:06,240
opponents are not willing to budge they

368
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,980
want the bill to die

369
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,139
so we're kind of there's that fight

370
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,300
happening I actually emailed was

371
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,620
emailing Senators yesterday as soon as I

372
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:15,659
leave from here I'm going to make a few

373
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,220
phone calls as well because there is a

374
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:18,659
chance the bill gets heard on Monday

375
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,720
because you know things in Sacramento

376
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:23,819
are really last minute things will pop

377
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,459
up and next thing you know your bill is

378
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:31,199
being heard in 24 48 hours and you gotta

379
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:34,859
get ready yeah all hands on deck yeah so

380
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,958
you think cannabis needs a larger Unity

381
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,778
as far as the legal business and the

382
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,419
lobbying situation absolutely yes uh

383
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:44,578
well you know the industry is divided in

384
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,139
some way because we have the cultivators

385
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:47,458
we have the Distributors and we have the

386
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,278
retailers

387
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:52,379
um so I think there are areas where

388
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:55,139
there's different interests right so

389
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:57,480
that divide is there there are areas

390
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,879
where we have the same interest and the

391
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,000
industry can come together but it's

392
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:05,279
really uh Capital right you need the

393
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,259
money to organize you need the money for

394
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,660
the professionals uh you need the money

395
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:13,379
for the attorneys to review these bills

396
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,360
you need the money for people to be on

397
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,959
the ground in Sacramento monitoring

398
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,958
these things so it's all uh it takes

399
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,039
bodies and it takes effort and it all

400
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:30,380
costs the money right yeah you showed me

401
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:33,839
an excise tax uh little diagram

402
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:36,419
do you want to explain that or yeah I

403
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,058
think you posted about it I did uh Cal

404
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:41,340
normal actually did a a nice study and

405
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:45,058
they compared all the different taxes

406
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:46,439
for other Industries and beerus taxed at

407
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:48,119
a different rate which is some of the

408
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,259
lowest rates because it's a lower priced

409
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:54,779
item then it's wine and then it's hard

410
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,660
liquor and then it's tobacco I think

411
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,678
where like a hundred times more than

412
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,380
beer

413
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:05,519
right it was about 20 times more than

414
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,380
Wine uh 15 times more than alcohol and

415
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,918
like 10 times more than tobacco yeah

416
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,140
right so the cigarette is 14 cents and a

417
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,240
joint a program joint half a gram joint

418
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,360
a dollar ten a dollar ten so you're

419
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,240
paying about uh 10 times more tax on a

420
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,759
half a gram joint than you are on a

421
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,000
cigarette in California

422
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:30,058
wow and who is there any way to change

423
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,619
that well that's what the uh industry is

424
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,500
trying to push for now obviously

425
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:37,079
consumers have a say I think people

426
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,700
really underestimate the power they have

427
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,259
as a constituent

428
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,538
um and they think oh they can't make an

429
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,700
effect but uh if there's an issue that

430
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:47,519
is affecting you and you call your

431
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,580
Senators they are obligated to take your

432
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,558
call they are obligated to respond to

433
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:54,779
your emails that's what they are they

434
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,599
are here to serve the public and I get

435
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:59,759
people underestimate the power that they

436
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,579
have sometimes and I can tell you from

437
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,038
experience uh senators and and

438
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:07,500
politicians they have a lot going on

439
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,980
right you're just one issue

440
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,079
um so if they can tackle an issue and

441
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,360
not have a bunch of complaints from

442
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,519
constituents they're gonna do it yeah

443
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,359
right and if it makes sense they're

444
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,519
gonna do it so I think the consumers are

445
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:27,240
another piece of this right it's like if

446
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,400
you're consumer the average smoker is

447
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,500
probably spending fifteen hundred to two

448
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,519
thousand dollars a year on cannabis

449
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:38,700
40 of that is going to the state right

450
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,558
right eight hundred dollars of your

451
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,298
money that it's going to be back in your

452
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,918
pocket it's not going to go back to the

453
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:47,038
retailer because that money never hits

454
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,740
our books right right when we report our

455
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:52,379
taxes to the IRS

456
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,660
um that money is not our money it never

457
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,240
hits our books so if a company says they

458
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,419
did a million dollars in Revenue really

459
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,160
they brought in 1.4 and 400 000 of that

460
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,100
went to the state of California and the

461
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,700
city that they're operating in so it's

462
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:10,259
really uh it's not our money it's their

463
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,380
money that's going to the state so they

464
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:15,660
have every right to voice their concern

465
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,840
is there any other product that

466
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,240
consumers buy that's taxed so high no

467
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,220
well you saw the yeah you saw the

468
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,558
breakdown there is no other consumer

469
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,019
product uh kind of ridiculous being

470
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,298
taxed at that rate

471
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,519
so

472
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:35,700
there's another uh little government

473
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:38,700
um bit of bureaucracy the metric system

474
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,679
I know Growers have to use the metric

475
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,960
system right yeah and I was wondering if

476
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,160
you could explain this uh tracking

477
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,500
program

478
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,380
and wondering if

479
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,679
you have alternate ideas or proposals

480
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:56,640
that might lessen the onerous burden of

481
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,200
the Metro System scrap it enough

482
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,299
um well look it's it's something that

483
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,740
the industry has

484
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:04,918
uh

485
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,319
taken on it's required by the federal

486
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,980
government for states to track the

487
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:14,279
Cannabis from plant to end product so

488
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,440
it's here it's not going anywhere for a

489
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,839
while some other states have taken other

490
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,380
approaches which I think is more

491
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:25,619
industry friendly the California bill or

492
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:32,220
law prop 64 requires

493
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:35,099
that the RFID tags are state issued uh

494
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,720
some states FID yes those are the am I

495
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,359
saying it wrong no that's the way

496
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,279
they're Tagged so it's the tag it has a

497
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:47,399
scanner in it yeah um very uh expensive

498
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,500
um because each plan has a tag right

499
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,000
it's got a strip in it's a it's a ID

500
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,220
scanner it's got a little strip in it so

501
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,679
that uh when the state comes in they can

502
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,798
scan and see how many of those are in

503
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,840
the room right so they they're used in

504
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,359
all type of Industries we have to

505
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,119
purchase them from metric and it's baked

506
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,939
into our licensing cost if I tell you

507
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:12,178
what we pay for licensing people are

508
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:15,179
astonished where our company's paying a

509
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,340
closely up to it's about two hundred

510
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,600
thousand dollars a year for licensing

511
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,298
fees

512
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,879
because most of that money is going into

513
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:26,038
these RFID tags the tags are very

514
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,320
expensive is that a City license or a

515
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,179
state uh State Licensing state license

516
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,158
so

517
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:34,140
for cultivation and Retail and all sorts

518
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,419
of different license types that we have

519
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,280
so

520
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,679
we have to purchase these tags from

521
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,720
metric metric builds the state and the

522
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,580
state bills us

523
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,100
there are other states that allow

524
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:49,439
cultivators to purchase their own RFID

525
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:51,599
tags so they buy them directly from

526
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,038
manufacturers and they're substantially

527
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,619
cheaper

528
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:58,440
so that's one thing I think the industry

529
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:00,239
is pushing for that hey can we fix this

530
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,580
that we don't have to buy these tags for

531
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,339
metric and find cheaper alternatives

532
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:07,319
obviously metric doesn't like that idea

533
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:09,359
and I don't know if the state

534
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,240
I see the state's point

535
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:15,678
right they want to be in control of the

536
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,900
situation better but I don't think it's

537
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,880
financially feasible to sustain this

538
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,000
many tags that we're paying for because

539
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,640
it's tens of thousands of tags that are

540
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,119
adding up the larger cultivator it's

541
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,000
hundreds of thousands of tags so we have

542
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,759
the economics behind it we have the

543
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,558
environmental side of it this plastic

544
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,200
that we're wasting each one is plastic

545
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,460
oh yeah yeah it's full of plastic it's a

546
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,980
thick plastic

547
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,140
so there's that side of it there's the

548
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,798
cost side of it there's the actual labor

549
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:52,259
behind tagging all these plants where I

550
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:55,139
think there's simpler ways to track how

551
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:56,579
many plants are in a room digitally and

552
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,320
not necessarily have to have his

553
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:00,359
physical tag

554
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,279
that I don't you know that most people

555
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:05,639
are like I think there's better ways to

556
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:08,579
do this and I I don't want to knock

557
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,360
what the state has built because at the

558
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,418
time

559
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:15,178
for at the speed in the way the program

560
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,980
has been rolled out it was what was in

561
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:19,200
front of them and they made it this

562
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,058
decision that they had to make but I

563
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,058
think now is the time I think with

564
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:25,798
enough years under our belt just like

565
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:27,240
all the Cannabis businesses have to look

566
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,579
internally and

567
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,980
reconfigure their business I think the

568
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:35,279
state has to do the same right we've

569
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,079
been at this for five years already we

570
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,899
have a lot of data we know what's

571
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,339
working we have to know what's not

572
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,220
working and we have to make those

573
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:46,980
changes so can there be a lot of changes

574
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,440
to the metric system uh absolutely

575
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,759
metric is a company right metric is a

576
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,679
third party company they have the

577
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,839
software is that what it is they have

578
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,059
the software they have the contract with

579
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:00,599
the state right so why should they also

580
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:02,579
have the plastic business yeah so and

581
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,619
purchase through them I've heard some

582
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,259
studies where it's about 10 or I've

583
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:09,359
heard some operators say that it's about

584
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,519
10 times the cost of what you would be

585
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,339
able to buy it on the free market the

586
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,980
tags the tags yeah correct then the big

587
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:19,319
portion of the

588
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,298
licensing fees go to the tags so I think

589
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,038
that is that's ridiculous that's an

590
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:26,220
issue yeah that I think the industry

591
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,440
wants to tackle here pretty soon

592
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,079
and if uh if enough people get together

593
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,360
and it's really the state because they

594
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:36,418
are a vendor to the state right right

595
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,399
they're not our vendor they are a vendor

596
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:41,520
to the state I think the state has to

597
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,400
really uh re-evaluate that contract with

598
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,319
metric and how we can save some costs

599
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,320
for The Operators and save some costs

600
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,460
for the industry as a whole

601
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:55,558
and maybe change it from plastic to

602
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:59,579
biodegradable paper maybe right or one

603
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:02,339
tag per room one tag per tray uh lower

604
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:04,619
that uh that footprint right the number

605
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:06,839
is the number yeah right uh when the

606
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:09,239
state walks in and you have uh 200

607
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,158
plants registered in a room and there's

608
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,000
it's not that difficult to count 200

609
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:17,940
plants or if there's a thousand uh

610
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,798
I can see the thought process behind it

611
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,960
maybe you're going to a two Acre Farm

612
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:24,658
that has 10 000 plants and you don't

613
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,980
want Regulators in there tag counting 10

614
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:32,100
000 plants but there has to be a better

615
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,839
alternative uh to maybe counting the

616
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,119
rows or Counting

617
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,740
one tag and like having that tag

618
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,139
represent

619
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,659
a certain amount of plants right right

620
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:45,480
there has to be better solution I think

621
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:47,340
the industry can come up with there's AI

622
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,220
there's all type of different technology

623
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:53,158
that can be looked at that's gonna save

624
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:56,038
the industry money and not be such a

625
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:58,620
environmental waste as well

626
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:00,119
now I know you're you said you're on the

627
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,459
uh United cannabis Business

628
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,439
association's board what is the United

629
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,960
cannabis Business Association up to

630
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,960
lately and what are the like long-term

631
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,538
and short-term goals well we have uh

632
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,480
been together as a group as a trade

633
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:17,720
Association for

634
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,339
seven years now so we've definitely

635
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,919
we've done a lot I think for the budget

636
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:24,359
that we have the group is putting in a

637
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,220
lot of uh

638
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,519
the executive board puts in a lot of

639
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,980
their time it's just mainly La based

640
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,139
um no it's Statewide oh it is yes we

641
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,778
have a coalition between Long Beach

642
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:41,100
dispensary Santa Ana the Coachella

643
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:44,419
Valley in San Francisco so we all have

644
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:48,119
different members from all those local

645
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:50,278
organizations that participate in the uh

646
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,678
State Legislative committee so the the

647
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:55,919
it started off as a local La based

648
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,980
organization that put together and

649
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,460
organized retailers to get the measure

650
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,440
and pass which is the law that Rick uh

651
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,000
started the licensing process for

652
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,519
cannabis retail in the city of Los

653
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,220
Angeles for adult use and then we've

654
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:13,918
kind of just expanded into the state and

655
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,620
you know we are

656
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,559
I will go out on the limb and say the

657
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:22,199
leading cannabis trade Association in

658
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:24,720
California and I I would argue that with

659
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,700
any other Association

660
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,919

00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,679
desperately needs

680
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,558
regulatory

681
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:23,159
watering down if that's a word oh yeah

682
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:26,519
right the regulations yeah watered down

683
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:29,940
substantially and we need some fixes so

684
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,398
that this industry can uh get out of

685
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,080
this uh hole it's in right now and you

686
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,759
know I think I sent you the article

687
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,220
about all the taxes that have not been

688
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:42,240
paid there's about a half a billion

689
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:45,000
dollars in unpaid taxes the industry is

690
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,480
you know the business operators are

691
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,038
collapsing yeah the consumer side

692
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,440
thriving consumers are getting to get

693
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,599
the best of the best product they're not

694
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,460
going to get better product than in

695
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,918
California anywhere else in the world

696
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,899
I've said this uh previously and I'll

697
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,880
say it again you are not going to get a

698
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:05,639
better product anywhere in the world

699
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,299
than California as a consumer business

700
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,799
side businesses are collapsing and the

701
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:12,418
small businesses are getting the worst

702
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,339
end of the stick

703
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:17,220
small cultivators are getting worse than

704
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:20,220
the stick uh small retailers are getting

705
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,740
the worst end of the stick so we need a

706
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,319
lot of fixes and

707
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,019
um you know someone has to do it and for

708
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,599
me I made the decision to do it because

709
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,579
I enjoy the industry and I'm going to

710
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,579
keep doing it until I don't enjoy it

711
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:37,939
anymore so yeah that's that's my side of

712
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:39,778
it and do you guys

713
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,278
collaborate with other business

714
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:43,679
associations cannabis business

715
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,538
associations right so all the other

716
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,519
cities that I told you about they all

717
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:50,278
have their local Association so it's the

718
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,679
Coachella Valley

719
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:55,859
cannabis Network Alliance there's the

720
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,259
Long Beach Business Long Beach cannabis

721
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:01,918
Business Association there's the Sanford

722
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:05,759
San Francisco there's the Santa Ana and

723
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,559
they all participate but ucba uh kind of

724
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,158
leads the way because we have the the

725
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:13,798
experience in in Sacramento yeah yeah I

726
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,440
think I I interviewed the uh Long Beach

727
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:18,480
cannabis Business Association guy can't

728
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,480
remember his name right now um I think

729
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,860
Adam Adam yeah he's a great guy he's

730
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,620
part of the legislative committee as

731
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:28,639
well yeah that's cool

732
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:32,759
we were talking about assembly bill

733
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:36,480
11-11 yes and what that would that was

734
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:39,000
to another bill establishment uh farmers

735
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,339
markets for cannabis yes can we talk

736
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,278
about that a little bit and yeah this is

737
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:47,099
this bill is back again I think they've

738
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:52,140
the author has made three attempts in

739
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:55,439
the last five years and you know I

740
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:59,820
as a retailer we have a problem with the

741
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,558
bill because it's very vague on a lot of

742
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:04,859
the language as far as local control

743
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:07,200
goes and how these events are going to

744
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:10,740
be coordinated licensed tracked

745
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,200
monitored and as a retailer

746
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,620
we think it's a little unfair for

747
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,899
cultivators to be allowed to come into

748
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:21,298
municipalities without a clear

749
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:23,639
definition of how they're going to be

750
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:28,759
licensed and authorized to have an event

751
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,759
32 times a year per license type

752
00:32:29,538 --> 00:32:34,558
per license type

753
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,778
the average cultivator probably has two

754
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,418
or three licenses on their premise some

755
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:42,240
have one but some have two three and

756
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,940
some bigger producers have multiple so

757
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,759
that part of the bill obviously needs

758
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,340
some fixes I don't think the retailers

759
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,398
or ucba or myself are against the

760
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:54,778
farmer's market concept uh right if it's

761
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:57,000
really the

762
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:59,460
the language behind the bill and how the

763
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,519
bill is going to actually be implemented

764
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,679
or enforced because we have laws on the

765
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,918
books now that are absolutely not being

766
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:11,399
enforced so another law on the bill

767
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,320
that's not going to enforce or be

768
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:14,639
overseen and then what does that mean

769
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,798
for the Department of Consumer

770
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,960
Department of cannabis control how are

771
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:20,278
they going to oversee these events so

772
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,919
there's definitely a lot of issues with

773
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:24,419
the bill and the authors do not want to

774
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,820
amend the bill

775
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:29,038
so we have no choice but to oppose the

776
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:32,158
bill and we've been fighting very hard

777
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,919
against it who are the authors

778
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,080
um so it's probably a group of

779
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:41,278
cultivators a lot of people are not very

780
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:42,839
transparent in Sacramento ucba always uh

781
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,480
puts their name behind whatever Bill

782
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,579
they're supporting or opposing I don't

783
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,278
have the Senator's name off the top of

784
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:51,720
my head uh it's the cell I don't have

785
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,940
the assemblyman's name off the top of my

786
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,399
head but it's cultivators whether it's

787
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,860
large cultivators or small I'd want to

788
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,979
bet it's large cultivators and I want to

789
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:04,859
bet it's uh event companies right they

790
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,319
want to be able to host these events and

791
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:09,779
not go be in the Cannabis industry but

792
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,940
not go through the

793
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,619
compliance and the regulatory process

794
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,338
that the Cannabis industry has to go to

795
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:20,220
so for us that's an unfair Advantage I

796
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:23,338
have to go through regulatory processes

797
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:25,799
to retail in the city of Los Angeles

798
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:27,858
and now cultivators are going to be

799
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,500
allowed to partner with event

800
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:35,039
companies to host farmers markets sell

801
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,980
direct consumers in any municipality and

802
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,378
and from any place in the state

803
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,219
so that's the vagueness of the bill

804
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,199
right

805
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:46,138
if you look at the face of the bill it

806
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,598
says the locals have uh control so local

807
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,300
authorities have control over events

808
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,580
already on the books right but if you're

809
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,339
in the event industry you know that

810
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:57,960
process very well yeah it's not very

811
00:34:56,338 --> 00:35:01,199
difficult to throw an event

812
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,639
in Los Angeles or in most counties or

813
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,659
most cities

814
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,500
um

815
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:09,899
how that affects cannabis regulatory

816
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,699
it's very vague again right like we have

817
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,280
to have cameras we have the track and

818
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:16,379
Trace system what it's ultimately doing

819
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,700
is allowing cultivators to be part-time

820
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,220
retailers

821
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,779
which is not the intent of the law we

822
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:23,759
created a system

823
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,440
with cultivators Distributors and

824
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,440
retailers for a reason that's what the

825
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,838
voters voted for why because it creates

826
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,358
checks and balances now can a person

827
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:36,000
dabble into all sides of the industry

828
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,139
absolutely it allows for that but you

829
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,838
have to go through the regulatory

830
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:42,598
process not this bill that's going to

831
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:46,078
create this pop-up scenario in an

832
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,900
industry that's already struggling with

833
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,260
the illicit Market thriving and we felt

834
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,880
like there isn't enough language in the

835
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,099
bill

836
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,800
um

837
00:35:55,099 --> 00:36:01,260
for the regulatory people or for

838
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,500
Regulators to have a clear path to

839
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,240
regulating these uh events and the

840
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,099
second argument is

841
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,539
there's events like that happening right

842
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,539
now

843
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:15,239
the law allows for it it just has to go

844
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:16,559
through retailers because they're the

845
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,719
only one allowed to sell to end

846
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,400
consumers that's the intent of the law

847
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,059
so

848
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,099
um

849
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,400
for cultivators to say oh we don't have

850
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:28,680
access to real customers we're the

851
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,039
retailers of The Gatekeepers is not true

852
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:34,500
events happen now there was an event in

853
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,880
Los Angeles uh two weeks ago the

854
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,219
Olympics

855
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,320
consumers were there retailers were

856
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:42,239
there Brands were there

857
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,960
the track and Trace has to go through a

858
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:48,779
retail retailer so that the the state

859
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:52,079
has a way of tracking this product right

860
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:55,859
so the arguments

861
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:59,099
for the bill are just not true at least

862
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:01,559
in in our opinion right so we will keep

863
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,720
fighting the bill and we'll see how that

864
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,539
lands to make it more friendly for a

865
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:08,939
small time Farmers absolutely right

866
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:10,739
that's the intention out of it of the

867
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,900
further right it's really it's it's

868
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:15,179
clarification it's not enough opposing

869
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:18,180
the bill but it's the argument for the

870
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:20,159
bill is is kind of fishy right kind of

871
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:22,500
like the Trojan Horse what's really

872
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,420
behind this bill right are we going to

873
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,880
be having these Mass ticketed events

874
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,240
that uh these live Nations and these big

875
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,400
uh event companies are going to just

876
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,039
capitalize on and the farmer is going to

877
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,320
just be there pay to be there and give

878
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,358
away cannabis or whatever this the

879
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,300
arrangement is right it's yeah

880
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,578
I don't think the uh

881
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,920
the bill is not clear enough and the

882
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:50,160
authors are not willing to clarify their

883
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,200
position so the ucba and a lot of the

884
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,199
retailers have taken an opposing

885
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:57,899
position on the bill yeah well I don't

886
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,879
see why it has to be an event I mean

887
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,039
regular farmers markets around the

888
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,660
streets right on a Sunday afternoon or

889
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:05,639
whatever right and obviously cannabis

890
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:08,338
can't be on the streets there is a

891
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:11,279
camera requirements really fast right so

892
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:14,578
it has to be so we're required to keep

893
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,980
90 days records of all the transactions

894
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,500
um so when we submit for our license all

895
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,900
the premise diagrams identify all the

896
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,838
cameras and we go through a high level

897
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,460
of scrutiny and that's the vagueness in

898
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:28,980
this bill

899
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,500
um so how is an event going to hold 90

900
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,599
days records of cameras how are they

901
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,400
going to like there's nothing in the

902
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,160
bill about any of this accountability

903
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,139
that the retailers have to go through

904
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,480
yeah well

905
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:44,460
hope we get that straight are you going

906
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,358
to call your local assemblyman to oppose

907
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,358
the bill absolutely

908
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:56,460
I know you grow your own weed but what

909
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,700
do you look for in other Growers to get

910
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:02,820
their weed on your shelves well uh it's

911
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:03,659
quality Quality quality I think that's

912
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,760
um

913
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:07,440
what we hold ourselves true to and

914
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,420
that's what our customers know us for

915
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,119
that's why we have customers that have

916
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,400
been coming to our stores for over 10

917
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,260
years 12 years some of us some of our

918
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,380
customers we have customers that are

919
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,260
here almost every day because they know

920
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,720
um if the products on our Shelf we stand

921
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,520
behind the quality right and we're not

922
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,459
just going to bring any product that

923
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:32,280
paid us for a slotting fee or gave us

924
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:35,338
some special to put on the shelves the

925
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,500
quality matters and then as far as the

926
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:40,139
brands go when the quality is there we

927
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,579
also look for brand support right what

928
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:42,960
are they going to do to drive some of

929
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,000
their existing customers because we're

930
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,099
gonna uh

931
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,960
advertise them to our customers so

932
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:51,480
there's got to be some give and take

933
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,400
right there they have to help sell their

934
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,619
product as well and then let their

935
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,838
customers know about

936
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,358
their product being available in in our

937
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,000
store so it's definitely

938
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:06,119
a business relationship when we only

939
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,920
carry a brand but if the quality is not

940
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:10,920
there I'm sorry whatever they're

941
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,300
offering it just ends up not cutting it

942
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,480
because

943
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,060
um the consumer doesn't necessarily know

944
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,039
the brand but they know our brand right

945
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:21,900
because they drive by it every day it's

946
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,059
on their way to work it's around the

947
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,639
corner from their house it's on their

948
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:29,099
weed maps feed we're in their face and

949
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:32,519
we're the point of uh contact right

950
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:35,099
where the transaction happened so if a

951
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,420
product is bad or they have a bad

952
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,920
experience

953
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,240
they're not going to go to the brand

954
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,059
they don't know where to find the brand

955
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:46,439
they know where to find us right so as a

956
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:48,599
retailer we just can't have that as the

957
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,820
experience for our customers because we

958
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,780
highly value our customer we highly

959
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:58,800
value the lifespan of our customer right

960
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:01,380
as acquiring customers expensive so we

961
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,900
invest in keeping the customer and

962
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,640
that's that's kind of our our goal so I

963
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,280
get pitch Brands all the times even

964
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:10,259
friends like I have to just play it off

965
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,060
and be like yeah let me get a sample

966
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,119
we'll put it in front of the buyer but

967
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:18,838
the product just does not meet

968
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,059
the standard yeah and unfortunately you

969
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:23,219
know they can't be on the shelves if it

970
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:26,219
doesn't yeah

971
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:27,838
well that's good to know for uh all your

972
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:29,578
customers yeah yeah

973
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:33,000
what kind of Innovations is there like

974
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:34,800
cannabis going to be making lately so

975
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,880
we're constantly

976
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,440
looking at ways to reinvent ourselves

977
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,079
business-wise making a lot of pivots and

978
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,619
changes on the business economics of

979
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,380
things figuring out

980
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:52,920
how we're gonna play in this new climate

981
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,260
or as far as products the price per gram

982
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,119
and how that affects our cash flow so

983
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,780
the business side I'm constantly working

984
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,820
on uh ways to figure out how to adapt to

985
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,280
the market situation because the bigger

986
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,500
Market I can't control right so I have

987
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,019
to be able to control my economics and

988
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,780
how that works into the business but

989
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:15,358
products wise

990
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:18,599
we are constantly looking for different

991
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:21,358
strains to cultivate but we are making a

992
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:25,320
big transition in cultivation right now

993
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:28,460
uh we've been growing in Rockwell for 15

994
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:33,180
years and we finally made the decision

995
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:35,820
to uh transition to soil is a big change

996
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:39,179
for us thank you thank you very much we

997
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:42,900
are thank you very much we are going to

998
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:46,259
make a change uh into the way our our

999
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:48,780
plant is grown the size of the plant

1000
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,579
um will be bigger right so we are what

1001
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,780
size bags are you going to use we are

1002
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:54,780
using we're going to be growing in five

1003
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:57,000
gallon so that is big change from where

1004
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,099
we're at the labor side of it changes a

1005
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,800
little bit it's a lot more labor to go

1006
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:04,140
in yeah but a little bit less labor

1007
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,200
throughout the process as far as the

1008
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:08,879
watering goes so we're gonna make we're

1009
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,019
making those changes now we actually

1010
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,539
have about

1011
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:14,338
30 percent of the rooms transitioned and

1012
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:16,679
as they come down we're making the

1013
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:19,019
change so there has to be some changes

1014
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:22,259
made to the room's environment right so

1015
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:25,259
we're uh redesigning our trays we're

1016
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:28,140
redesigning our irrigation system uh to

1017
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,020
fit this new change and will the soil be

1018
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:34,618
like living soil and with like

1019
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:37,619
right so it is a we're we're working

1020
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:40,400
with uh Mother's Finest soil it is one

1021
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:44,880
of the top quality soils on the market

1022
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,400
organic it is organic soil yes and um so

1023
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,160
managing the soil yeah right it's a lot

1024
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,099
of soil

1025
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:55,739
environment right so uh working with the

1026
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:57,838
suppliers securing that

1027
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:59,219
um and having the soil delivered so it's

1028
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:03,000
not sitting around

1029
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:05,279
so it's a lot it's different planning so

1030
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,338
we're making those changes I'm already

1031
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,819
loving when I walk into the rooms the

1032
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:14,338
plants are just happier you already have

1033
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,659
soil going on yes so we have 30 of the

1034
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:17,940
rooms have already been transitioned oh

1035
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:20,159
wow so no I think we'll have to come

1036
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,599
down and do a little uh episode I'm

1037
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,639
gonna I'm gonna take some videos and

1038
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,700
I'll post and I'll tag you so okay yeah

1039
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:29,639
but uh repost on your page but uh we

1040
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:31,919
have a plants and veg and soil already

1041
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:34,199
we have rooms that have already flipped

1042
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,838
to flower and soil I think our first

1043
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:40,199
rooms uh in week one right now in soil

1044
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:42,659
oh wow um so it's definitely a different

1045
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:45,299
feel in the room you can just feel it

1046
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:46,739
feels different right the humidity is a

1047
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,440
little different the temperatures are a

1048
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:52,439
little different yeah the the height of

1049
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,179
the plant is completely different it's

1050
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,659
going to be about two feet taller and

1051
00:44:54,179 --> 00:45:00,899
wider and wider correct so a lot of

1052
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:03,299
changes on that side so how much yield

1053
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:07,858
difference will there be per plant you

1054
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:10,380
think we're anticipating a 30 to 40

1055
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:12,900
percent increase yeah um we've kept all

1056
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:16,200
our genetics so we'll continue to have

1057
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:19,680
our uh Bank of of genetics that we're

1058
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:23,098
cultivating and hopefully expand uh into

1059
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:25,019
that kind of a library of strains we

1060
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:27,059
have a lot of the classic stuff so we're

1061
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:28,920
very excited to see how our existing

1062
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:31,139
strains are going to come out out in the

1063
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,119
soil because it is going to be different

1064
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:35,699
right it's like our customers are going

1065
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,680
to see the similarities but they're also

1066
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:40,019
going to be they're also going to notice

1067
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,699
the the differences right yeah so it's I

1068
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:43,318
think you might have a a more full

1069
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:45,480
flavor profile

1070
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:47,639
yes and I think the flavor is going to

1071
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,380
be better the bud structure is going to

1072
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:51,239
be better the yields are going to be

1073
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,420
better which is good for the economics

1074
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:57,539
of for our business and the lifespan of

1075
00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:00,180
of the company yeah right now with the

1076
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:02,759
price compression we need to have bigger

1077
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:05,519
yields and the process is a little

1078
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,440
longer so the economics is different

1079
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,599
right because we're going Hydro you can

1080
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,059
you go faster yeah so you're going

1081
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,519
faster so the making the plants a little

1082
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:17,039
taller takes a little bit more time but

1083
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,420
we're adding veg space so we're going to

1084
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:22,619
substitute

1085
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:24,659
that time with more space so we'll be

1086
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:27,300
able to stagger things out and not miss

1087
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:30,598
a harvest yeah so it's just we're just

1088
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:32,160
replanting everything so it we're we're

1089
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,318
planning for the better

1090
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,519
that's cool and you talked about new

1091
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,519
lights

1092
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,920
yeah yeah so we're used to use gavita

1093
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:43,440
right so we

1094
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,500
we've transitioned into the gavita LEDs

1095
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,019
for the last year and a half two years I

1096
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,219
think we've been on it but we were HPS

1097
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:54,239
and veg

1098
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:58,199
and now we're doing LED in uh veg as

1099
00:46:54,239 --> 00:47:00,118
well yeah so we're doing LED and veg

1100
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:02,939
we'll be able to lower the lights a lot

1101
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:06,358
more we have more veg space now we're

1102
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:09,300
maximizing our trays before we had some

1103
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:11,039
we had some Dead Space because of the

1104
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:14,220
type of trays we were using so now we've

1105
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:16,440
we're putting in custom trays to

1106
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:18,539
maximize every foot and still have the

1107
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,780
clearance needed for the fire department

1108
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:23,960
yeah yeah so so making a lot of changes

1109
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,599
working a lot of hours

1110
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:31,380
I told my wife and my family I'm like

1111
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,300
for the next like 90 days dad is not Dad

1112
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,099
husband is not going to be husband right

1113
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,700
we're going to be we're gonna be a

1114
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:41,160
little uh a little uh preoccupied with

1115
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:43,199
the with another family we have our

1116
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:45,559
family of plants well

1117
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,419
if you need help let me know I will

1118
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:50,639
speaking of genetics let's talk about

1119
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,460
your genetics I know you have a lot of

1120
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:56,639
Legacy strains and a lot of them I know

1121
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,139
you just came up with the the new Bubba

1122
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,639
the diagonal Bubba I don't know why it's

1123
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:01,920
called diagonal but the Bubba is

1124
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:06,838
freaking awesome yeah it's it's a Bubba

1125
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:10,619
crossed with the OG so it's uh

1126
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:12,599
similar to our La con but different like

1127
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,220
we still have the LA con we have the

1128
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,260
genetics it's not in production right

1129
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:18,078
now so we kind of phase it in and out

1130
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,119
depending on the demand

1131
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:24,060
but we have the bubble diagonal we have

1132
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:27,838
a a biscotti mince

1133
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:31,619
which is like a cushman's kind of hybrid

1134
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:34,679
um amazing not amazing yeah it sold out

1135
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:36,660
really fast we had done one row I think

1136
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:39,960
it was a small batch under like around

1137
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:42,239
10 pounds and flew off the shelf but we

1138
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,400
got that in rotation we're bringing Sour

1139
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,259
Diesel back I have a sour coming back

1140
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,000
you know we had sour in production for a

1141
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:51,119
minute so we have a lot of the OG

1142
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,358
strands we have the real Sour Diesel and

1143
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,640
it is a difficult plant to cultivate the

1144
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:59,338
yields are not that great that's why the

1145
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,838
industry doesn't produce it right and

1146
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:03,119
you're not going to see it on shelves

1147
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:05,219
obviously the it's a growing period is

1148
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,400
longer as well is it

1149
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:10,618
it it could go a little longer sativas

1150
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,539
are actually don't go

1151
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:16,920
I'm going to phrase that sativas don't

1152
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:19,079
go as long but the plant is really tall

1153
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,300
so it's hard to grow with other strains

1154
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,140
right because they just overpower the

1155
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,460
room

1156
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,259
so

1157
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,639
when you're growing a lot of strains in

1158
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,040
a room

1159
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,318
it doesn't it does an injustice to your

1160
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:36,300
other strains it kind of like dominates

1161
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:39,300
it so we figured out a way to kind of

1162
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,099
maintain that a little bit so we have

1163
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,160
one coming down now that's still in the

1164
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:45,960
in the hydro in the grow dance so we

1165
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:49,980
plan on bringing that back in the soil

1166
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:52,800
as as well we have uh the original ogs

1167
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,900
we have the Louie the fires the Fire OG

1168
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,720
which is like uh comes from the Louis

1169
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,818
strain right and which I crossed I think

1170
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:02,419
we have some land race afghanity to come

1171
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:02,420
up with my

1172
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:06,659
yeah yeah I remember we're gonna smoke

1173
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:09,719
right after this

1174
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:12,598
yes I will be I will be

1175
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:14,279
I saved myself for it yeah you'll be

1176
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,160
interested in that but we're definitely

1177
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,200
gonna we we're keeping a library of

1178
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:21,480
strains where the industry right now is

1179
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:24,838
pivoting towards the Za the candy

1180
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,179
strains which it is the hype now and

1181
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:29,519
we're growing a Lemon Cherry gelato as

1182
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:32,159
well right because it is a popular

1183
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:35,519
strain now consumers want it so yeah

1184
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:37,559
gelato also we have a gelato we have a

1185
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,480
run spoke this one is a specific Lemon

1186
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,880
Cherry gelato you know where we're

1187
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,818
always uh trading strains with friends

1188
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:47,039
yeah and that's kind of there's a few we

1189
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:48,779
won't trade but most were open to

1190
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,599
trading with most of our friends I need

1191
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:53,040
a few more clones yeah yeah I've made a

1192
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,838
few exceptions with you and I've given

1193
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,358
you giving you a few of the genetics on

1194
00:50:54,838 --> 00:51:00,779
The Limited list uh-huh

1195
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:03,900
um and I thank you you mentioned uh the

1196
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:06,540
possibility of growing from seed uh or

1197
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,880
is that true well some of our genetics

1198
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:10,318
are from seed right so we'll and then

1199
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,358
they'll come across from seed and then

1200
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:15,119
we'll we'll take clothes right through

1201
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,818
those exactly right so uh the the

1202
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,460
library of strings have been

1203
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:22,500
accumulated throughout the years from

1204
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,559
seeds different clones from different

1205
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,940
friends in the industry and then you

1206
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:28,019
know it's interesting because you can

1207
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,480
take

1208
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:34,019
you can take the same

1209
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,119
strain from the same mom and grow it in

1210
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:38,579
different environments and it's going to

1211
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,900
come out different right yeah so it's

1212
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:42,240
really uh

1213
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:45,960
you know your environment does

1214
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:48,118
determine who you are oh yeah yeah so

1215
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,358
that's the same for the plants your

1216
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:54,119
environment is who you are right it's a

1217
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:57,960
byproduct of you are a byproduct of your

1218
00:51:54,119 --> 00:52:00,358
environment so it'll it's interesting to

1219
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,460
see the same strain from your friend or

1220
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:04,139
uh someone else that was grown and

1221
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,780
you've seen the end product and then you

1222
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:09,480
see it grown in your facility and the

1223
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,800
end product is completely different and

1224
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,219
we actually have two cultivation

1225
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,380
facilities and we see a difference from

1226
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:18,899
facility to facility on the same stream

1227
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:22,140
right we see a difference from room to

1228
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:24,358
room with the same strain right just the

1229
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,699
measurements of some ways the rooms were

1230
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:30,119
laid out because of just the physical

1231
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:32,279
space yeah airflow and whatnot right

1232
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,260
humidity or it could be

1233
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,240
a couple of feet of difference it could

1234
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,740
be the way the duck like it's the

1235
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,439
environment right here it's the

1236
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:43,019
environment you created so it makes a

1237
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,059
difference on how the uh the plant is

1238
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:47,759
grown

1239
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:49,200
or or the end product yeah

1240
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,880
well that's cool

1241
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,639
where do you see the Cannabis industry

1242
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,338
in five years

1243
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:58,920
look out that one man what is that the

1244
00:52:56,338 --> 00:53:00,179
industry in five years where would you

1245
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,200
like it to be and where do you think

1246
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:03,419
it's going

1247
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:06,118
the industry

1248
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:08,639
as a whole it's got One Direction you

1249
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:12,480
know up it has a lot of growth that is

1250
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:18,179
still needed we are an infant right yeah

1251
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:21,480
as far as uh size and Innovation there's

1252
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:25,858
still a lot to go have we accelerated

1253
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:29,639
a lot yes the cultivation extraction

1254
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:31,799
manufacturing of cannabis had a big

1255
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:35,098
infusion of capital and it accelerated

1256
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:39,119
very fast it definitely has a lot more

1257
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:41,880
to go and I think as agriculture

1258
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,559
is expanding and technology is and

1259
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,140
agriculture

1260
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,839
coming together and incredible things

1261
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:50,400
are happening uh the same is expected in

1262
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:54,358
cannabis

1263
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,338
um as far as the business side of it uh

1264
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:57,318
there'll be more price compression to

1265
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:59,639
come

1266
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:02,338
there'll be and what do you mean by

1267
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:05,279
Price compression the price of the

1268
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:07,139
Cannabis is going to come down right

1269
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,680
um the price per gram will be cheaper

1270
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:12,420
cannabis will be commoditized uh infused

1271
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:14,759
products will absolutely the crude oil

1272
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,659
will become commoditized because alcohol

1273
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,980
is alcohol right

1274
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:22,318
it's uh it's going to have its lower end

1275
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,719
it's going to have its higher end the

1276
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:27,838
accordion stretch as I call it is going

1277
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:31,318
to widen there'll be a lot more products

1278
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:35,159
under ten dollars and

1279
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:37,159
more products over 60 70 80 hundred

1280
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:40,739
dollars right so we're gonna have this

1281
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:43,858
uh Big Stretch between a gap in in

1282
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:45,959
pricing right 80 of the market will be

1283
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:47,639
under ten dollars and I promise you this

1284
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,380
and there will be indoor under ten

1285
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:51,838
dollars as well we're talking eighths

1286
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:54,358
for ten dollars yeah yeah I mean it's on

1287
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:56,940
our shelves now yeah we have we have

1288
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:58,799
eight dollar eights right are these

1289
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,300
right now outdoor it's outdoor outdoor

1290
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,920
Greenhouse well you know there's great

1291
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,619
outdoor weed that people absolutely

1292
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,300
absolutely and it's undervalued

1293
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:08,640
um and that product's only going to get

1294
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,359
better yeah uh with with more technology

1295
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:15,058
but there is the indoor Boutique craft

1296
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:17,519
cannabis and what we're seeing is if

1297
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:19,980
it's really good it's just gonna go for

1298
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:21,900
more though obviously there's branding

1299
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,960
and packaging and there's a whole

1300
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:27,420
lifestyle behind the Cannabis Brands and

1301
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,000
a few brands are capitalizing on that

1302
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:33,000
right now and that's going to continue

1303
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,800
right that's gonna happen branding

1304
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,960
marketing

1305
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,380
that's a whole

1306
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,659
another Beast right yeah uh there are

1307
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,160
experts in marketing there are experts

1308
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:46,199
in branding and then there are people

1309
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,659
who brand themselves incredibly well

1310
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:50,338
that's going to continue to happen and

1311
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:53,639
they're going to bring

1312
00:55:50,338 --> 00:55:55,799
that value to their product will that be

1313
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:58,500
a majority of the products sold

1314
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,000
absolutely not right I would say it's

1315
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,960
going to be about five percent of the

1316
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,039
products sold it'll probably

1317
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:10,559
uh be 20 of the revenue but

1318
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,119
the bulk of the product consumed in the

1319
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,599
next five years will be under ten

1320
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:17,579
dollars yeah and

1321
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:18,359
what outdoor Farms do you carry right

1322
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:20,760
now

1323
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:22,679
oh let's get let's get somebody else

1324
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,720
from the team to kind of uh put that out

1325
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:26,879
there but no I I know some of the brands

1326
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:29,039
we're we work with some smaller Farmers

1327
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,900
actually who some of our cheapest states

1328
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:33,000
are smaller Farmers they're Brands not

1329
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,940
too many people know about but we know

1330
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,039
the farm family owned a few of the barns

1331
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:41,280
we have a brand tipsy

1332
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:43,980
husband wife son yeah they package they

1333
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,380
distribute they grow right and they have

1334
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,059
an affordable product and we love

1335
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,599
supporting them and we love them on the

1336
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:53,339
shelves and our customers love the 8.8

1337
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,380
um we carry

1338
00:56:53,338 --> 00:56:57,000
you know the a lot of the companies from

1339
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,858
the Central Coast

1340
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,838
um

1341
00:56:57,858 --> 00:57:02,519
well Mendocino unfortunately the

1342
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:04,259
Northern California brands are

1343
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,900
struggling right now yeah they're having

1344
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:09,900
a hard time coming to Market

1345
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:12,180
um I think the distance has a little bit

1346
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:13,858
to play with it if you are a brand

1347
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:15,299
Distributing out of Mendocino or

1348
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:17,639
Humboldt

1349
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:21,359
and there is a three thousand dollar

1350
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:25,078
order from a retailer in Los Angeles

1351
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:27,058
that drive down right and the drive back

1352
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:29,039
up

1353
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:30,780
um right is a difficult one right so

1354
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:34,558
we're talking Santa Barbara San Louis

1355
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:36,540
Santa Barbara County is dominating the

1356
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,220
greenhouse Market you know glass house

1357
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:41,159
is there but outside of glass house

1358
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:44,039
there's dozens of other uh

1359
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:45,899
greenhouse and hoop house cultivators

1360
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:48,719
that are providing an affordable product

1361
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,680
to the consumer and some are doing very

1362
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:50,279
well

1363
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,759
um

1364
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,920
I think uh marijuana Business Journal I

1365
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,559
buy the report every year my partner's

1366
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:03,240
like you pay 120 for a report I'm like

1367
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:04,980
yes I pay 120 or 150 for this report and

1368
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:06,719
they break down a lot of these economics

1369
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,599
yes they break down a lot of the

1370
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,959
economics year by year and I think the

1371
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,640
2022 report for the previous year broke

1372
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,880
down all the brands in the market share

1373
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:21,000
they had and California had

1374
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,200
over 60 brands that had 50 of the market

1375
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,739
share

1376
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:28,078
that doesn't happen in most Industries

1377
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:31,259
usually the top 50 60 is a handful of

1378
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,180
people yeah so we have 50 60 companies

1379
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:36,720
that are doing

1380
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:38,759
fairly well unfortunately there's 10 000

1381
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,739
licensees so there's a lot of guys that

1382
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,780
are not doing that well or they're

1383
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:44,639
either have the license to cover up

1384
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,960
whatever else the diversion of what

1385
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:48,179
they're doing which is another big thing

1386
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,579
happening in the industry but there are

1387
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:53,338
good operators that are

1388
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:56,039
run a good business and we try to work

1389
00:58:53,338 --> 00:58:57,420
with those companies right that are on

1390
00:58:56,039 --> 00:58:59,279
point

1391
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:01,260
say what do what they say they're going

1392
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,960
to do show up on time a lot of that

1393
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:06,780
stuff matters uh stand behind their

1394
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:09,900
product or consistent don't do the bait

1395
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:12,359
and switch on you and uh so that's kind

1396
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,579
of the few things we look for when we're

1397
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:16,619
collaborating with or working with

1398
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:19,140
Brands and putting them on the shelves

1399
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:21,240
last question what do you think about

1400
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:22,618
Federal legalization would you be in

1401
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:24,779
favor of it and do you think it's going

1402
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:25,619
to happen uh it's definitely going to

1403
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,319
happen

1404
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:31,019
is it gonna happen with President Biden

1405
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:34,679
I don't think so I think he's got a lot

1406
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:36,960
of other issues I think uh deep down

1407
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:38,219
he's not pro-cannabis

1408
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,380
um so I don't I don't see him making

1409
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:43,199
that a priority right

1410
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,240
um depending on who wins the next

1411
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,899
election if it's a Democrat or

1412
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:53,039
Republican either way I think we're

1413
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:55,500
doomed because neither seem to have an

1414
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:59,579
appetite for it I don't think it's high

1415
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:02,579
on the agenda I think the more important

1416
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:04,140
uh decision is going to be who's in the

1417
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:06,480
Senate and who's in control of the

1418
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:08,940
Senate this whole 50 50 I think where

1419
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:12,358
we're at now this lame duck stuff is not

1420
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:15,240
gonna push the Cannabis agenda yeah

1421
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:17,039
um I am for federal legalization which

1422
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:19,618
would mean that you could have La

1423
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:23,818
cannabis in New York or

1424
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:27,358
wherever right so Californians

1425
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:29,219
legalization is is is is a positive I

1426
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:32,219
think there's a lot of things that will

1427
01:00:29,219 --> 01:00:36,358
come with it obviously there are some

1428
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:38,519
cons like large large players will come

1429
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:40,139
in and trying to dominate um they will

1430
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:43,259
dominate yeah they will they will

1431
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:45,960
dominate that 80 percent uh for sure it

1432
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,599
will happen uh maybe not overnight but

1433
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,920
it will happen it happened in Canada

1434
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:52,140
it'll happen here

1435
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:56,338
but but good businesses will come out of

1436
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:58,739
that as as well and California

1437
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:00,659
will probably be the biggest winner yeah

1438
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:02,159
you know as far as cultivation goes and

1439
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:04,980
Brands go

1440
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:06,659
um California wine is some of the most

1441
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:09,838
highly prized wine in in the world

1442
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:13,078
California Cannabis will be some of the

1443
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:16,078
most prized cannabis in the world does

1444
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:19,559
that play into the business plan of some

1445
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:21,420
of the bigger cannabis companies now no

1446
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:23,819
um you know there's been a they actually

1447
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:26,039
exposed some of the bigger companies and

1448
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:28,139
how they've been trying to stop Federal

1449
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:29,460
legalization because it would affect a

1450
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:32,159
lot of their investments in some of

1451
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:33,780
these limited licensed markets they have

1452
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:36,298
millions of dollars of infrastructure

1453
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:38,880
would get rid of their monopolies or

1454
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:42,239
right so even if Federal legalization

1455
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,280
happens uh I think interstate commerce

1456
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,259
is going to be a whole other battle that

1457
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,140
I don't see opening up for a long time

1458
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:52,260
if the big players have uh their way

1459
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:56,519
with the industry which they usually end

1460
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:58,319
up having their way so I'm for it I'm

1461
01:01:56,519 --> 01:02:01,739
for interstate commerce I think

1462
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:04,920
California will benefit tremendously uh

1463
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:06,838
from it I think the nation will as well

1464
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,940
I think some of the product grown in

1465
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:11,279
Colorado and Massachusetts and

1466
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:14,240
Connecticut and some of these states are

1467
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:16,619
horrible I mean horrible product

1468
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:19,558
something good herb from Michigan though

1469
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:22,318
recently right well the outside

1470
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:24,720
environment affects a lot of the indoor

1471
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,920
environment as well yeah because now you

1472
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:29,039
have to

1473
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:32,039
go above and beyond to control the

1474
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:34,920
indoor environment if you have like 70

1475
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:36,358
humidity outside

1476
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,619
you're gonna have to you're gonna have

1477
01:02:36,358 --> 01:02:39,719
to get rid of it yeah or you're gonna

1478
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:42,358
have a problem yeah our weather

1479
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:44,519
obviously pays to our favor here yeah so

1480
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:47,338
there's some areas that cannabis will

1481
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:49,440
just never grow again whale cannabis

1482
01:02:47,338 --> 01:02:51,358
Manufacturing

1483
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,858
happen in California know what's going

1484
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,838
to happen where it happens right like

1485
01:02:52,858 --> 01:02:57,440
Budweiser doesn't

1486
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:59,639
like transport beer across the country

1487
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,039
they brew their own beer wherever they

1488
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:03,420
need to brew it right uh the raw bulk

1489
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:07,019
product will come from a couple of

1490
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:09,539
States California Oregon has really big

1491
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:13,739
yields in the summer they have 15 pound

1492
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:16,679
trees Florida will have one nice Harvest

1493
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:18,598
of high yielding product once a year so

1494
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:21,719
maybe a little product grown in Florida

1495
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:25,818
a little product grown in Oregon a lot

1496
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:29,699
of product grown in California as far as

1497
01:03:25,818 --> 01:03:31,858
outdoor there'll be a bunch of indoor

1498
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:33,659
Boutique branded California lifestyle

1499
01:03:31,858 --> 01:03:37,739
brands that will be sold across the

1500
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:39,539
country definitely Pro legalization I

1501
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:41,578
would support it there's a lot of

1502
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:43,980
benefits to the industry there's the

1503
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:46,980
federal tax issue that the industry

1504
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:48,838
deals with there is the banking that the

1505
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:50,460
industry deals with we pay thousands of

1506
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:52,798
dollars a month for our banking

1507
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:55,740
compliance you have no Bank to deal with

1508
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:59,460
right is it we have a bank but it's very

1509
01:03:55,739 --> 01:04:00,419
expensive and just one bank we bank with

1510
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,659
the

1511
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:06,780
East-West bank so they they are cannabis

1512
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:08,338
friendly but they charge us

1513
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,559
oh God I don't even want to say what

1514
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:12,779
they charge us it's important so

1515
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,940
people's Jaws will hit the floor but um

1516
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:17,280
didn't like Walt Disney start his own

1517
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:19,380
bank to get Disneyland built I I read

1518
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,880
that somewhere recently I mean maybe the

1519
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:24,298
Cannabis industry should think of that

1520
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:27,420
yeah there are hurdles there are Credit

1521
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:30,599
Unions that people bank with as well

1522
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:32,579
um but they have to follow the co-memo

1523
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:34,980
which are the guidelines for Banking and

1524
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:39,480
legal legal cannabis operations state

1525
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:41,219
state by state so for banks

1526
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,199
they have to go through a lot of

1527
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:45,298
compliance when they bank with cannabis

1528
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:49,618
so your Bank of America your Wells Fargo

1529
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:51,900
for a 50 a month account cannot verify

1530
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:53,579
that you're legal and compliant right

1531
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,858
our bank

1532
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:57,780
um they actually get our POS reports and

1533
01:04:55,858 --> 01:05:01,440
our metric reports every month

1534
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:04,260
they audit our books every quarter oh

1535
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:08,159
wow so they have to pay people to audit

1536
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:10,500
us so that when they get audited uh by

1537
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:13,618
the department of I think it's

1538
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:16,980
Department of Justice or whoever the

1539
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:18,420
banking industry is regulated by so they

1540
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:21,000
have to make sure that we're compliant

1541
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:23,338
so that they stay compliant so it's

1542
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:28,019
thousands of dollars a month

1543
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:30,779
to uh stay compliant with banking wow

1544
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:33,119
