1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:08,638
hey how's it going uh today is October

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,879
12th it's starting to finally feel like

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:14,099
it's Autumn and wanted to show you we've

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,800
uh shown some videos before on our

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,618
layered harvesting technique that I know

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,080
a lot of other people use but wanted to

7
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,899
show you how we do it and the benefits

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,358
of doing a layered Harvest so first of

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,459
all oh and by the way this is a Thai

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,560
plant that we've been running for a

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,239
number of years this is our absolute

12
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:38,939
favorite plant for um doing uh sativa

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,759
tinctures has a really nice cartoony

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:46,079
effect so if you like the silly cartoony

15
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:48,718
giggly effect this plant will take you

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,480
there so anyway it's it's a favorite

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,120
anyway so this plant

18
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,698
uh so the layered harvesting system is

19
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,179
when you have outdoor plants that are

20
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:03,299
like Yay big but it doesn't matter what

21
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:07,140
size but the basic concept is this plant

22
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:09,060
used to be about this big and so the top

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,659
outer colas

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,780
uh would uh get ready and ripen first so

25
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,760
we just take those top colas off

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,599
and the plant take it down about two

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,540
feet

28
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,780
and then the other colas the inside

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,299
flowers will then uh get more sunlight

30
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,640
and they'll mature and then get nice and

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,200
big and fat and then you take those and

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,900
you just keep doing that until you've

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,340
got nothing left on the plant so this

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,100
actually

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,600
today we're going to be taking the third

36
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:45,359
Harvest off this particular plant and

37
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,478
just I'm going to cut this and bring it

38
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,299
to the camera to see

39
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,158
but let me know if it when it goes in

40
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,880
focus

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,000
um

42
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,938
so basically right here this bud

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,920
you know a few weeks ago was just tiny

44
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:05,519
little larfy popcorn that had nothing

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,098
but now that it's been exposed to the

46
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,859
sunlight and allowed to develop

47
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,859
it's now this really beautiful

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,980
dense Cola like you could actually trim

49
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,599
this up as a flower

50
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:23,579
um so anyway so that's kind of how this

51
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,378
works then we're going to take this

52
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,239
whole plant down to nothing but I'll

53
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,859
show you another plant so here's another

54
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,439
Thai plant

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,700
same situation and just yeah just look

56
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,699
at the Crystal on there

57
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,539
so

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,060
and the concept being that if uh

59
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,979
if we were to harvested the entire plant

60
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,959
all at once

61
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,000
uh and taking the whole plant out of

62
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,459
here all of this would have been very

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,878
small little popcorn almost unusable

64
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,959
buds but by letting the these uh small

65
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,039
inner

66
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,620
buds now have their time in the Sun and

67
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,900
their time to shine they've totally

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,439
delivered

69
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:14,039
and so now just this one branch here

70
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,680
got some these are like top colas at

71
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,598
this point where a few weeks ago they

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,140
were just like larfy popcorn that you'd

73
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:25,799
almost throw away so anyway you can get

74
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:27,059
sort of triple or quadruple the yield of

75
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,540
really killer

76
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,640
flour if uh if you're interested in

77
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,639
doing just sort of this layered Harvest

78
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,699
so um today we're going to be taking all

79
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,559
these plants down to just a stock so

80
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,439
we're actually starting to close out our

81
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,780
garden at least stuff that's ready but

82
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,699
like this this is a Nigerian plant that

83
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,860
we're growing for the fun of it

84
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,179
this thing's not even gonna be this is

85
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,400
going to be more like

86
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,299
Christmas

87
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,280
yeah

88
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,860
but uh anyway

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,519
all right so that's the layered Harvest

90
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,680
concept we're gonna get on with our

91
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,879
harvesting so hope you have a wonderful

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,519
day

93
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,219
hey just wanted to show one more example

94
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,379
of this tie

95
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:15,479
these buds if we would have harvested

96
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,839
the entire plant all at once these would

97
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,459
have been tiny little larfy nothing buds

98
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,439
but now

99
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,660
hope you can see that I don't know this

100
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,660
camera doesn't always focus on the right

101
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,460
thing maybe it's focus on my nose hairs

102
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,020
instead of the plant

103
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,079
but yeah these are

104
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:35,698
just kill or like trophy buds

105
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,000
that uh

106
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,939
yeah just giving that inner popcorn buds

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,060
a few weeks to mature just get amazing

108
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:48,719
amazing amazing so anyway

109
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm impressed so hope that helps some

110
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,759
folks

111
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,759
enjoy
