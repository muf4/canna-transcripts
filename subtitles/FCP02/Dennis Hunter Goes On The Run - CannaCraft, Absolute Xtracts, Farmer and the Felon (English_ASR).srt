341
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,040
getting little percentages off the

342
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200

343
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,599
dispensaries and

344
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
everything was good for a while um

345
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
you know lake county and built another

346
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,440
big indoor because

347
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,838
dennis perron at the time was like

348
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,839
like oh man we can't get enough weed to

349
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,639
support all this stuff

350
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,040
i know what to do about that

351
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,600
i did like 150 lighter in lake county i

352
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,679
found this nice property and and and

353
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,079
then but the things got hot i had a

354
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,439
property in lake county where i had the

355
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:12,000
150 lighter and then i had another

356
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,160
on the lake in clear lake i had a

357
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,879
house on the lake with a boat dock and

358
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,240
jet ski ducks and the the house was all

359
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,639
the way down the creek right next to the

360
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,560
dam and so i was like i don't want to

361
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,799
drive where i get pulled over and so i

362
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,199
take jet skis all the way and i dock

363
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,120
right below the property on the creek

364
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,360
and i go up over the hill and then go

365
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,839
check on the patch and then the garden

366
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,839
and then the grow and stuff and then

367
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,440
then i go back over and i had like alarm

368
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,519
system there because i was like with the

369
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,040
security store in garberfield and i had

370
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,879
that thing where i had a pager on it had

371
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,480
all the little stuff sensors everywhere

372
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,159
so it'd page me and i could get to a

373
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,600
camera and see what's at the gate

374
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,919
because i never want to get caught like

375
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,120
there you know so i had all this like

376
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,120
like redundancy

377
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,278
and it had a repeater had to go up to

378
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,320
the hill and then back down to the grill

379
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,159
and

380
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,519
and then i'd go back get on jet ski go

381
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,958
back home

382
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,639
i did that for like a year and a half it

383
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,518
was super fun

384
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,600
and then

385
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,799
things got hot jet skiing to work never

386
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,600
