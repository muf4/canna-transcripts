ghana was also the first

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,640
african country to be independent so

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,598
ghana has always been

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,399
you know at the forefront of many

59
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,639
amazing innovations and advancement on

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,319
the continent and people we like to call

61
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:25,039
it the gateway to africa and i was born

62
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,000
on a military barracks at the time so my

63
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,000
father

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
was part of the ghanaian army and at the

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,639
same time too he came from a traditional

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,959
royal family so i had a you know a

67
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,049
combination of tradition and at the same

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,479
time too

69
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,040
[Music]

70
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,518
yes so i grew up you know in an

71
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,878
environment of tradition which i was

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,159
getting from

73
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,878
that my my home and then also because my

74
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,719
father was in the military discipline

75
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,878
you know and then at the same time to it

76
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,000
was really at a time when the ghanaian

77
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,759
military was in political power so i

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,439
also grew up in an environment that was

79
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,639
politically charged

80
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,039
and all of those elements became

81
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,199
you know a way of seeding who i became

82
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,759
you know and i became you know somebody

83
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,479
who loved music somebody who loved

84
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,158
politics somebody who loved uh engaging

85
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,280
the world and at the same time somebody

86
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,158
who

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,239
is proud of the cultural uh

88
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,919
background and foundations that i grew

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,640
up from

90
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,598
and

91
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,279
was that

92
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,158
near akra

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,439
um i actually uh which is the capital

94
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,919
right

95
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,519
the capital of ghana is accra

96
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,878
uh and then

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,319
where i grew up is tema tema is actually

98
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,919
part of accra

99
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,919
so it looked like the malibu of

100
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,799
from the map i was looking at yeah yeah

101
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,719
yeah you know tema was like a place you

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,040
know the tema has the port

103
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,359
uh but the parks was a little far from

104
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,359
where the port was and um

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,280
first they call it the first infantry

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,519
brigade you know so

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
it was you know it was a very strategic

108
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,719
uh military base for the ghanaian

109
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,840
military you know and you know growing

110
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,280
up there was

111
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,039
you know i it was kind of a very

112
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,039
sheltered environment

113
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,438
but at the same time too

114
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,959
it was a place that i felt uh provided

115
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,719
me the opportunity to

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,959
you know grow

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,199
uh and be able to

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,199
you know learn certain things that have

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,800
become very uh key to who i become like

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
you know you know it's the sense of

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,319
discipline the sense of you know

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,360
constantly wanting to strive and achieve

123
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,560
and and then also a drive you know that

124
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,280
became a key part of really my musical

125
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,600
journey you know starting from ghana and

126
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,079
building my base in ghana and then you

127
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,479
know expanding my musical reach to

128
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,279
beyond the confines of ghana

129
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,399
and speaking of your musical background

130
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,319
who are your earliest musical influences

131
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,120
well you know their thing was that they

132
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:02,079
were there was the traditional music so

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,319
everybody that grows up in ghana or any

134
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,240
part of africa you are first exposed to

135
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:10,000
your cultural music because you know our

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,800
traditions and culture are very very

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,519
deep and we all come from deep tribes

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,919
so

139
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,399
my tribal music was something that i was

140
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,639
exposed to earlier on but then at the

141
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,638
same time too i was just exposed to the

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,319
music of other tribes you know living in

143
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,560
a tema was an area that was um the

144
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,560
traditional area of grass you know uh

145
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,560
the tribe there it was called the ghans

146
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,639
so gun music was very prominent you

147
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,399
heard it around and then at the same

148
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,800
time two other traditional ghanaian

149
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,758
musical forms were there so those were

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,918
the initial found musical foundation and

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,199
then there was also high life music

152
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,359
which was kind of ghana's version of the

153
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,240
pop music you know so

154
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,240
my initial heroes were the high life you

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
know heroes of you know those days you

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,600
know so african brothers

157
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,680
uh was one of the first bands that

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
i kind of gravitated towards and african

159
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,600
brothers their high life variants too

160
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
was the foundation

161
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,800
of that style that became popular all

162
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,038
over uh west africa and also was the

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,280
musical form that eventually evolved

164
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,918
into afrobeat and all these other styles

165
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,638
that most people right now are hearing

166
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:23,758
and are used to you know so from then

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,920
onwards then i became exposed to uh

168
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,199
reggae music

169
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,080
[Music]

170
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,439
yeah i was just gonna ask you

171
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,120
can you tell us when you first heard

172
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,918
reggae and bob marley so yes um well

173
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,800
what happened was that you know to give

174
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,399
more of a a broader background was that

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
reggae music

176
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,638
you know ghana has an ancestral

177
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,959
connection to jamaica right and uh also

178
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,160
because of ghana's pan-african history

179
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,719
uh our first president uh kwame nkrumah

180
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,000
was very he he studied here in the

181
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,000
united states so he came back to ghana

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,839
uh ghana became the first african

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,519
country to be independent so his whole

184
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:08,000
idea immediately

185
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,000
was connecting ghana to the diaspora

186
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,560
the first president of ghana uh

187
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,318
kwame nkrumah

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,439
he was actually named the african of the

189
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,720
millennium

190
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,478
um he

191
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
led ghana to

192
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,598
its independence ghana being the first

193
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,799
country in africa to be independent in

194
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,399
one year

195
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,840
19

196
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,239
1957. oh wow yeah

197
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,079
and when he became president his initial

198
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
idea was connecting africa to the

199
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,598
diaspora because he lived in america he

200
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,279
was influenced by

201
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,519
you know the

202
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:45,198
you know their pan-africanist movement

203
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,198
that was going on here w.e.b

204
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,280
so he wanted to create a model african

205
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,280
country

206
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,918
a lot of jamaicans came from that

207
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,160
geographic area because obviously in

208
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,159
those days we didn't have those you know

209
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
it wasn't you know

210
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
ordered into different countries that

211
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,800
was a colonial thing that was created

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,680
but most jamaicans came from tribes that

213
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
were situated in that area

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
so

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
ethiopia

216
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,878
it was mostly west africa yeah west

217
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,120
africa yeah and so there was that i felt

218
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,439
that it was like that connection that

219
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,918
uh innate understanding the dna of the

220
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,478
music yeah yeah also could be

221
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,399
comprehended there you know so reggae

222
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,879
kind of took root there

223
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,918
and also the messages that reggae was

224
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,838
you know kind of projecting were about

225
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:42,399
elevation of african ideals african

226
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,279
culture uh you know uh blackness

227
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,120
empowerment of africa and i think that

228
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,958
because the ghanaian military seen

229
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,278
themselves too as

230
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,000
liberators of the continent

231
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,879
the music took roots there oh wow yeah

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,278
so

233
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,679
you know in the barracks you heard a lot

234
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,879
of reggae music you know yeah yeah peter

235
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:05,519
tosh burning spear you know those early

236
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,039
uh forefathers from the sound were very

237
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,879
very popular there

238
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,838
so obviously bob marley was a very

239
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,159
you know

240
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,040
undeniable presence

241
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,719
and

242
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,120
for me

243
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,560
i was not fully you know i was into

244
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,120
other music i was not kind of aware of

245
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,278
bob marley i had heard the mu i've heard

246
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,159
of his name and all of that but i was

247
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,559
not really a big reggae fan at that time

248
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,879
what changed it was that there was a

249
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,838
military band that used to

250
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,679
do

251
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,760
cover songs

252
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,958
you know so

253
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,639
i was kind of i had kind of

254
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,159
figured out that music was something

255
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,039
that i wanted to do

256
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,519
so i gravitated towards anywhere that i

257
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,559
could find music being played or

258
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,759
anything

259
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,639
so

260
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,519
i i ended up starting to spend time in

261
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:04,078
the rehearsal space of the military band

262
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,879
so when the album uprising came out

263
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,239
above mali's album they were rehearsing

264
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,278
the album

265
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
to

266
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,799
to uh to play them

267
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,879
and the song that i remember i went

268
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:20,159
there and then they were trying to learn

269
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,039
coming in from the cold

270
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,639
so

271
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,719
from the cold

272
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,519
you know yeah and i remember i was just

273
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,160
like wow that's a really cool song i

274
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,919
wonder who sang it

275
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,919
you know because it had not heard i had

276
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,838
not heard the song but i heard the band

277
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,958
rehearsing it so you know the guy you

278
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,880
know they will start you know and then

279
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,319
the bass line and then how the song

280
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,639
started you know just like this is

281
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
brilliant yeah yeah you know so

282
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:48,879
afterwards i was like wow that's bob

283
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,879
marley you know and so that led me into

284
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,759
you know the music

285
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,600
and

286
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,720
not long afterwards

287
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,800
you know bob passed on yeah you know and

288
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,959
um 81 81 yeah so

289
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,838
it was like something that

290
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,078
you know really resonated with me and i

291
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,040
was an artist trying to also find my

292
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,439
voice

293
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,599
and coming from the military barracks

294
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,360
and believing and also using my music as

295
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,720
a means to project

296
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
social issues political issues and also

297
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
empowering

298
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,759
uh you know my people and also using

299
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,879
that as a cultural conversation with the

300
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,039
world reggae made sense as kind of a

301
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,559
music that i gravitated and obviously

302
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,879
bob marley's voice but in addition to

303
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,278
artists like fella cutie right who were

304
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,200
also very popular at that time and so

305
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,120
the soldiers had kind of a love-hate

306
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,519
relationship with felicity's music

307
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
because he sang against

308
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,240
the nigerian army

309
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,639
but the ghanaian army loved him

310
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
you know and so you hear songs like

311
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,320
zombie

312
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,320
nigerian army it was against nigerian

313
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,000
army but a ghanaian army was like we're

314
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,320
not nigerian yeah i was wondering who

315
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,360
that was about yeah you know so so like

316
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,519
water

317
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,600
get mean gets no enemies yeah water gets

318
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,959
real that's pretty awesome yeah but

319
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,959
there was also you know like a

320
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,039
derogatory term that people used to call

321
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,039
the soldiers where zombie you know you

322
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,439
know yeah you know you just hated that

323
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,319
name you know interesting you know so so

324
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,959
those styles you know so fella and bob

325
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,399
marley i'll say where the popular ones

326
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,159
that inspired me

327
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,720
well i can see both of their influences

328
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,639
in your music yes yes yes you know but

329
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,200
underneath it was like also the

330
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,360
traditional music the cultural music and

331
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,000
the high life music of ghana

332
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,919
and was reggae always legal to play in

333
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,759
ghana oh yeah yeah yeah reagan music was

334
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,240
okay very popular because i know that

335
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,958
like lucky debate in south africa had to

336
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,560
wait until like it became legal i think

337
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,278
at some point well south africa still

338
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,278
was under

339
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,279

all right never mind moving on yeah

398
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,800
um so when did you actually start

399
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,120
playing music and writing songs

400
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:08,479
writing started way earlier you know

401
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,799
because i remember being

402
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,240
a little kid from around the age of five

403
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:17,278
years you know i recognized that ability

404
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,560
yeah and so i started making up

405
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,519
songs

406
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,599
you know i will hear something and i'll

407
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,959
make it up and

408
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,519
i will

409
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,958
you know hear melodies now gravitate

410
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,679
towards the melody and start really

411
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,479
analyzing them so when it comes to when

412
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,958
people ask me about songwriting i say

413
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,159
it came it was there i thought that it

414
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,559
was always part of me like i was born

415
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,799
with that already in me right and then

416
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,119
at five i started recognizing it yeah

417
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,879
and then five yeah around the age of

418
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,519
five and then by seven years i was

419
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,639
making up my own songs but there were

420
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,560
never

421
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,680
things that i realized that you know i

422
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,518
was gonna

423
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,120
do it professionally yeah yeah but i was

424
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,159
i was making them up

425
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,919
and

426
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,278
professionally

427
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,719
i'll say

428
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,759
by the time i got to

429
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
um

430
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,519
let me see

431
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,278
12 years that is when i sat for my

432
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,839
common insurance exam to secondary

433
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:18,320
school in ghana as by time i was i got

434
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,160
to secondary school i was already

435
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,560
singing stuff that

436
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,879
are where original stuff but i was doing

437
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,638
it without telling people that i was the

438
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,559
one that composed them so what i would

439
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
do is that i usually will i was kind of

440
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,879
the noisiest kid

441
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,479
around you know hold little parties you

442
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,240
know people will be playing on this and

443
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,800
then i'll sing and i'll sing popular

444
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,639
songs and stuff and add it to it so i

445
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,198
you know i always created that

446
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,120
environment wherever i was and then that

447
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,439
was kind of part of nurturing my

448
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,000
songwriting yeah but

449
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,440
when i got to i remember when i got to

450
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,519
secondary school which is probably the

451
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,279
college equivalent here

452
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,839
that was when i started

453
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,710
seriously putting structure

454
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,199
to

455
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,038
[Music]

456
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,318
and so

457
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,798
then you were writing in second year

458
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,678
yeah yes in secondary school but what

459
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:14,240
the way the writing was was because

460
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,720
you know because we never had it was

461
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,880
hard to have access to guitars and

462
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,199
instruments because those were expensive

463
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,640
yeah so your father would never any like

464
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,480
you want to be a musician no no no no

465
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,880
you go to school yeah so that was kind

466
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,360
of how things were so

467
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,360
musicians were seen as oh those people

468
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,439
you know they just follow women and

469
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,279
smoke a lot and drink a lot and they

470
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,919
like wayward people and all of you know

471
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,119
that was kind of like prevailing mindset

472
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
you know so

473
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,918
life of a musician exactly so being a

474
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,440
musician was not something that you know

475
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,400
you go out and say that's a career

476
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,679
choice

477
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,280
you know it's a partner you got to

478
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,080
believe in it and you got to make

479
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,678
everybody accept it absolutely so

480
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,960
the kind of

481
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,280
style of music was what i figured i hear

482
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,160
you call beatbox

483
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:05,119
so we started by

484
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,000
you create the song

485
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,199
and also i could hear the instruments in

486
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,679
my head

487
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,759
so then i had a few friends

488
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,360
who were also taken by what i would do

489
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,119
so i will have one on the baseline

490
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,439
one play the drum

491
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,359
and then we will just make up the songs

492
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,519
like that yeah yeah yeah so that was

493
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,000
kind of how we started creating

494
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,679
structure to what was in our mind

495
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,279
starting right started writing songs

496
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,000
because we didn't have instruments yeah

497
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,000
yeah so my first even albums

498
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,679
that eventually i did that was kind of

499
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,279
the style

500
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,280
that i eventually evolved into my first

501
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,279
demo you know i remember when i was

502
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,000
doing the demo a friend had

503
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,440
two

504
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
tape recorders

505
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,640
you know and then another friend had

506
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,558
like a nice

507
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,480
cassette right she bouncing back and

508
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,240
forth yeah yeah so i went to her and i

509
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,919

back but

518
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,519
the the the first demo was putting the

519
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,480
tape in there

520
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,119
you know recording uh you know recording

521
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,960
having somebody sing and then me

522
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,599
and singing it directly into the tape

523
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,480
with somebody i mean and then afterwards

524
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,480
we played that to another cassette

525
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,960
and then we added stuff so that was kind

526
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,480
of how we we did it and then created you

527
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,200
know the first demo for people to hear

528
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,880
that oh wow you know this is a song okay

529
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,038
this is how the bass goes and all of

530
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,160
that i think what it did for me too was

531
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,279
that it

532
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,880
allowed me to be able to be a uh

533
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,960
develop

534
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,160
production instincts

535
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,798
that whenever i wrote songs i could

536
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,400
easily go into a studio and then say

537
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,558
okay this is how the bass go this is how

538
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,798
the drum goes this is how that goes

539
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,798
created that instinct you know for me to

540
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,798
be able to be a good arranger and also a

541

from your grammy-nominated 2015 album

577
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,559
branches of the same tree yeah

578
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:01,759
is like an anthemic dancehall too right

579
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,079
yes and the video is is a visual

580
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,000
experience and cinematic experience like

581
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,678
so many of your other videos yes can we

582
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,558
talk about making that video and your

583
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,200
videos in general i mean wow yeah

584
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,918
you know when i came to spend time in

585
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,240
america you know lived here

586
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,559
and started seeing i mean

587
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,319
everybody's impressed with what

588
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:23,519
artists like michael jackson did with

589
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,439
videos

590
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,079
you know videos became a means by which

591
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,519
you could tell a new story beyond what

592
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,839
the music is

593
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,158
you know so you use that to expand on

594
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,119
the concept of what exactly the art the

595
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,000
music

596
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,038
is

597
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,359
so

598
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,759
personally too i kind of gravitated

599
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,719
towards that idea that you know whenever

600
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,798
you were doing a music uh a music video

601
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
the song was the starting point yeah and

602
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,200
if you have a great director too who has

603
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,240
a great vision they could also help to

604
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,319
really push oh you know so

605
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,120

probably i want to you know you know he

640
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,440
visually he visually too because the

641

643
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,440
because

644
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,440
african thriller you know we're thinking

645
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,480
okay michael jackson

646
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,480
uh we were thinking

647
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,000
manila you know that's boxing yeah um

648
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,599
you know inter so it was paying homage

649
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,119
to also

650
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,719
african create african and

651
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,479
african-american creatives who have

652
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,720
excelled from muhammad ali

653
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,519
to michael jackson and at the same time

654
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,000
to

655
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:44,000
uh africa where

656
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,079
uh the the big uh boxing match between

657
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,759
foreman and muhammad ali

658
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,038
zaire yeah you know with all you know

659
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,720
james brown was there so it was a

660
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,679
combination of music

661
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,839
and also boxing oh yeah and then at the

662
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,480
same time using that too to create a

663
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,798
conversation piece between the diaspora

664
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,919
and also the motherland yeah in a way

665
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,079
that is fun it's inclusive and using

666
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,919
dance as a metaphor that's beautiful of

667
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,759
boxing so you step in the ring but

668
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,799
you're not going there to go and fight

669
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:18,158
you're going there to showcase how you

670
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:20,639
know your day your moves yep you know so

671
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,960
philosophically there was a gr it was a

672
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,360
great concept and then we just knew that

673
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,880
you know with glenn you know he could

674
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,000
you know so he needed a space and i

675
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,720
remember we

676
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,599
we filmed it in uh in a boxing ring in

677
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,360
pokemon you know uh he brought spoda

678
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,199
yeah i mean you think it was filmed in

679
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,000

843
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,480

844
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,879
for high life lovers within ghana yeah

845

traditional high life stuff that i had

869
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:48,960
adapted

870
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,519
a much more

871
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,400
funky way you know so i was like okay

872
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:57,199
why not record this song which is a

873
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,200
traditional standard it's also high life

874
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,838
music and at the same time two hours

875
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,679
like high life music in ghana never got

876
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,920
opportunity of being recorded probably

877
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,358
in a studio like the village studios

878
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,440
which is one of the top studios in the

879
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:12,000
world oh yeah so

880
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,838
i was like let me do that so i went in

881
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,119
you know organized my band here and the

882
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:16,000
band 2

883
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,559
um

884
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,440
was from all around the world from

885
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,199
brazil from cuba from so

886
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,480
traditional high life music from ghana

887
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,559
now being played by a global cast

888
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,159
i could tell they

889
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,599
because you know i have another question

890
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,719
about the musicians on that song but

891
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:38,240
keep going yeah so so we went in there

892
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:40,078
and then recorded the song you know and

893
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,239
it just came out really beautifully oh

894
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,079
yeah and then afterwards i was like okay

895
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,439
the original

896
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,359
had uh you know original was traditional

897
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,519
right but then there's been remixed by

898
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:54,000
certain hip-hop artists

899
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,159
but i felt that okay if i am remaking it

900
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,599
then i have to work with you know some

901
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:03,358
of the cutting edge uh you know yeah

902
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,119
artists and and the language too was chi

903
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,960
which is the language of the ashanti

904
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,280
tribe ghana so that was the language of

905
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,800
the song and one of the top

906
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,040
uh rappers in chi was sakura yeah so i

907
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,359
called up sarkodie and said hey you know

908
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,960
i'm doing a remake of uh changing

909
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,119
vietnamese when all of that and i feel

910
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,400
that you know you should be on it and

911
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,000
it's like send it to me let me hear it

912
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,160
and he heard it's like wow this is this

913
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,599
sounds good like very well recorded and

914
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,679
like you know it's

915
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,119
you know really amazing you know so he

916
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,679
also added his

917
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,480
bit to it and uh it became it sounds

918
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:39,279
good yeah it became that beautiful

919
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,320
uh you know i feel that we really did a

920
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,079
great homage to that song yeah and uh

921
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,039
etched another high life masterpiece uh

922
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,560
re

923
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,880
refreshed it for a new audience yeah

924
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,838
well i i certainly like listening to it

925
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,760
that's for sure

926
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,599
um and then my question was where did

927
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,240
the horn section come from

928
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,480
oh the whole section yeah that whole

929
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:07,039
section so the whole section is uh it

930
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,519
seemed like it was almost afro cuban

931
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,119
yes because the trumpet trumpetized from

932
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,480
cuber right

933
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,519
uh the trombonist is from brazil

934
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,440
and then

935
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:20,159
and then the saxophonist is

936
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,440
african-american oh wow so

937
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:26,639
i had it was not a ghanaian yes this was

938
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,039
like the diasporian cats and different

939
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,598
dimensions of the diaspora that played

940
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,358
the horn so yeah so you know they like

941
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,400
sinking deep into the song there's so

942
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:40,239
many different elements that kind of

943
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,720
gave it such you know deep spirituals

944
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:45,598
and cultural significance because it was

945
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:48,078
a a song that was its inception was from

946
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,838
ghana but then that remake

947
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,119
also took into consideration all the

948
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:54,799
diaspora sounds and stuff and bringing

949
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,800
it back and bringing it right back yeah

950
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,800
yeah that is amazing

951
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,599
um how many albums have you released so

uh

970
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,800
shall i say

971
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,159
growing up yeah

972
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,640
you

973
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,239
and also growing up in um talking about

974
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,838
my military growing up in the military

975
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,838
barracks that was politicized

976
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,079
we were constantly exposed to

977
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,078
issues that required attention

978
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,560
because the ghanaian military

979
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,400
was in power then so they were dealing

980
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,400
with national issues

981
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,079
so wherever i walked you know like you

982
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,318
know wherever i found a bunch of

983
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,000
soldiers gathered and you know after

984
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,318
work and they were chatting the

985
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,079
conversations were always about

986
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:15,358
development

987
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,160
they were about

988
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:20,159
how to make the country better

989
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,358
so those conversations

990
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,039
i was privy to all of that yeah yeah so

991
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,318
at an early

992
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:27,519
age

993
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,358
i was

994
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,759
figuring trying to figure out how i

995
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,519
could also make a difference

996
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,839
and at the same time to most of the

997
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:39,679
ghanaian soldiers to where

998
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,559
part of the u.n peacekeeping force

999
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,719
because

1000
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,759
when i was a little kid there was the

1001
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,679

1004
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,039
think more i don't know what i got yom

1005
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,279
kippur one yeah but most of the soldiers

1006
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,400
were kind of stabilizing phones that was

1007
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,079
sent to

1008
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,119
egypt

1009
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:06,079
part of the u.n force to go there and

1010
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,400
you know be in between yeah yeah all the

1011
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,359
all the feuding countries you know to

1012
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,838
try and maintain stability there so

1013
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,199
so whenever they came

1014
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,358
you know they were talking about all

1015
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,318
these divisions and how

1016
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,239
you know

1017
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,119
they could they could be so there was

1018
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,078
like

1019
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,838
i was

1020
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,800
sponging all of this the united

1021
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:28,799
nations um

1022
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,440
local politics

1023
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,519
you know trying to make a change

1024
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,240
um at the same time too

1025
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,639
they

1026
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,399
the influences that all these soldiers

1027
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,400
who were exposed to that part of the

1028
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,680
world were bringing right back home they

1029
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,440
were not bringing it to ghana they were

1030
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,759
bringing it right into the confines of

1031
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,480
the military barracks so we lived in a

1032
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,079
very tight place so it started

1033
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,358
building

1034
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,640
that

1035
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:58,318
need in me to be a voice

1036
00:43:54,639 --> 00:44:00,159
for social transformation yeah uh to be

1037
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,358
to utilize whatever

1038
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,559
uh gifts that i felt god had given me

1039
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,239
to

1040
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,480
to to help society in advance and also

1041
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:13,679
to speak truth to power and at the same

1042
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,920
time to use it as a means to

1043
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:18,480
empower people

1044
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,200
but i also felt that

1045
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,280
it's one thing writing about it it's

1046
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,000
ranting talking about it it's one thing

1047
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,280
sitting on the stage and writing lyrics

1048
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,318
about it

1049
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,200
you can only make some of those changes

1050
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:33,199

1051

going on you know but you know

1084

underneath all of that too you know

1085
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,599
people are going about their lives like

1086
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,240
everywhere you know but

1087
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,440
since the crisis the global crisis

1088
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:50,239
happened

1089
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,480
what

1090
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,279
it has done is that it literally killed

1091
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,358
a lot of the night life

1092
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,319
which ghana was has been struggling in a

1093
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,199
way to kind of bring that back so it

1094
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:03,199
really

1095
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:05,759
killed that and then now

1096
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,439
people are just trying to

1097
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,319
you know get their lives back get back

1098
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,280
to normal yeah get back to um you know a

1099
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,199
semblance of normality yeah right now

1100
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,599
you know like the rest of the world like

1101
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,679
the rest of the world yeah yes

1102
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,400
um

1103
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:25,358
and i hate to ask about another city but

1104
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,880
you wrote about nairobi oh yeah you love

1105
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:28,639
nairobi and i just wanted to ask you

1106
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,920
what do you love about nairobi that's in

1107
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:34,159
kenya right yeah you know actually that

1108
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,079
song was um

1109
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,440
was a metaphor

1110
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,160
so

1111
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,039
what happened was that kenya had a big

1112
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:45,279
political issue i mean the issue is you

1113
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,759
know is steeped in the history of kenya

1114
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,560
which i'm not gonna go deeply into

1115
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,240
but

1116
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,639
there are

1117
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,519
two big political factions that have

1118
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:54,400
been

1119
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,920
kind of

1120
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,358
fighting for power a long time and then

1121
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,440
there's been one

1122
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,679
faction that has been in power

1123
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,318
for that length so

1124
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:09,118
and all these factions too

1125
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:11,440
revolve around tribes

1126
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,079
so one faction is two tribes another

1127
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,720
faction is one major tribe with other

1128
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,880
minor tribes around it so it's not only

1129
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:21,679
political but it's also steeped in

1130
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,838
cultural and identity and all of that

1131
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,838
so

1132
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:27,519
um everybody will remember that kenya

1133
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,759
had elections

1134
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:32,079
and that election was contested

1135
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,520
and then there was like a big huge

1136
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,359
problem where

1137
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:38,079
people started fighting the country

1138
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:40,639
nearly fell apart and then the u.n kofi

1139
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,200
annan and everybody went in there so it

1140
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,960
was between kenyatta and also raila

1141
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,639
odinga

1142
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,000
so when

1143
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:52,239
that period went through and they kind

1144
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,719
of got to a point of understanding an

1145
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:56,959
agreement and they were just about to do

1146
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,118
another elections after a few years of

1147
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,440
stabilizing the situation

1148
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,280
um you know in which the international

1149
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,639
court of justice were all involved in

1150
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,040
and kenyatta was actually at first uh he

1151
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,039
was going to be charged in the

1152
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,800
you know with crimes against his people

1153
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,960
and all of that but eventually all of

1154
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,160
that was resolved and he decided to do

1155
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,519
an election

1156
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,358
so

1157
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,639
i was invited to kenya at that time

1158
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,239
as

1159
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:28,960
part of a peace initiative

1160
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:31,519
with the red cross of

1161
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,119
to come and

1162
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,599
you know work

1163
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,760
uh with musicians and all of that as

1164
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,119
part of the peace building and also

1165
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,000
trying to

1166
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,720
you know

1167
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,519
create a peaceful foundation for that

1168
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:47,279
election that was just about to happen

1169
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,599
so i traveled in

1170
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,200
i you know with the red cross you know

1171
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,800
we went into areas like kibera

1172
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:57,519
meeting you know to meetings with

1173
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,880
various musicians various groups

1174
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:02,719
um you know

1175
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,318
promoting peace promoting inter tribal

1176
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,078
you know connection and then also an

1177
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,838
ideal of

1178
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,880
a united kenya

1179
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,000
an ideal of a united people

1180
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,440
and

1181
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,079
whilst i was going through all of this

1182
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,599
i felt that there was such a deep rift

1183
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,720
between the people that was not

1184
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,519
political

1185
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:25,039

1186
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,039

1187
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,719
ghanas was not even

1188
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,239
you know ghana's division when it comes

1189
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,439

capitals in africa and all of that there

1218
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,079
was a certain pride to it so i was like

1219
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,639
okay

1220
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,359
maybe what i needed to do was uh write a

1221
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:44,400
song about something that

1222
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,440
unites everybody and they use that as a

1223
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,920
premise

1224
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,960
to speak about harmony

1225
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,680
and unity yeah well then so it's a great

1226
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,720
song yeah so the song nairobi was kind

1227
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,440
of

1228
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,838
birthed out of that intention and

1229
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,920
connected yeah

1230
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:04,719
i just had to wonder you know

1231
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,440
um because you did keep the the politics

1232
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,639
out of that um

1233
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,800
you know

1234
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:13,358
here we are at kelly high and so i feel

1235
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,400
i have to ask you is is herb legal in

1236
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,199
ghana

1237
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,599
herb is not legal in ghana and many

1238
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,639
african countries um

1239
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,440
you know

1240
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:23,358
have

1241
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,639
you know because african countries uh

1242
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,799
inherited

1243
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:29,920
a lot of their constitution

1244
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,960
and a lot of their judiciary judiciary

1245
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,760
from

1246
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,960
the colonial colonial uh entities powers

1247
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,000
that were there

1248
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:40,400
you know so herb was also something that

1249
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,639
you know all around you know urban hemp

1250
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,000
were banned in most of those places and

1251
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,318
that

1252
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,000
was also replicated in these places

1253
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:52,000
right right and to some extent it also

1254
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,760
wrapped around in

1255
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,039
people thinking that

1256
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,280
herb causes craziness

1257
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,199
you know it was like everybody said that

1258
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,280
most of the mad people in the street

1259
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,439
they will always say oh dear oh we

1260
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,359
smokes you know so there's kind of a

1261
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,440
false narrative that i think has kind of

1262
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:11,358
its roots from here that was also

1263
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,358
perpetrated all over there so it was

1264
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:14,880
something that was seen as the yeah

1265
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:16,799
serious type and stigma it was something

1266
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,760
that was seen as

1267
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,119
deviant you know and also

1268
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,480
that it was

1269
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,838
also people it it causes illness it was

1270
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,318
terrible for the community and the

1271
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,440
society so

1272
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:30,719
you know

1273
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,440
everybody was

1274
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,879
against it and but the musicians it was

1275
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,880
popular within the musicians and the

1276
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,240
creative community that's why everybody

1277
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,519
was like oh you want to be a musician

1278
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,439
you know those people they just smoke

1279
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,880
wee and all of that kind of stuff nobody

1280
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,079
wanted their daughters to marry a

1281
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,720
musician because they're like they're

1282
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,720
not stable people

1283
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:58,000
so

1284
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,720
so most african countries were very

1285
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,719
adamant and then it got also one way or

1286
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,439
they got wrapped into

1287
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:06,558
the religious establishment

1288
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,480
so they

1289
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,800
the religious establishment also

1290
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,960
constantly is preaching against oh yeah

1291
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,960
you know people who were

1292
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,920
yeah yeah they want to see that people

1293
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,599
who

1294
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,440
you know anytime they're talking about

1295
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,039
people who didn't make it in life they

1296
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,679
like you know they ended up being a we

1297
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:26,639
smoker they ended up being this drinking

1298
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:29,440
and smoking weed it was seen as

1299
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,400
people who never were able to make it

1300
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,119
into

1301
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:37,280
uh you know the society

1302
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:40,400
um and fell off it was always blamed on

1303
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,559
that so that stigma has survived

1304
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,480
up till now although

1305
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,680
when you look critically there's a lot

1306
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,920
of people

1307
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:49,519
who are beyond that stigma artists and

1308
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,760
even people in

1309
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,599
you know government places and

1310
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,720
all attitudes will change right yeah

1311
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,960
yeah you know but now it's changing yeah

1312
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:01,279
it's changing because

1313
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,599
other parts of the world are doing so so

1314
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,359
yeah exactly and then most of these

1315
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,359
economies too are seeing

1316
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,519
the numbers from

1317
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,759
other economies that are

1318
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,759
you know but the political will is still

1319
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,040
lacking from most of the leaders because

1320
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,960
they feel that

1321
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,039
if you legalize it first of all you're

1322
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,960
going to lose your base because it's

1323
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,039
aggressive

1324
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,639
so you're going to lose that so most of

1325
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:26,480
them are walking

1326
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:28,719
you know kind of a fine line between it

1327
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,039
but there some countries that are

1328
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:33,519
are decriminalizing

1329
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:36,960
the farming right of it

1330
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:39,358
but they are not legalizing yeah the use

1331
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,358
of it you know and then recently in

1332
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,519
ghana too

1333
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,119
it's uh it's amazing that i'm doing this

1334
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,358
interview right now because

1335
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,880
just about a week ago

1336
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:51,039
uh the

1337
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,160
the ghanaian government also

1338
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:55,599
uh came out and said that they are just

1339
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:56,719
on the verge

1340
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,838
of uh

1341
00:54:56,719 --> 00:54:59,519
allowing

1342
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,480
the farming

1343
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:04,838
of hemp hemp

1344
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:08,079
yeah 0.3

1345
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:10,400
thc um you know and

1346
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:13,839
we feel that it is a you know it's a a

1347
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:16,079
major step because obviously if

1348
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,199
they feel a certain concern

1349
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,960
about

1350
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,480
you know legalizing it and then all of a

1351
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,838
sudden everybody's walking around the

1352
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,880
streets

1353
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:25,679
you know

1354
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,838
uh smoking which was actually

1355
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,519
you know to even diverge to a funny

1356
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,798
situation was that

1357
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,318
the first time it was announced that

1358
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:37,119
the government was thinking about doing

1359
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,039
that the following day social media

1360
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,640
everybody was people were putting things

1361
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:42,000
off lighting

1362
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,078
on there and all of that i was just like

1363
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,318
hey guys a little bit too soon yeah a

1364
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,160
little bit too soon because that's not

1365
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:49,519
what these guys are talking about and

1366
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:53,039
you're actually

1367
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:55,519
kind of exposing the greatest fear

1368
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:58,480
you know of everybody walking around and

1369
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,318
lighting it up you know and smoking in

1370
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,798
the streets and all that just

1371
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:05,358
relax and allow them the space to be

1372
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:07,280
able to you know move this along you

1373
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:08,880
know their own pace of some kind yeah

1374
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,400
yeah you know but but you know it's

1375
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,920
something that

1376
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,920
it is

1377
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,720
you know i think it's ridiculous

1378
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,960
that

1379
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:20,000
most of these countries are not seeing

1380
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,760
it as a means by which they could deal

1381
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,480
with their debt issues

1382
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,520
they could oh yeah restart benefits yeah

1383
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,679
economy money one thing and at the same

1384
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,679
time to the health benefits of it

that you know these are all things that

1390
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:45,039

we talked about that a little bit yes

1425
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,880
you know the thing is that it's very

1426
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:12,318
hard these days to keep a standing band

1427
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,519
yeah yeah unless

1428
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:15,599
uh the

1429
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,480
economics of the

1430
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,359
you know the industry right does not

1431
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,639
allow

1432
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:23,598
most of the time especially when you

1433
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:25,118
leave you're operating from major cities

1434

to work with musicians on that level

1450
00:58:55,358 --> 00:59:01,838
um it's um you know they're also equally

1451
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:04,639
uh you know

1452
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,318
in demand in everywhere and you have to

1453
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:09,358
come to terms with that you know but i

1454
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,960
have you know i have a solid band yeah

1455
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:13,039
here in the united states and then also

1456
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,679
a solid band in ghana that's to work

1457
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:17,440
with yeah and so plans for touring now

1458
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,759
that things are opening up

1459
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,599
yes yes uh we're hoping so but you know

1460
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,599
the thing is that things are opening up

1461
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,798
but they're not the touring world has

1462
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,720
not it's not necessarily like in america

1463
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:30,159
looks like things are open up much more

1464
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:33,439
faster

1465
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:35,679
than in europe yeah there's really not

1466
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,599
much going on in europe i mean basically

1467
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:39,358
our you know touring and booking

1468
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,359
agencies over there have said that

1469
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,279
literally just forget the year

1470
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,279
you know because nothing is really going

1471
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,079
to happen and then from the news too we

1472
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,240
are seeing that europe is even getting

1473
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,280
you know things i've been shutting down

1474
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:52,000
more

1475
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,200
yeah

1476
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,920
you know

1477
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:55,679
yeah

1478
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,119
instead of yeah instead of opening up

1479
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:59,279
you know so

1480
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:02,640
so for me

1481
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:05,519
i am seeing that

1482
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:07,519
music and artistry and

1483
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,480
all that we do

1484
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:10,719
um

1485
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,000
you know has to evolve you know there is

1486
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:12,959
a saying

1487
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,559
that

1488
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,559
uh it's actually

1489
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:19,760
uh in a chanting tree proverb that say

1490
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,160
when

1491
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,920
uh the hunter learns to shoot

1492
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:25,940
without missing the birds will have to

1493
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,280
learn to fly without perching

1494
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:30,400
[Laughter]

1495
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,519
that means that whenever you're giving

1496
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,039
any

1497
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:35,838
situation you have to make the

1498
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,719
adjustment yeah yeah and elevate above

1499
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:38,558
it

1500
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:40,399
so i think that

1501
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,440
musicians have to now start being

1502
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,480
innovative yeah in terms of where they

1503
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,119
are

1504
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,318
and where they're situated and where is

1505
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,358
their

1506
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:53,279
natural

1507
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:55,679
places to be able to project globally to

1508
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,640
and there's a lot of tools right now to

1509
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,558
help

1510
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:59,920
that but it has not become

1511
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,920
the norm but

1512
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,680
with what is going on

1513
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,079
we have to

1514
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:07,279
work very fast to really

1515
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,280
um

1516
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,519
you know put a platform out there yeah

1517
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,760
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and it also

1518
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,358
makes some money exactly exactly you

1519
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,599
know virtual and interactive at the same

1520
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:18,480
time you know and i feel that that is

1521
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,119
where

1522
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,679
uh people have to

1523
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,160
push themselves too so that regardless

1524
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:28,480
of whatever it is you're not limited by

1525
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:29,679
geography because it's becoming very

1526
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,920
hard to

1527
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:34,159
navigate across

1528
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,760
borders and geography because people are

1529
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:37,440
becoming more divided around the world

1530
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,559
as we've seen

1531
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,960
nations are looking more inwards

1532
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,798
you know everybody you know even

1533
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,240
political stability

1534
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:51,599
is uh becoming a big question around the

1535
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:54,558
world yeah so all of these things impact

1536
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:57,200
the ability of musicians to travel and

1537
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:59,680
be able to showcase their artistry so we

1538
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:02,399
are the mercy of all these elements and

1539
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,239
i think that we also need to

1540
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,240
now start seeing things that the

1541
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:08,000
innovation doesn't necessarily come from

1542
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,479
other people doing it we need to

1543
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,510
innovate how we still are going to reach

1544
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,679
the people yeah

1545
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:15,359
[Music]

1546
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:17,038
um

1547
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:19,920
how many albums do you have

1548
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,039
i have seven albums and then one ep yeah

1549
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,200
um

1550
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:26,000
and then the new one get a new one the

1551
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,759
voice of bomb is the current uh ep

1552
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,119
that's out right now

1553
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,200
and

1554
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,200
branches of the same tree was nominated

1555
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,960
for a grammy for

1556
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,358
reggae album of the year yes really

1557
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,400
that's one year yeah yeah

1558
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:42,558
yeah it was like um

1559
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,318
i think i'm either the first or the

1560
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:47,359
second african

1561
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:50,000
to be nominated in that category yeah

1562
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:53,199
and then also the first of my country

1563
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,079
uh to be nominated for a grammy yeah so

1564
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:58,239
so that nomination for me

1565
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,400
was um you know i mean people like to

1566
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:03,919
use the word historic

1567
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:05,838
uh for it but i

1568
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,240
also saw it as a combination of you know

1569
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:10,880
when you're evolving a new sound was

1570
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:13,679
that the afro-root sound finally

1571
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,838
was able to grab the ears of people as

1572
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:16,960
to

1573
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:18,639
what um

1574
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,240
innovation that

1575
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,000
that sound had brought to contemporary

1576
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:23,759
reggae music at the same time too

1577
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,719
brought to contemporary high life and

1578
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,920
afrobeat music because what i did was

1579
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,798
fuse

1580
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,000
these two sounds in a way that could be

1581
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:33,280
accessible

1582
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,079
and also

1583
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,559
could speak in a way that everybody from

1584
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,160
every culture could access it

1585
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,240
and i think that the

1586
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:44,719
grammy nomination was

1587
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:45,519
an eventual validation of this sound

1588
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:47,919
that

1589
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:51,119
i have constantly championed

1590
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,639
