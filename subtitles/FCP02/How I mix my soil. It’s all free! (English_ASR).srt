1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,839
all right so I've got a blueberry

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,519
Chimera that I need to transplant that

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,280
is blueberry muffin cross to Chimera 2

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,759
and you've SE me make all my compost and

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,399
Imo fours and what I'm going to do is

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,798
make a longer video and just take you

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,280
with me and show you how I'm going to

8
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,920
make my soil first we're going to start

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,278
off with some of this fresh compost that

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,600
I just moved all my compost those two

11
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:26,079
bins over here to this Bend this bin

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,960
this bin is completely done and so I'm

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,278
going to need enough to fill up just a

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,799
small little pot like this both start

15
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:36,159
off with compost again I grow in compost

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,919
and I grow uh in imo3 which is basically

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,919
an IMO

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,039
4 so there's some good material right

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,879
there let's go to the

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,520
back and we're going to get IMO imo3

21
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,718
this is the acorn imo3 that I just made

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,719
right

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
here

24
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:12,359
take a look at it look at that

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,478
stick you can see looks really good lots

26
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,280
of

27
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,920
inoculation again about half and half

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,680
and what I do man whenever we're mixing

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,560
this up I'm just trying to make it look

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,520
like something that I would want to grow

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,478
in right something I'd want to grow

32
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,840
in I'll be adding some moisture to it by

33
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:31,840
adding

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:45,118
LF that looks like a good plate of soil

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,118
right there all right here we go head it

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,680
back might be raining

37
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,718

39
00:01:52,718 --> 00:02:00,959
afraid so there's my compost and

40
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,560
imo3 and why I say it's B basically ano4

41
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,919
is because I'm not cooking it I'm not

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,239
adding anything to it but this would be

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,920
what an im4 is made out of it's got

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,360
plenty of nutrients in it already it's
