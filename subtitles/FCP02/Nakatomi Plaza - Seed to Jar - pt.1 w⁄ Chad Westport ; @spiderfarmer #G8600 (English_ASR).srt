1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,679
okay

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:24,719
[Music]

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,599
all right here we are so again I just

4
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,598
germinated my seeds I got 10 out of 10

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,219
on the nakatomi plazas to pop and what

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,700
I'm doing is I'm taking them and I'm

7
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,579
putting them into some Royal Gold Kings

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,879
blend mix it's not super hot so it's not

9
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,960
gonna burn these fresh seedlings but it

10
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:44,699
is going to give them a little bit of

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,799
food and I like to start them out in

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,840
these little four inch containers so

13
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,599
that's what I'm doing right now I'm just

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,000
loading everything in I got my tag so I

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,739
can mark them my pen and I got my

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
tweezers I like handling them with

17
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:59,339
tweezers instead of my fingers just a

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
little bit easier to pick them up and

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,239
then you know whoop and then put them

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,780
into uh

21
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,399
the soil here got my measuring cup I'm

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,000
starting them off with about 50

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,740
milliliters of water uh uh yeah that's

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
the beginning of their Journey for the

25
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,459
nakatomi plazas let's put one in the

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,060
soil together pretty simple process

27
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:25,139
start get my tag take this out we're on

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:29,040
number five right now so you

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,280
are number five booyah

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,380
put this into my soil

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,299
and I'm gonna make a little divot with

32
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,280
my pinky for the seed you don't need to

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,040
go deep again the general rule of thumb

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,960
is so just about the width of the seed

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,000
is how deep you want to go with it that

36
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,679
applies almost any seed we're doing

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,299
cannabis seeds so I'm going to take it

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,979
about a quarter of an inch down now see

39
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,560
what I did is I grabbed it

40
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:55,140
in my little tweezers here put it in the

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,879
soil again we're putting that white tip

42
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,140
down we're putting the shell head up

43
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,500
that's the way it's going to want to

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,159
grow out I am gently covering it here

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,319
with soil give it a little tap

46
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,719
come back with my 50 milliliters of

47
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,359
water I'm going to start off just kind

48
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,340
of around where I place the seed

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,379
and then I'm gonna go right on top of

50
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,060
where I place my seed I'm not watering

51
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:20,340
the whole thing at this point it's only

52
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,640
50 milliliters of water so I'm getting

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,098
the area right around the seed nice and

54
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,839
wet to keep it germinating and to keep

55
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:30,000
it growing its tail I don't want to

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,159
suffocate it but I also don't want it to

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,039
be too dry so I'll keep my eye on that

58
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:39,780
checking back in with the nakatomi plaza

59
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:42,719
10 test beans uh these is or this is day

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,098
nine now of these plants and as you can

61
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,199
see they're still numbered they're going

62
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:49,979
through uh you know it looks like number

63
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:53,639
two might have the most growth as far as

64
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:56,039
Leaf spread goes on uh but you look down

65
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,859
here you know you got number eight and

66
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:02,219
you got number ten those look like the

67
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,739
tall ones of the bunch everybody is

68
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,979
going pretty good pretty much on the

69
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:12,539
same Pace number nine though number nine

70
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:16,500
is the runt so this is how the nakatomi

71
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:19,679
plaza seeds are looking on day nine day

72
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,658
15. this is how the nakatomi plazas are

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,340
looking we still got some that are

74
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:26,219
taller than others but again we're about

75
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,620
to transplant them into one gallon

76
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,900
containers and we're gonna soak up some

77
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,239
of this space you know from from the

78
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,640
soil up to the first cotyleated so these

79
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,280
will actually look a bit shorter here in

80
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,039
a minute but uh yeah you know they're

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,979
all fairly level nine is still kind of

82
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,579
the runt uh eight

83
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:51,060
and 10 are pretty tall number two is

84
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,819
looking nice and squat but uh this is

85
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,519
how things are looking day 15 on the

86
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:58,679
nakatomi plazas about to give them some

87
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,719
water and put them into their one gallon

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,019
container we are checking in with the

89
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,658
nakatomi plaza this is day 29 starting

90
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,939
to see some similarities in morphology

91
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:11,938
uh we'll go in for a closer look but

92
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,979
let's take a look from above and you can

93
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:17,060
kind of see here everything oh let me

94
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,060
turn on my autofocus

95
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,639
but these are in one gallon containers

96
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,079
uh in the Soho living soil and again 29

97
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,040
days they've been sitting under these

98
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:31,978
the spider farmer s uh f1000

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,740
so 100 watt light 100 watt light it's

100
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:37,500
only at 60 percent and as you can see

101
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,060
it's you know

102
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,478
well above

103
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,240
the actual plants but you know plants

104
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,099
don't need as much light and veg uh

105
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,780
giving them a little less light is kind

106
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,300
of a way to control the speed of their

107
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,739
growth as well and I've been doing that

108
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,199
a little just trying to juggle things

109
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,939
here y'all know about rotation but

110
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,520
things are getting freed up

111
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,500
um I might up pot these soon but I also

112
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,839
I might keep these into one gallons

113
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,899
we'll see but anyways this is a nakatomi

114
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,939
Plaza's day 29. hey everybody Chad

115
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:11,698
Westport here with another update on the

116
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,740
nakatomi Plaza tester group I put 10

117
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,199
seeds in and I've got 10 growing right

118
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,660
now let's kind of take a real quick

119
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:22,500
panoramic view there's stacked you know

120
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,479
too deep here uh five per row let's go

121
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,279
in for a closer look though at this

122
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,579
nakatomi Plaza this is kind of a good

123
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,859
aerial view of the nakatomi plazas and

124
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:35,219
they're at about eighth or ninth node

125
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,319
I'm already starting to see what will be

126
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,820
the determining factor for sex on a few

127
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,339
plants I know I got one female in there

128
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,680
already another week they'll reveal

129
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,959
itself more but as you can see you know

130
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,478
fairly uniform as far as you know height

131
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,219
goes morphology and structure some are a

132
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,099
little bit tighter on the inner node

133
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,620
spacing some are a little bit looser

134
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,479
but again relatively all the same height

135
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,399
which is helpful in the garden when

136
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,079
you're planting a whole bunch of seeds

137
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,719
two things that I wanted to point out

138
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,240
though as far as the question of did you

139
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,820
see anything different or funny

140
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
um not really I did get a dragon Leaf

141
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,639
though a dragon's tongue look at that

142
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,620
that's kind of cool and you can see

143
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,680
right here where it just split into two

144
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,439
I flip it over to the back side and

145
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,720
again you just see you know it's again I

146
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,019
call that the uh the dragon tongue Leaf

147
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,479
but Dragon tongue leaf on one plant

148
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:30,120
and on this Leaf you kind of see how the

149
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:33,478
other half of it didn't really form here

150
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,699
a little mutant Leaf but again this is

151
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,279
the only leaf on this plant like that

152
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,259
and these genetic type of things they

153
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,739
just happen so I'm not very worried

154
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,720
about it uh fairly common actually and

155
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,699
plant number nine which was the runt

156
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,280
from the beginning it's totally caught

157
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,080
up with all of the other plants and it's

158
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,758
actually sitting a little bit lower in

159
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,399
the soil so it looks maybe an inch or

160
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,319
two shorter but there's less soil in the

161
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,299
pot so really it's the same height as

162
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,979
everything else so they're right fully

163
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,840
caught up so what I'm going to do now is

164
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:05,639
I'm just going to go in and defoliate

165
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,099
I'm going to remove all of these large

166
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,560
fan leaves because I want like getting

167
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,180
to the branches stretching below and

168
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,220
again because this is just a grow out

169
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,319
it's a test grow I want to see how it

170
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,660
grows for you or well I want you guys to

171
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,919
see how it grows naturally uh I'm not

172
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,180
going to do any training or anything

173
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,060
like that just a little light

174
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,180
defoliation and let the plant do its

175
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,180
thing

176
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:36,839
hey everybody Chad Westport here we're

177
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,060
checking back in with the nakatomi plaza

178
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,519
test grow and I just got back from a

179
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,000
week in Mexico and you know what that

180
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:48,538
means my plants look [ __ ]

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,459
okay so as you can see here Haggard you

182
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:53,598
think after the month in the Netherlands

183
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:56,879
and losing plants I would have learned

184
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:59,699
but I really didn't think the person

185
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,199
watching the place could do this in just

186
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,319
a week's time

187
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,180
but they did now after Netherlands I had

188
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,060
bought the auto pot so I wouldn't have

189
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,720
to worry about things like this again

190
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:14,759
well yeah but I also didn't have these

191
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,400
plants mature enough to be in the auto

192
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,919
pots yet so it was still a hand watering

193
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,538
system and here we are uh we'll go in

194
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,378
for a closer look at the Leafs but I

195
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:24,839
also want to show you something

196
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,460
interesting about how I've noticed these

197
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,258
deficiencies were actually probably lock

198
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,439
out because of freaking bad watering

199
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:34,918
practices uh has shown up on these

200
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,139
plants so let me explain for you first a

201
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,500
general look over all of the plants real

202
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,500
quickly

203
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:48,059
no vacations

204
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:52,859
all right so my interesting observation

205
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:54,359
is this we see this side which is under

206
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,759
the light

207
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,740
looks a little bit well [ __ ] it is

208
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,519
Haggard sorry I swore there but it is

209
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,379
it's Haggard but if you look at the

210
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,879
other side of the plant actually let me

211
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,240
just quickly demonstrate this so this is

212
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,879
the side that's under the light right

213
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,500
not looking good

214
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:18,320
that's the side that's under the light

215
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,320
now the side that is away from the light

216
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,639
you're looking pretty green like you

217
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:29,160
don't have any of the same damage

218
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,958
you actually kind of look healthy

219
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,958
but the side that was under the light

220
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,879
has the deficiencies or the lockout so

221
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,759
why is that

222
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:45,299
is it the light that is causing this

223
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,580
is it the photosynthesis process of the

224
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,620
extra light that's causing this

225
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,139
is it potentially the extra

226
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,019
transpiration from these leaves drawing

227
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:58,019
in more nutrients or if it's locked out

228
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:01,440
lack of because it's photosynthesizing

229
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,480
more than the side that was over here in

230
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,120
the kind of the Shaded area

231
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,920
why is that why is one half of the plant

232
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,659
looking so Haggard and the other plant

233
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,659
half of the plant looking good

234
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:17,278
inquiring minds want to know and just to

235
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,740
show that these are repeatable results

236
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,179
you know again this one under the light

237
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,600
in the corner

238
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:27,299
the side that's not in it well it looks

239
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,540
nice and green okay so let's go to this

240
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:34,439
next one dude Haggard look at that

241
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:36,719
no bueno so I was in Mexico that showed

242
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,480
up it's directly under the light there

243
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,620
but again if I flip to the back side the

244
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,620
kind of the shadowy side

245
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,980
it's a lot more green

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,899
so the sides that were under the light

247
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,539
Haggard

248
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,519
the side that was in the corner and not

249
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,719
getting the direct light

250
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,220
green

251
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,079
interesting

252
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,639
a lot of times that people start to see

253
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,679
little brown spots on their leaves

254
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,500
they'll think oh calcium that's the

255
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,879
issue and in a lot of cases that is but

256
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,620
that's not what we're looking at here

257
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,620
this do have brown spots and this is

258
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,440
actually very Advanced stage but we're

259
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,740
looking at likely is a phosphorus

260
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,399
deficiency and it's not a deficiency in

261
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:24,060
the soil it has been locked out because

262
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,399
of over watering so how am I going to

263
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:29,338
correct all these things let me tell you

264
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,799
well we know this happened because too

265
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,720
much water in the root Zone they're also

266
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,819
getting a little bit large now for these

267
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,278
one gallon pots so what I'm going to do

268
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,820
is I'm going to up pot them that is

269
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:43,559
going to kind of help the soil dry out a

270
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,200
little bit kind of find an equilibrium

271
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,518
with its new soil that will help the

272
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
root Zone that's going to bring in some

273
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,839
more oxygen and then I should be able to

274
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,300
get proper watering back on track I'm

275
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,920
also going to defoliate the large fan

276
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,078
leaves the ones that are looking Haggard

277
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,659
and and you know even the green ones too

278
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,719
it's about that time I'm gonna hold off

279
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:06,419
on doing some cutting of the lower

280
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,800
branches just because I want this to get

281
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,719
through the stress it's currently under

282
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,759
I wanted to get through the transplant

283
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,700
and I wanted to handle the defoliation

284
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,639
so not going to toss too much at it but

285
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:22,100
as somebody who's testing genetics this

286
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:25,439
is a great but unintended test of their

287
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,899
solidness so yes you can thank the

288
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,360
person who were watching these while I

289
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:34,320
was gone in Mexico for this unintended

290
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,659
torture test but thank you everybody for

291
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,300
