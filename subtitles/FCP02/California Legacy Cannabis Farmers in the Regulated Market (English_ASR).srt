challenges they face we talk about the

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,280
equity grant program and the

28
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,959
difficulties it is having due to

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,599
mismanagement and understaffing in

30
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,919
mendocino county katz has many years of

31
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,640
experience in the cannabis industry

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,159
and the pr industry as well and is the

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,079
mca's first full-time executive director

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,320

35
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,719

36
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,399
cannabis alliance how are you michael

37
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,560

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,840
it's great to have you man and thanks

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,040
for appearing

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,159
um

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,079
so

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
first question who is the mendocino

43
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,399
cannabis alliance

44
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,319
sure so the mendocino cannabis alliance

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,520
is the premier cannabis trade

46
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:49,039
association in mendocino county it was

47
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,679
founded in 2019 a coming together of two

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,640
different trade groups in mendocino one

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,399
that was focused primarily on business

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,718
development economic development getting

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,519
the mendocino name out into the world as

52
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,839
far as quality of products and branding

53
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,560
and marketing and the other one was

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,520
focused more on local and state policy

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,479
advocacy efforts and so those two

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,120
organizations combined to form mca in

57
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,919
2019 i was fortunate enough to have

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,080
moved to mendocino in 2018 and been

59
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,359
involved as a founding board member in

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,599
that organization and then uh came on as

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,400
full-time executive director in november

62
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,759
of 2020 we represent uh

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,000
over 130 individual small businesses

64
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,919
the vast majority of which are licensed

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,039
small cannabis cultivators here in

66
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:41,439
mendocino but we also have members who

67
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,400
are in other sectors we represent

68
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,000
several retailers and distributors just

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,959
folks throughout the cannabis supply

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,959
chain

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,439
and folks who want to see

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,560
our cannabis communities survive and

73
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,840
thrive in this challenging time so um we

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
have great members we have great

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,400
sponsors who help to support our efforts

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,280
and you know we're

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,439
fortunate to be able to have a full-time

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,598
executive director which is me uh

79
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,359
working to advocate on behalf of our

80
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,000
members uh because there's a lot going

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,599
on and and it's hard for folks who are

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,519
farming and who are involved in the

83
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,598
other challenging parts of the cannabis

84
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,719
business to focus on all of these things

85
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:23,439
at once yeah i hear you and the reason

86
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,280
we're talking today is pretty much taxes

87
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,639
and we'll get to that in a minute

88
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,360
so

89
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,439
now

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,959
you're the mendocino cannabis alliance

91
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:37,199
what is the mendocino cannabis program

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,319
so the mendocino cannabis program is the

93
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:44,079
county department that administers the

94
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:47,039
mendocino uh cannabis program

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,840
which is which is the program through

96
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,400
which

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,878
our licensed operators have been

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,200
entering into compliance so

99
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,759
their the program opened and accepted

100
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,318
applications from people who had

101
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,798
previously been cultivating cannabis

102
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,919
throughout the county and then those

103
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,920
operators have been in this uh

104
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,039
application

105
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,039
gauntlet since then four years four and

106
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,359
a half years many of them

107
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,680
still trying to get to a county annual

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,479
permit but the program has changed

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,560
departments several times it began in ag

110
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,719
they were accepting paper applications

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,280
at that time then it moved to planning

112
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,199
and building services and that they'll

113
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,799
you know there's a lot of lost

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
applications and

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,840
people having to submit four or five

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,918
times the same paperwork uh and so this

117
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,799
is the latest iteration of how the

118
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,959
county is managing cannabis and uh it is

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,319
a stand been made into a standalone

120
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,799
department uh and so they are kind of in

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,159
charge of administering the cannabis

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,439
program on behalf of the board of

123
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,639
supervisors

124
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,040
right

125
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,280
okay so we're gonna come back to them

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
but let's go on to last week there so

127
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,319
last week there was a protest in

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,079
sacramento to bring attention to the

129
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,959
strain on farmers in the industry in

130
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,439
general caused by the what cultivation

131
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,399
tax and tax in general right

132
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,879
sure so it was uh the the rally last

133
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,478
week was put on primarily by supernova

134
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:20,319
women which is uh an equity advocacy

135
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:23,439
group based out of the bay area and we

136
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:27,759
uh as mca were able to participate

137
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:30,319
because origins council who is our state

138
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,319
level advocacy organization made up of

139
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,439
trade associations from six different

140
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,918
heritage cultivating regions was a part

141
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,240
of organizing but at the lead of

142
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,519
supernova women and so there were two

143
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,360
primary requests at the rally last week

144
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:51,359
one was a removal of the cultivation tax

145
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,639
and one was uh a removal of the excise

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,120
tax for equity retailers uh throughout

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,720
the state and so you know those are

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,918
there two areas where we see

149
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,319
extensive taxation that does not occur

150
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,399
in the unlicensed market that is you

151
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,039
know really putting the license market

152
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,918
behind oh yeah and at a competitive

153
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,959
disadvantage and so you know the the

154
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,560
equity community the people of color uh

155
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,799
and the bipac community who have

156
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,199
struggled severely at the hands of the

157
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,319
war on drugs have a lot in common in

158
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,879
that arena with the small operators who

159
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,120
have been subject to the war on drugs as

160
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,439
cultivators in the northern california

161
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,680
region you know humble the mendocino

162
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,478
have some of the most uh

163
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,720
examples of paramilitary activity uh

164
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,680
towards the eradication of cannabis uh

165
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
in the state and so you know ongoing to

166
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000
this day

167
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,440
ongoing you know sadly um and so there

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,279
is you know there's still a lot of

169
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,319
issues to be worked out but it was it

170
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,799
was very

171
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,479
uh uplifting and inspiring to see these

172
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,360
communities come together at the state

173
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,959
capitol and call for this essential tax

174
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,879
change together

175
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,879
and so for our listeners can you just

176
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,439
tell us how much is

177
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:11,120
the cultivators tax per ounce

178
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:14,560
so right now uh per pound of cannabis

179
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,199
it's about a dollar it's about 160 a

180
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,478
little bit over 160 dollars per pound

181
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,478
and that went up just this when the new

182
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:25,439
year started it went up from what was

183
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:28,879
about 155 dollars

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:32,719
and so that tax is actually tied to

185
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:35,120
inflation and whereas a year ago

186
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,919
when or more than a year ago when it was

187
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,360
being considered to implement that

188
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:44,478
increase of tax it was not increased

189
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,199
this year the increase went ahead and so

190
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,839
unfortunately because of the

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
corresponding market crash what it means

192
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,959
right now is that that tax of 160

193
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,000
dollars which maybe that used to be on

194
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,638
product that was selling for anywhere uh

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,959
at a thousand dollars a pound or over

196
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,000
you know so that's still a 15 you know

197
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,478
15 to 20 percent tax right there has now

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,639
shifted to since product is available is

199
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,959
selling on the market for between three

200
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,680
and five hundred dollars in some cases

201
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,478
we're looking at a fifty percent tax

202
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,038
uh on that product and so that's

203
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,360
unsustainable it would be unsustainable

204
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,000
in any industry but it's particularly

205
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,800
unsustainable in light of all the other

206
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,720
fees and licensing requirements that are

207
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,038
put upon these operators and

208
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,879
specifically in mendocino county none of

209
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,679
these cultivators have sites larger than

210
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,799
10 000 square feet so it's the smallest

211
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,879
of the small cultivation that is still

212
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,958
being treated like the largest of the

213
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,120
large and they don't have the resources

214
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,679
and they don't have the runway to you

215
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,519
know wait this out yeah and uh they

216
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,519
don't take into account the law of

217
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,120
supply and demand on the price

218
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,959
with the tax so it's just a fixed tax

219
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,839
yes and that's a challenge for us in

220
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,639
mendocino as well uh in our local tax

221
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,519
ordinance we have guaranteed minimum

222
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,399
requirements owed to the st owed to the

223
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,519
county

224
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,000
uh annually and so you know if you have

225
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,120
a 10 000 square foot permit but you're

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,120
only cultivating 5 000 square feet

227
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,399
you're still responsible to pay the full

228
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,120
minimum tax on the 10 000 square feet

229
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,039
whether or not you you are even

230
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,839
able to sell that product whether that

231
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,639
product experiences crop loss that tax

232
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,360
is just required to participate in the

233
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,439
program but the payment of that tax has

234
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,959
not resulted in any real services or

235
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,480
support for the folks who have been

236
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,199
paying it

237
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,680
and is there any other agricultural

238
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,399
product that has cultivator tax

239
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,599
not that we're aware of no yeah

240
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,919
and

241
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,639
okay that's kind of

242
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,639
unfair and so the excise tax then is

243
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,120
also your ex asking for that to be

244
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,360
removed as well yeah so the excise tax

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,000
is interesting because it comes at the

246
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,360
end of the supply chain but it has to be

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,519
paid before the product actually is sold

248
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,079
right so when a distributor is

249
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,200
transferring a product to a retailer

250
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:18,958
they're responsible to pay in advance

251
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,759
this 15 excise tax and it's either based

252
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,919
on a complicated formula if it's uh

253
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,399
wholesale pricing or a slightly less

254
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,319
complicated formula if it's retail

255
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,120
pricing but it breaks down to roughly a

256
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,839
wholesale product is going to be

257
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,560
marked up 27 percent to cover the excise

258
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,040
tax and the price the price at retail

259
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,719
winds up being marked up about 15 but

260
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,958
the result of this and all of these

261
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,120
taxes that we're talking about wind up

262
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,000
with prices to the consumer that are you

263
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,560
know 30 to 50 percent higher than

264
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,519
they're paying in the unregulated market

265
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:56,399
and so when we're guessing or estimating

266
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,200
that maybe there are you know eight or

267
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,159
nine

268
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,600
illicit shops compared to one license

269
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,679
shop and those options are providing way

270
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,839
discounted prices with products that to

271
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,078
uneducated consumers just look like

272
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,600
licensed cannabis products you're

273
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,319
putting the licensed community at

274
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,680
incredible disadvantage especially when

275
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,480
the intent of prop 64 as it was voted in

276
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,679
by

277
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,560
the people of california was to provide

278
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,199
a sustainable transition for these like

279
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,679
these existing businesses and to create

280
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,839
a california cannabis industry of small

281
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,120
and medium-sized businesses right now

282
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
instead what we're seeing is an

283
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,600
extinction event after extinction event

284
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,680
of these smaller businesses and if

285
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,680
there's not drastic measures taken soon

286
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,359
at the county and state levels we're

287
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,359
going to see a lot more people have to

288
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,440
leave the licensed market

289
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,519
and the black market is thriving at

290
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,360
least it is down here i got to tell you

291
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,000
i've you know in my

292
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
in the course of my job i've

293
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,440
tried to get interviews with some of

294
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,200
these people there's illegal distro

295
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,519
warehouses where there's

296
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,000
thousands of pounds moving you know with

297
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,240
several different distributors

298
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,839
sure yeah well first i just like to

299
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,799
recommend um you know uh it words uh are

300
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,600
so impactful these days we tend to try

301
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,039
to

302
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,120
uh not use the term black market because

303
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,278
we find that it contributes actually to

304
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,200
a culture of white supremacy like the

305
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,958
idea that like black market bad white

306
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,120
market good right right so you know

307
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,599
terms like illicit market unregulated

308
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,159
market traditional market just as a

309
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,440
general uh you know word across that out

310
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,719
of my question

311
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,519
yeah and then

312
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,360
yeah listed traditional unregulated

313
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,600
but yeah the the truth is that the

314
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,600
unregulated market has you know a

315
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,360
fraction of the

316
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,959
resource has a fraction of the

317
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,519
restrictions and bottlenecks that are

318
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,359
placed on folks in the licensed market

319
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,039
and as you point out i mean there have

320
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,919
been articles that have come out about

321
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,879
these so-called burner distros where

322
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,120
folks full well are operating businesses

323
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,278
that are not intending to be compliant

324
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,839
and you know ultimately potentially

325
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,078
impacting small operators who are

326
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,880
because as you know as we know as you

327
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,479
may know uh it's the distributor who's

328
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,519
responsible for remitting the

329
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,159
cultivation tax from the small farmer to

330
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,399
the state so if a distributor is

331
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,399
operating illegally and not remitting

332
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,799
that taxation ultimately that can come

333
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,320
back to harm the small operator and from

334
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,199
the articles that have been out there it

335
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,920
seems that this is uh there's awareness

336
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,639
that this is happening but there's very

337
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,679
little being done to to stop it you know

338
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,879
and so

339
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:41,198
we have been advocating for more and

340
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,600
more direct access opportunities for our

341
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,679
small farmers not to have to go through

342
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,240
this very convoluted expensive and

343
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,799
unreliable supply chain and be able like

344
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,919
any other small farmer in any other crop

345
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,519
or industry or sector to be able to sell

346
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,759
directly to consumers what they're

347
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,919
cultivating you know cannabis small

348
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,480
cannabis farmers uh

349
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,719
any cannabis farmer who can't afford uh

350
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,680
to set up a retail license

351
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
is

352
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,000
basically unable to

353
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
receive the full

354
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
value of their product at market they

355
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,240
are

356
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,639
by necessity required to work through

357
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,399
this entire supply chain that separates

358
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,680
them from the consumer and separates

359
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,720
them from the value that they're

360
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,278
producing and it's creating this uh you

361
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,160
know this untenable and unsustainable

362
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,399
situation yeah well wineries can sell

363
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,198
directly to the consumer you go to a

364
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,519
wine tasting event at the winery and you

365
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,069
can buy the wine right there right so

366
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,440
sure

367
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:44,480
[Music]

368
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,560
yeah sorry about that rural living it's

369
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,720
okay i just kept rolling what the hell

370
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,759
i'll edit that out later

371
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,879
so

372
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,720
yeah i was i was just kind of like

373
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,320
throwing out that rhetorical question i

374
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,399
mean the california wouldn't put up with

375
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,399
an illicit alcohol market right

376
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
sure well i mean i think that it is

377
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,479
important to note that we are still at

378
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,720
the very beginning of the end of

379
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,159
cannabis prohibition like cannabis right

380
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,879
prohibition exists we are not outside of

381
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,759
that paradigm just because we have a

382
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:21,039
state regulated program it's still not

383
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,838
legal in any uh meaningful sense i mean

384
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,879
there are there have been reductions in

385
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,920
criminal

386
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,159
charges that can be filed but that has

387
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,639
not solved the problem of people of

388
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,919
color being incarcerated at greater

389
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,480
numbers because of cannabis uh than not

390
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:41,519
and so you know we're still not seeing

391
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,920
the social justice or racial justice

392
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,600
that we would want to see from a truly

393
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:50,000
legalized cannabis community and so

394
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,000
uh yeah the the struggles that we face

395
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,039
are substantial and they're based

396
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
largely on that fact so it took a while

397
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,000
for

398
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,759
direct sales of alcohol you know that

399
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,919
was the thing too it didn't happen

400
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,360
immediately and yeah the cannabis

401
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,759
industry has many different uh voices in

402
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,000
it who are representing many different

403
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,879
constituencies you know we have the

404
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,039
small operators the legacy operators

405
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,360
we're trying to make the transition into

406
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:20,319
the new market you have the that

407
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,639
includes in both you know the rural and

408
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,278
urban areas of the state

409
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,278
all of whom were negatively impacted by

410
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,799
the war on drugs and continue to be to

411
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,679
this day

412
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,719
but you also have the kind of new

413
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,559
industry the outside capital the more

414
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,278
traditional business interests that are

415
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,838
trying to capitalize on a perceived

416
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,799
green rush and what that has done you

417
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,720
know with the oversupply and the the the

418
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,439
fact that the one acre cap that was

419
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:54,000
built into prop 64 was never

420
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,440
uh enforced or or in or made reality um

421
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,039
you know what we're seeing that right

422
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,839
now with the crash in the market and

423
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,639
unfortunately it hasn't led to

424
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,919
lower prices for consumers either

425
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,480
and it hasn't led to uh a reduction in

426
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,640
the illicit market and so you know it's

427
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,360
important to take a really

428
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,839
50 000 foot view of this system and see

429
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,639
how challenged it is and

430
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,318
we

431
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,919
and the different constituencies

432
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,759
certainly have different opinions on how

433
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,679
things should go and so it's really

434
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,160
about working with legislators and

435
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,919
regulators and trying to push the needle

436
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,120
in the right direction for for our

437
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,000
communities

438
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,319
and

439
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,599
how successful do you think your efforts

440
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,240
are going to be with getting rid of

441
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,759
those two taxes the excise and the the

442
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,000
cultivators tax

443
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,640
well i think that there is definitely

444
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,359
been a appetite expressed by the

445
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,480
governor's office for tax reform in

446
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,240
cannabis

447
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
uh you know it's it's a really

448
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,240
challenging time historically when it

449
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,320
comes to tax reform in cannabis in

450
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,720
california specifically around the

451
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:00,159
cultivation tax uh the challenge has

452
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,240
been that that money is earmarked

453
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,640
towards certain uses

454
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,319
and so the groups that align with those

455
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,240
uses you know labor uh for example um

456
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,000
are very

457
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,079
it's very important to them to make sure

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,240
that revenues that they have come to

459
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,639
count on are not decreased so that's you

460
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,519
know the in the governor's messaging you

461
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,000
know we understand that there's a desire

462
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,160
to address this but they're looking at

463
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,640
also having to maintain revenue

464
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,960
neutrality which is you know you know

465
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,679
somewhat of a challenge yeah we we're

466
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,480
hopeful that due to the budget surplus

467
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,360
the year-on-year budget surplus and the

468
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,759
fact that there is uh you know all of

469
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,399
these resources available that in order

470
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,279
to

471
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,759
save

472
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,359
this community that is so endangered

473
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,079
right now it's the

474
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,479
uh the heart and the backbone of

475
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,038
california's cannabis industry uh

476
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,038
drastic actions need to be taken so you

477
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,679
know we understand that there are

478
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,839
important goals and that it's important

479
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,480
to weigh them with the realities on the

480
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,399
ground and make sure that we don't lose

481
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,720
this industry before it's too late to

482
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,679
save it

483
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,640
well

484
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,798
it

485
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,759
seems to be in danger i noticed that

486
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,679
that

487
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,440
media is reporting the cannabis industry

488
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,440
is on the verge of collapse due to over

489
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,840
taxation where do you think we go from

490
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,279
here to solve this problem michael

491
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,480
well i think it's a combination of

492
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,480
things you know it is the state level uh

493
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,960
and there will be legislation that's

494
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,599
coming out for this year that is going

495
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,440
to address many of these topics you know

496
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,439
uh they're they're they're the

497
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
legislators and the regulators are very

498
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,480
aware of the challenges we have been

499
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,639
very vocal about our pain points at one

500
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,240
point the state uh was very clear about

501
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,720
asking for those and so we've been

502
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,798
providing them obviously there have been

503
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,600
there was a rally in sacramento last

504
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,480
week

505
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:58,959

506
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:02,000
with the dcc and cdfw and um you know

507
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,919

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,120
six different trade associations and

512
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,400

big sur trinity sonoma and mendocino and

514
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,720

515
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,360
cannabis advocacy organization in the

516
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,679
state and so origins council is working

517
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,079
diligently on these key points because

518
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,960
they really affect hundreds and hundreds

519
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,879
and honestly thousands of stakeholders

520
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,200
that are in the licensed market right

521
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,280
now that are you know really need the

522
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,600
support of the state to be able to make

523
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,079
it through this transition yeah

524
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,918
well it's in the origins council they

525
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,199

00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,918
sure so yeah janine coleman who's the

529
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,919
executive director of the origins

530
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,038
council she is a co-founder of the

531
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,159
mendocino appellations project and was

532
00:20:55,038 --> 00:21:00,879
integral in the working groups uh with

533
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,039
cdfw and the california growers

534
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,520
association uh

535
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,599
discussing appalachians and so yeah

536
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,440
origins council has been uh and the

537
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,918
leadership they're in have been a

538
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,400
strong voices in advocating for this

539
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,880
program and we're excited to see uh

540
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,120
certain uh regulatory uh updates being

541
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,600
considered you know the goal is not to

542
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,798
rush to market with uh this program the

543
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,519
goal is to

544
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,839
bring it in with all of the appropriate

545
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,639
safeguards make sure it's it's really

546
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:35,918
viewed uh internationally and

547
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,000
nationally as as the as a real thorough

548
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,159
program based on internationally

549
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,839
accepted standards yeah uh that will

550
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,480
give it some teeth you know and really

551
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,399
be able to put increased value behind

552
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,640
the products of our communities that we

553
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,440
already know are so valuable yeah that's

554
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,559
cool

555
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,159
so coming back to mendocino

556
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,558
what about the equity grant program

557
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,960
funds and who are they

558
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,558
designated for and

559
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,240
how is that going

560
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:07,519
sure so the the local equity program

561
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,679
is funded by the state and the equity

562
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,240
programs statewide are designed to

563
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,200
address negative impacts from the war on

564
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,319
drugs

565
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
and so

566
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,599
every county

567
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,359
or municipality has the opportunity to

568
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,158
provide to the state what's called a

569
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,439
needs assessment to determine what is

570
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,600
the need of the community how much uh

571
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,600
how much impact has the war on drugs had

572
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,839
to this community and what are their

573
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,558
needs to be able to try to alleviate

574
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:39,199
some of that damage and so through that

575
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,038
process which was spurred greatly by mca

576
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,440
our organization and

577
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:47,200
hannah nelson who is a

578
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,480
mca senior policy advisor and also just

579
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,038
a decades-long advocate uh in the legal

580
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,798
realm for civil rights and yeah i read

581
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,480
some of her writing

582
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,480
yeah she's she's an incredible

583
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,159
incredible advocate and our community is

584
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,798
truly lucky to have her

585
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,760
um and so

586
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,879
we

587
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,879
um

588
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,919
had put forward

589
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,360
uh proposals as a community uh through

590
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,520
mca as to how the equity program uh

591
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,678
should be administered and ultimately

592
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,960
the county went with uh some different

593
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,200
suggest different uh a route and to this

594
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,679
point there have been several edits made

595
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,759
to the program but unfortunately there

596
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,759
the funds that are earmarked to be

597
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,158
distributed uh among

598
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,879
our community have yet to be distributed

599
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,480
so there have been there are several

600
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,200
rounds of funding

601
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,000
our county was granted 2.2 million

602
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,558
dollars in the initial funding round and

603
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,440
to this point uh not only have none of

604
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,720
those funds actually been distributed

605
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,519
but it's

606
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,360
possible that by the end of february the

607
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,440
state has the ability to pull those

608
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,119
funds back if they have not actually

609
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,519
been provided to equity operators and so

610
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,439
we have been advocating for the removal

611
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,480
of barriers to get those funds

612
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,400
distributed

613
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,440
but you know certainly right now the

614
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,600
goal of the equity program is not being

615
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,600
met because the funds that are they're

616
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,519
not the county's funds they're the state

617
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,519
funds that are earmarked for these

618
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:22,000
individuals and the the program to

619
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:25,839
disperse them as set up by the county

620
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,880
has proven to be uh you know

621
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,678
yeah unable to meet the task at hand and

622
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,440
so

623
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,519
while there are people who have been

624
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,278
involved since february of last year in

625
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,278
this application process who still have

626
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,359
not seen a nickel and are still being

627
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,679
asked to resubmit documents yeah and

628
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,240
this is the mendocino uh cannabis

629
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,798
program uh administrators it's a

630
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,919
combination so the mendocino county

631
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,119
hired an outside group called elevate

632
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,480
impact

633
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,798
and they are the group that's the

634
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,440
external administrator now they

635
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,519
receive payment for their services

636
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,038
whether or not our grant funds are

637
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:06,319
distributed to my understanding uh and

638
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:08,319
about 10 of the grant funds is

639
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,000
allowed to be provided to the

640
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,119
administration of it so it's a

641
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,079
combination of that that outside entity

642
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:18,239
working uh with the mendocino cannabis

643
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,558
program but then beyond that there's

644
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,720
also the county council and the

645
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,639
different departments within the county

646
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,120
risk assessment all these different

647
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,559
things that are you know kind of

648
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,558
responsible to create this this chain to

649
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,879
enable the release of funds and

650
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,359
unfortunately it came to our attention

651
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,720
that that process to develop those

652
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,719
agreements even was not begun until it

653
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,360
was time to start giving them out to

654
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,720
applicants yeah and so we're behind the

655
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,278
eight ball uh a hundred percent and

656
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,839
really need swift action to make sure

657
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,880
that these funds are not lost and that

658
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:59,599
future funds that come in are able to be

659
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,278
distributed in a in a in an efficient

660
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,359
and effective way so they can meet the

661
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,599
goals of the program so did i hear this

662
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,000
correctly so the the outside entity that

663
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,399
came in to administer the program

664
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
gets like 250 grand to administer to the

665
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
program whether they even give out any

666
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,359
money or not

667
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,759
that's that's the agreement that they

668
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,918
have is that they are able to

669
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,519
you know receive up to 10 of the grant

670
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,080
funds to administer the program they

671
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,000
have several grant administrators

672
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:29,278
working on underwriters working on the

673
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,079
program uh you know emailing with the

674
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:34,400
applicants but there have been no direct

675
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,399
grant funds released

676
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,278
and what's the name of that entity uh

677
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,278
that is uh their elevate impact

678
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,519
men and the you know in in mendocino

679
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,558
county the website is elevate impact

680
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,440
mendo

681
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:50,319
uh and in you know they also apparently

682
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,679
uh operate equity programs in other

683
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,359
jurisdictions i'm not 100 familiar uh

684
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,200
what their track records are there you

685
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,599
know it's they're they're all very nice

686
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
people but we have yet to see any money

687
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,359
actually hit there hit the hands of the

688
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,000
applicants and it's certainly not all on

689
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,479
them it's a it's a function of the

690
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,798
county's program being understaffed

691
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,640
unfortunately you know unprepared to

692
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,839
address this as it was coming in with

693
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,679
all of the other things that are

694
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:19,119
happening and so there really is a

695
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,798
global uh issues there are global issues

696
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,759
that really need to be addressed and

697
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,440
this is just a symptom of those yeah

698
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,519
well

699
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,960
interesting i hope this all works itself

700
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:30,639
out and

701
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,480
i know that

702
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,399
any uh

703
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,558
recreational user as well as a medical

704
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,239
you know cannabis user

705
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,398
is experiencing

706
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,720
prices that

707
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:47,199
are unsustainable for them as consumers

708
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,759
even you know absolutely yeah people

709
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,200
have less and less resources yeah and if

710
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,599
we want to see the you know small

711
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,759
businesses survive in california

712
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,918
especially let's remember small cannabis

713
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,558
businesses do not have access to federal

714
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,960
relief funds right so any funding that's

715
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:07,839
come in as part of pandemic relief has

716
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,240
not gone to cannabis farmers let's also

717
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,359
remember they can't write cannabis taxes

718
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,759
off yeah 280e at the federal level

719
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,599
cannabis operators can't write off basic

720
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,679
business expenses that every other

721
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,199
business is able to so they're really

722
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,038
getting siphon they're really getting

723
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,519
siphoned from all sides

724
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,599
and what we need is is relief and

725
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,839
support you know for these small

726
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,558
businesses otherwise we're going to see

727
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:35,199
mass changes to the socioeconomic

728
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,960
fabrics of these small rural areas

729
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,360
and that you know that's going to be

730
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,000
really hard to address even harder than

731
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,719
it is today yeah well it's a big part of

732
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,640
