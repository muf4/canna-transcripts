episode 64 relationships developed in

48
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,120
good to be involved with band members of

49
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,039
the opposite sex because if the

relationship falls apart someone will

51
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,000
have to leave the B and and in our cases

00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,560
it wasn't the guys that left which meant

the first to have a relationship with

one of the girls after a soy Cowboy

asked candy out to lunch and somehow

that took off she had an apartment on

writing more songs however my

73
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,200
relationship with Candi began to hinder

the smooth functioning of the band as

75
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,919
Candi developed a sense of Diva ship at

76
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:36,039
performances she had a commanding stage

77
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,878
presence setting her apart from the

78
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:41,199
other girls she had experience as a

79
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:44,120
singer and some notoriety in the local

80
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:47,199
Thai community at times she would carry

81
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,680
on a bit of banter on stage with Joe who

82
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,759
by this time had fully embraced his role

83
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,640
as the band's front man and who by now

84
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,239
was usually wearing a cowboy hat and

85
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,759

huh and as evidenced by that first show

90
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,200
on KCRW Joe had developed a stick around

91
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,478
his brand of Tai Western Exotica and was

92
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,599
at times quite

93
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,439
humorous but underneath the humorous

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,080
banter between Joe and candy there was

have some pad tie at a restaurant while

the whole band was waiting for for us we

get food and hang out a bit with friends

00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,199
autonomy she didn't want me going

121
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,399

leaving me with no pay until it was paid

favorite not just because my application

274
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,198
involved Karma as a reason for my

275
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,000
conscientious objection but because it

276

broke Karma down into various categories

of weed at the beginning of a weekend

283
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,000
because drug testing was random in the

Navy and there was always a possibility

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,399
of getting busted on a p test that would

be

they were grounding

managed to pull it off for about a month

and then one day while I was working

303
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,679
down at SAR Hilo hanger there was an

304

inspection of the rooms by a master

on his face when he opened the door and

307
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,320
found Candi

after work Candi told me what had

310
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:41,198
happened and there was a note to go see

311

the master chief who as it turned out

312
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,319
was a kindly Filipino guy and he

313
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,360
politely told me that I had to move

314
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,839
candy out of the barracks he didn't

315
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,560
write me up or sign any

316
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,639

317
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,638
found out candy was

318
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,519
pregnant I told my mom about the turn of

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,399
was a small pickup truck with a camper

kind of cozy a little cramped but candy

Credit Union parking lot

330
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,720

331
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,159
there there were RV stations down toward

00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:07,000

sincerity and origins of my Buddhist

343

345
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,320
noticed many of the previous applicants

346
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,439

with the Thai temple in North Hollywood

350
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,239
and knew a few of the monks personally

354
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,838

359
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:51,159

362
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,879
language class for foreigners and I won

363
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,000
a trophy for being the top student

364
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,919

385
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,519
application together I asked Som an

386
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:11,199

389
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,759
talked to the Abbott and he asked me to

390
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,160
give them a framework for a letter and

391
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,480
they would add to it and the Abbott

392
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,798
would sign

393
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,599
it and as I sat across from the chaplain

394
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:30,400
I noticed he had the letter from the

395

born into a Catholic Family I always

399
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,000
believed in

all of one's actions good or bad and

402
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:49,918
then having married a Buddhist after I

joined the military my beliefs in

with my beliefs because I was helping

intact

511
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,200
I never regretted my time in the Navy

512
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,679
especially working at SAR Hilo point meu

513
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,360
with such outstanding people let me

514
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,120
first shout out to Senior Chief Don

515
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,839
oeline a great supervisor and a very

516
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,678
cool human being as I mentioned in

517
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,839
episode 64 he helped me with some

518
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,038
difficult troubleshooting on the

519
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,359
intercom of one of the H

520
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:31,480
46s he was an avionic Tech as well with

521
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,119
many years of experience on the

522
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,919
helicopter he approved every reasonable

523
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:40,519
request I had such as appearing live on

524
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:42,640
KCRW in the middle of a work day a great

525
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,119
guy who had a sense of humor that was at

526
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,400
times insightful and at other times full

527
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,959
of

528
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,159
irony I remember reading him one of my

529
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,159
essays written during my undergraduate

530
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:54,159
studies in business

531
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,000
management

532
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:05,038
there was a pilot Lieutenant Commander

533
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,759
as he was a Vietnam era helicopter pilot

534
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,839
who could be seen wandering through the

535
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:12,079
offices in our Hangar collecting

536
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:14,439
aluminum cans out of trash bins for

537
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,918
recycling he was the ranking officer at

538
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,278
SAR Hilo and yet somehow you knew he was

539
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,080
never going to make

540
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:25,960
commander and yet so did he I

541
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:28,480
believe Mr as drove a 196 Ford Falcon

542
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,120
Ranchero and it was one of our

543
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,159
Pilots Mike chinsky one of the rescue

544
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,918
swimmers and a friend of mine with whom

545
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,200
I am still in touch related the story

546
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,399
about a flight he was on with the

547
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,200
lieutenant commander piloting one Sunday

548
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:45,158
they were about 100 miles out from point

549
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,720
muu when a filter chip indicator popped

550
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:51,039
yellow with a hint of red on one of the

551
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,519
Transmissions if a transmission fails on

552
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,278
a helicopter the rotor sees up and the

553
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,879
helicopter drops like a

554
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,240
stone as wanted to put the helicopter

555
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,640
down in the water but Mike was sure he

556
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,319
didn't want the embarrassment of having

557
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,320
to be rescued by the Coast Guard and so

558
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:11,319
he talked Mr as into flying low and slow

559
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:14,038
back to point muu and somehow they made

560
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:17,678
it and there was the hot shot an apis

561
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:21,480
grad Lieutenant JP McAn he was a partyer

562
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,320
a good pilot and your All-American type

563
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,679
I remember being weightless once in the

564
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:29,599
back of the helicopter with Manan at the

565
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,000
stick

566
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:34,599
I had friends as well who worked with me

567
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,880
most of whom were risky swimmers I was

568
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,599
more of a runner and I got a whole group

569
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,000
of them running up to the radar towers

570
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,519
with me we would take two cars to the

571
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,558
top and leave one there and drive back

572
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:49,200
down in my VW van and park next to a

573
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,398
farmhouse and run up the road to the

574
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,798
towers the radar towers are on the

575
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:55,719
Northern tip of the Santa Monica

576
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:59,679
Mountains overlooking the base below and

577
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,679
the Pacific Ocean to the South and West

578
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,840
Bill Darlington and Joe hollandsworth

579
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:11,640
were two of the rescue swimmers who

580
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,359
became my good friends Joe used to come

581
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,880
into town with me in the early days of

582
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,678
scouting for singers and we stayed at my

583
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,000
mom's house after night spent eating

584
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,440
Thai food and drinking

585
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,119
beer bill was the guy who originally

586
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,278
started jogging with me to the radar

587
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,199
towers and who convinced the rest of the

588
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:31,240
guys to come along

589
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,038
we are still in touch to this

590
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,798
day I must also thank the civilian women

591
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:38,119
who worked in the admin offices of the

592
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:39,398
hangar and who took care of paperwork

593
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,439
for the

594
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:43,359
division there was one who taught me how

595
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,399
to use a word processor so I could get

596
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,240
my assignments done while I was working

597
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:50,199
on my undergraduate classes at the

598
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,679
University of lever's on base

599
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,240
extension I also use their computers to

600
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:58,679
write my coo

601
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,720
application I can't remember their names

602
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,960
by the day of my discharge Kenny Miller

603
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,200
my friend who had now become a lawyer

604
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,600
and who was the band's first manager

605
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,159

609
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,080
and briefly got back together for the

day you might have seen one recently

618
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,960
about a trojan horse being rejected and

619
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,599
falling off a cliff after being unmasked

620
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,278
by the it

623
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,518
called the

624
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,200
cell an Englishman named caruzo Fuller

625
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:07,719
signed us to what turned out to be a bad

626
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,360
record deal little did we know his

627
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,440
record company based in England had no

628
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:14,639
distribution and his main goal was to

629
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,798
sell us to a big label something that

630
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,038
never

631
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:20,679
happened but we were happy to get

632
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:22,960
advances and somehow Overlook the Clause

633
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,600
giving carizo the rights to the songs

634
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,880
for 20

635
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,199
years we since have recovered those

636
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,760

639
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:43,519

640
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,080
Joe and got herself kicked out of the

641
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,558
band I felt curiously relieved and knew

642
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:50,558
our marriage was going to be the next

after candy left the band A friend of

648
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:06,159
Pras named Sarah joined the band at that

649
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,079
time she worked as a waitress atlai

restaurant on Van eyes near Ventura

651

Boulevard Sarah was the tallest of our

652
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:17,000
background singers and somehow I ended

653
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,080
up in a relationship with the tallest

654
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,450
guy in the band Joe which lasted about a

655
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,639
year or two and didn't end well

00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:33,119
which blossomed on a NorCal tour and

659
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,840
didn't last long especially after Tim

660
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:39,158
met Leela's husband who we knew nothing

661
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:42,519
about and who luckily knew nothing about

662
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:44,360
Tim as it turned out in the end I wasn't

663
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,480
the only guy in the band that violated

664
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:49,759
the sane policy of no relationships with
