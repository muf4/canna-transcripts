1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,559
summer solstice

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,080
happy summer solstice here's a

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,679
bedlin

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
there's uh some of the later here's one

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,160
of the earliest males to fly

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,000
and uh

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,000
the females are just starting to show

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,600
i left about seven or eight full size

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,320
about a third of the crop i just went

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,760
ahead and folded over

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,320
and then several others i chopped the

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,439
top off of

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,439
these are all uh strategies um to

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,879
experiment with dealing with the extreme

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,439
drought situation these have not

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,679
received any water here in utah

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,679
these uh not been

18
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,479
fed or watered they were direct seeded

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,719
on march 19th again here's a male coming

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,718
around

21
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,398
and i'm doing this as a demonstration

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,039
project to show people that dry farming

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,439
actually can occur wherever you are

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,000
we are in extraordinary drought

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,399
and again these have not been fed i'm

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,799
having some serious pest issues but

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,880
i'm going to have a really good medicine

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,360
crop for my daughter's mother who's

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,359
dealing with cancer

30
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,158
all natural with true terroir

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,040
you can see uh this is alkali dust from

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,719
a small rainstorm we just had

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,118
um

34
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,519
i know leighton likes to say that

35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,920
um we don't get bacterial

36
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,478
or microbe distribution

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,200
anymore but um it's quite obvious that

38
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,438
we do get quite a bit of windstorm

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,478
activity that blows

40
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,158
surface soil particles

41
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,920
and

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,960
deposits them

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,439
you can see it in the snow on the

44
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,399
mountains it turns all dark because of

45
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:53,839
all these soil particles in the air but

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,960
anyhow um bugs i'm dealing with are the

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,399
pill bug

48
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,039
earwigs

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,519
grasshopper

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,399
and uh

51
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,640
spinosad is my number one go-to and veg

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,280
for these things but i also am doing

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,199
pyrethrin flower um tea

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,000
yeah that's a quick update for you all

55
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,079
on on the bed liam philbian

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,360
again the males are all i removed the

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
majority of them the last ones are

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,400
turning and the females are just showing

59
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,878
up

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,800
and it's solstice

61
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,840
appreciate y'all for

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,480
learning how to change the world with me

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,039
yeah i know these don't look awesome

64
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,518
these are uh this is worst case middle

65
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,280
of the [ __ ] desert we don't get rain

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,599
we don't we get extreme temperatures we

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239
get these actually just had

68
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,560
five days of

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,800
30 mile an hour wind basically

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,560
i ripped out branches from my my front

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,040
yard trees and uh so these were furnace

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,878
blasted we were 97 degrees the first day

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,560
of it

74
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,719
so

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,560
take that all for what it is never been

76
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,959
fed never been watered

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,158
extreme desert blasting conditions

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,519
right

79
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,919
so i'm not claiming that these are

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,200
beautiful i'm not claiming this is

81
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,199
the end all here there's a

82
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,000
pest right there

83
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,439
i'm just showing you can do this just

84
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,439
put seeds in the ground and produce a

85
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,959
crop you don't need to be spending

86
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,959
a million dollars on a facility

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,840
pounds for pennies
