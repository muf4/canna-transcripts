2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,199
so

3
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,200
what's up friends who wants to make some

4
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,519
brownies i know i do

5
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,840
come on let's get started first things

6
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,719
first i just keep it real this is

7
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
exactly what i get a box of brownie mix

8
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,798
i love ghirardelli

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
gheradelli's the [ __ ] they got all sorts

10
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,040
of different flavors this one has got to

11
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,400
be one of my favorites i like to keep it

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,479
easy all this recipe asks for is an egg

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,719
a quarter cup of water and a third cup

14
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,560
of vegetable oil but you know what kind

15
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,359
of oil we're going to be adding

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,118
cannabis oil so first thing we gotta do

17
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,040
is preheat our oven that way it gets

18
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,438
nice and toasty warm

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,040
325

20
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:51,279
there we go don't forget to press start

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,118
so i got a couple ingredients we mix it

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,519
all together but i just highly recommend

23
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,399
that you add the egg first

24
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,478
that way in case if you get uh any

25
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,599
um cracks from the shell you could go

26
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,599
ahead and pick them out

27
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,719
i saved my eggs i always like to rinse

28
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,959
them off and let them dry out and save

29
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,039
them it makes for great calcium

30
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,239
so whip up that egg really nice with the

31
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,439
whisk

32
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,159
then add a little water

33
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,400
i add some cannabis oil remember we made

34
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,598
this in the last video i shared with you

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,599
guys how to make cannabis oil and um

36
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,560
cannabis butter

37
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:35,199
this recipe calls for vegetable oil so i

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
used that coconut oil that i made it's

39
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,399
just

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,159
the regular um virgin coconut oil

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,920
mix that up nice and well see how it's

42
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,159
green

43
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,159
yeah

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,840
there we go

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
then we pull out our bag

46
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,159
i know there's a lot of really great and

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,400

and if you're up for a nice challenge

50
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,318
then

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,318
take it to the next level you know this

52
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,479
one has caramel in it which is super

53
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,079
yummy you could add pecans to this if

54
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,079
you wanted to i totally would if i had

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
pecans on me right now

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
um

57
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,439
another one that i really like is just

58
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,280
chocolate with a bit of a peppermint

59
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,519
extract so it tastes like peppermint

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,680
chocolate ooh that's so good if you got

61
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,680
any brownie recipes or anything that you

62
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
love adding to your brownies go ahead

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,920
and let us know in the comments i'd love

64
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,799
to hear it because i love baking

65
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,479
especially baking with canvas

66
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,000
all right there we go

67
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,039
nice and stirred up

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,039
see how thick that is

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
i'm just gonna get the chocolate off of

70
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,280
here

71
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,480
i like making my brownies in a square

72
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,120
pan

73
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,878
parchment paper is your best friend

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,120
this helps so that the brownies don't

75
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,079
stick to the bottom of the pan

76
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
it makes

77
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
baking easy and it makes cleanup way

78
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,878
easier too

79
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,798
so i'm trying to press my parchment

80
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:08,000
paper on the bottom of this pan here

81
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,040
and fold in the corners

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,039
my favorite spatula

83
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,120
and then we just dunk the brownie mix

84
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,120
right in the middle

85
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,079
try not to get it on the parchment paper

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,079
of course

87
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,319
and scrape it off the bowl

88
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,239
next step is to make sure that the

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,160
brownie is going into all of the corners

90
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,879
of this pan so i'm using the spatula

91
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,199
just to kind of pull this

92
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,199
brownie mixture to the corners like this

93
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,439
there we go

94
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,639
so this one comes with the caramel pouch

95
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,719
and basically what you do is you kind of

96
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,439
warm it up like this

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,440
for about a minute

98
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,159
then you get your scissors

99
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,519
and you cut out the tiniest corner

100
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,199
because you're going to be squeezing it

101
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,120
out you don't want a thick

102
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
cut off of the corner because then you

103
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,478
end up getting too much caramel in one

104
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,000
area you want to be nice and

105
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,680
even with like a smooth drizzle

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,839
that's perfect

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,840
see that

108
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,639
now what i'm going to be doing on my

109
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,639
brownie pan is

110
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,639
putting zigzags going up and down

111
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,519
cool so got a little bit left for the

112
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,520
top

113
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,759
there we go

114
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,399
the potency of your brownies is gonna

115
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,478
depend

116
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,560
on what what a

117
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,639
cannabis product that you added into the

118
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,399
oils when you made your oils because

119
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,319
this asks for a third cup of oil

120
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,038
regardless so

121
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,960
that's all it uh

122
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,719
and also if you wanted like a lighter

123
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,038
potency you could just cut the brownies

124
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,600
up into smaller parts

125
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,199
see how we have this right now

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
so what i do

127
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,000
let me see if i can get the camera that

128
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,560
would be a lot easier for me

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,560
there we go

130
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,680
so i take the knife and i go across this

131
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
way

132
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,000
see how it made that design

133
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,639
then i do the same thing going the

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,639
opposite way

135
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:59,638
i'm not trying to drag it too deep just

136
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,639
dragging my knife across the top

137
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,038
you like that

138
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,240
cool

139
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,919
as soon as the timer is ready it's all

140
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,918
ready to go in the oven that didn't take

141
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:15,598
me no time to make these at all

142
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:19,359
all right oven just went off 325 degrees

143
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:22,079
so this perfect pan is ready to go in

144
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,080
oh it's hot

145
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,960
perfect

146
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,280
all right it says 38 to 42 minutes i

147
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,120
usually like to go exactly in the middle

148
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,959
of what it's suggesting

149
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
so i'm going to go with 40 minutes on

150
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,038
this box

151
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,038
timer for 40 minutes

152
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:41,598
cool

153
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,199
we'll get back to it as soon as he's

154
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,519
come out of the oven

155
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,319
all right the timer just went off

156
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,758
so the thing about brownies

157
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,319
i'm gonna go ahead and turn the oven

158
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,319
completely off so no more heat is being

159
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,319
produced i'm just gonna let the heat

160
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,879
stay in there because the thing about

161
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,360
brownies is they take a long time to

162
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,599
slowly cool down most baked goods aren't

163
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,240
like that like cookies or cakes as soon

164
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,159
as the timer goes off you do the little

165
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,160
poke test with the fork or whatever to

166
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,960
make sure that the batter is cooked all

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,039
the way

168
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,959
and then you're done uh with brownies

169
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,399
and cheesecakes you just gotta leave it

170
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:20,318
in the oven for about a minute so i'm

171
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,318
gonna sit here

172
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,919
actually it's been a minute since i've

173
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
turned the oven off

174
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,799
so now what i'm gonna do is just give

175
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,478
this door a small little crack

176
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,038
like that

177
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,679
so that way it gives the oven a chance

178
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,639
to completely cool off

179
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:42,000
and the brownies take a long time

180
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,158
to um they're still baking while they're

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,559
cooling off you don't want to rush the

182
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,439
cool off process just let it take its

183
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,439
time

184
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
so i'll probably come back here in about

185
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,120
um

186
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,800
five to ten minutes

187
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,959
and pull them out and then they're going

188
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,120
to be cooling out on the counter for

189
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,119
probably about another 10 minutes until

190
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,399
they're completely ready to be cut up

191
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,480
okay

192
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,360
uh it's been about five minutes so now

193
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,360
it's time to take them out

194
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,160
oh yeah these are looking really nice

195
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,159
see

196
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,879
pretty cool huh

197
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
so i'm just gonna let these cool off for

198
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,120
a minute

199
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
uh

200
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,000
maybe about five minutes total

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,720
let me show you uh

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,919
the fork test i was talking about

203
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,920
you take a fork and you dip it

204
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,679
if it comes out clean you know it's

205
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,200
baked

206
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,479
so

207
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,480
this is going to cool off on here

208
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,560
for about 10 more minutes then it's easy

209
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,278
to just take it out and to cut it up

210
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,199
into slices and depending on how much

211
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,278
you take is how much of a dose you're

212
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,278
gonna get so don't forget about that i

213
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,200
highly recommend starting with just a

214
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,439
much smaller bite at first and waiting

215
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,278
half an hour and see how it affects you

216
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,160
for some people it could take up to one

217
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,600
hour um basically uh that's about it

218
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,759
brownies are easy that's why i love

219
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,519
making them for more information about

220
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,879

221
