1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,960
this is usually my seasonal storage

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:08,599
Greenhouse just got a bunch of pots and

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,460
irrigation lights

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:14,879
[ __ ] but uh

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,260
yeah this year I'm gonna be uh just

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,719
running

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,000
but I got 44 pots in here

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,059
probably just do a little Fino Hunts uh

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,679
some uh some stuff not really sure quite

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,538
yet but I do have you know like the

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,420
party lights

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,740
that uh that I can control the photo

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,579
period

14
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,399
um

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,179
got some soil in there I was playing

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,299
around with the recipe so

17
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,700
uh yeah

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:47,578
got uh another little grow room back

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,379
here this is just kind of my outdoor

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,219
breeding area

21
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,479
which is going crazy with the cover crop

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,739
um

23
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,359
I haven't really got this thing up and

24
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:01,519
running

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,519
to throw some tobacco seed in there

26
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,599
it's going a little crazy I just pull a

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,658
couple of those out and thin them out

28
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,658
um

29
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,859
but this is uh

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,920
got the pollen donor pots set up and

31
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,200
then the main beds

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,939
but yeah this greenhouse is kind of

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,219
seasonal don't really use use it a whole

34
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,618
lot unless I've got a lot going on but

35
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,060
since I've been busy filling pots and

36
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,438
whatnot

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,200
um it's kind of just been sitting

38
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:35,339
waiting for me to plant it

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:39,600
some of my Oz selections back here

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,040

it's uh you know starting off slow but

52
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,618
uh I feel like uh

53
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,719
this is what I had envisioned for the

54
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,580

55
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,459

um

59
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,340
typically running you know four rows per

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,819
pot

61
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,819

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,640
filter we got eye mineral content in our

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,659
in our well water and then just a little

64
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:42,598
