7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,198
in southern oregon in the applegate

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,559
valley at phoenix rising farm

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,080
with a very dear friend casey branham

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,079
thanks for joining us casey thanks for

11
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,598
having me brother we're also here with

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,439
folks from the cannabis conservancy we

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,879
got jeremy lord here

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,200
good day we're going to walk through the

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,759
greenhouses kind of get the low down

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,320
on this truly sustainable regenerative

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,000
farm

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,759
right along the river in the applegate

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,960
valley

20
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,199
we're going to try and bring you the

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
listener here with us with the birds

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,120
chirping the river

23
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,878
rumbling behind us and the most amazing

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,159
scents and sounds of cannabis

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,320
and beneficial insects and the soil food

26
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,359
web beneath the canopy so

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,679
bear with us on a new journey but

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,600
welcome come along

29
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,719
one of the coolest things about this

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,079
farm casey

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,680
is these animals and tell us a little

32
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,478
bit about what's going on with some of

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,680
the animals

34
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:15,599
okay so here on the farm we have uh

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,080
eight alpacas one llama and three goats

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,359
and you know animal husbandry isn't

37
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,759
necessarily my bag

38
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,118
i i really appreciate these guys though

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,118
they're so fun

40
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:29,040
and they bring a tremendous

41
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,239
component to the farm which is their

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,759
poop

43
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,959
we they their manure gives us

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,840
mulch uh tea components for our compost

45
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,239
tea

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:47,040
and a great layer uh in our fall

47
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:51,679
sheet mulch so this is one of our three

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,680
non-assisted light depth greenhouses

49
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,200
in here uh plants are grown just right

50
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:00,159
here in the native soil this is a

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,640
a sandy loam from an alluvial deposit

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,200
from the little applegate river

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
um one of the things about our farm that

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,598
we find important

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,280
is to grow a polyculture garden which

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,399
means just a lot of diversity plant

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,159
diversity

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,039
mixed in grown in companionship with the

59
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,239
cannabis so we've got potatoes

60
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,359
sunflowers comfrey pretty much

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,319
everywhere all over the farm you'll see

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
a lot of comfrey

63
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:28,079
this particular plant is so amazing so

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,039
many different uses

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,719
typically we'll cut the leaves and put

66
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,519
them in a barrel and ferment them we'll

67
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,759
add sugar

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,120
and make a fermented plant juice which

69
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,000
we then feed

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
the soil other than that you know this

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,519
stuff just keeps growing as we water it

72
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,119
so we'll chop the leaves drop them

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,640
and they'll just kind of disintegrate

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,959
and dissolve and do their thing

75
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:53,759
nourishing the soil um

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
we got some ice cream cake right here

77
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,079
just about ready

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,400
um but looking great so beautiful those

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
purples on the tips of the calyxes just

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,319
really

81
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,039
have so much personality yeah it's one

82
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,359
of my favorite

83
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,280
characteristics of the ice cream cake

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,000
definitely

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,598
another real important part of this

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
grow here in these these native soil

87
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:21,359
beds is having a really

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,959
developed soil ecosystem so

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
typically in a lot of these you'll find

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,479
mushrooms we've got king straforia

91
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,000
growing up under the canopy

92
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,679
and along the drip lines you can find

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
some mushrooms

94
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,159
every fall we'll lay a mulch down of

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,120
deciduous leaves collected from the

96
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,639
property

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,560
and from the the greater rogue valley

98
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,039
we'll go and we'll grab a

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,840
u-haul truck and go around and pick up

100
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,798
people's bags of leaves

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,878
in doing so we get a really great

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,719
variety of deciduous leaves

103
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,239
so stuff that you wouldn't see out here

104
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,840
you know sugar maples all sorts of

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,480
different ornamentals that grow

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,158
in people's yards in town we can get all

107
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,679
those leaves bring them here

108
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,598
let them do their thing and nourish the

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,400
soil so we'll lay down leaves we'll lay

110
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,759
down

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,200
alfalfa hay which is a high nitrogen

112
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,399
dominant hay which is grown all over the

113
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,039
valley here

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
and then we'll do uh manure from our

115
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,439
alpacas

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,040
uh goats and llama and we'll do

117
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,800
we've also got a dairy farm just right

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
down here like i was mentioning before

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
and we'll get some of their dairy manure

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,079
as well and then we'll kind of cover

121
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,000
that with a layer of rice straw

122
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,000
and just let it do its thing every year

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,560
we keep adding to it and every year we

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
get

125
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,319
better and better results from the soil

126
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,680
oh yeah wood chips

127
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,360
we'll either doing fire remediation

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,120
around the property

129
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,759
being in this southern oregon area it's

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,319
hot it's dry fire is a big problem

131
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,759
so we'll cut trees to keep to give

132
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,240
ourselves some space

133
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,960
and we'll chip those trees up and lay

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,560
down the

135
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,399
the oak madrone alder ash

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
whatever else is growing out here

137
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,799
typically hardwoods

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
will lay them down too and just just

139
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,879
keep building

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
and it's really makes it makes you know

141
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,879
produce this kind of stuff

142
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,519
it's so amazing the combination of the

143
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,959
like

144
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,000
ultra hyper local off of the property

145
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,560
inputs

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,319
and then the you know just a little

147
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,399
footprint further out and out for some

148
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,879
of the other inputs that you don't have

149
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,519
but to bring all this diversity to your

150
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,000
soil food web so you're able to have

151
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,758
a wider variety of breakdown times a

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,879
wider variety of species so you're

153
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,639
encouraging different

154
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,719
fungal and microbacterial microorganisms

155
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,960
to really develop because there's more

156
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,479
food sources so more organisms find

157
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,680
their own niche i think exactly

158
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,279
absolutely amazing jeremy

159
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,759
this is kind of your bread and butter

160
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,038
you're here for an inspection right

161
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,759
absolutely i mean that's what we're

162
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:53,038
doing here

163
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,720
and the reason i was so reluctant to

164
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,478
jump on your radio show is because it's

165
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,319
about the farmer it's not just about

166
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,159
third-party certification but that's

167
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
absolutely what certification is about

168
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,600
it's about rewarding this work you know

169
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,759
it's about acknowledging it

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,360
and helping to push it further in the

171
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,759
conversation

172

this time and

178
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,719

winning crasher crasher's right here yep

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,600
just gorgeous i love the upright

187
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,439
structure i mean

188
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,879
it's trellised out nicely to spread it

189
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,959
but it doesn't look like it's really

190
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,719
relying on it at all it's not a flopper

191
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,439
it's standing tall and it's just it's

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,160
chunked

193
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,079
and just gorgeous man yeah you can that

194
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,039
structure is just amazing

195
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,839
tight solid flower really really

196
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,399
beautiful not

197
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,478
super leafy no that's a quick easy trim

198
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,038
job exactly oh but the extract out of

199
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,159
there is

200
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:06,399
mouth-watering yeah

201
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,560
you know i love listening to you break

202
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,758
down your methods as far as the the

203
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,519
layering and

204
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,520
you know sourcing everything from from

205
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,279
your local environment and your

206
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,719
neighbors

207
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,719
you were the first person i remember

208
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
really uh

209
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
you know turning me on to incorporating

210
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,559
you know clover

211
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,519
planting clover yeah yeah number 10 10

212
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,478
years ago i came up

213
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,240
yeah and learned that part of you know

214
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,758
not only just um

215
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
stabilizing the temperature of the soil

216
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,240
but also just you know bringing that

217
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,560
food back into that

218
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,160
absolutely i mean living mulch and cover

219
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,120
cropping i mean that that's such a huge

220
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,479
part of it

221
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,240
of of adding nutrients to the soil and

222
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,560
prolonging the soil's life i mean

223
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,680
up here it's so hot and dry you know the

224
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,319
sun just beats down

225
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,079
having some protective covering is

226
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,720
fantastic and then you can just chop it

227
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,800
drop it

228
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
push it right into the next round and

229
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,079
they love it

230
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,679
yeah it acts as a green manure as much

231
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,560
as it kind of creates a home

232
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,918
for all the beneficial bugs that are

233
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,360
here and you're getting that nitrogen

234
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,598
fixation as well with

235
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,479
plants like clover and and peas and all

236
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,279
the other

237
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,199
uh legume type stuff right on top of the

238
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,598
aeration aspect of like

239
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,080
you know the daikon and some of those

240
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,680
whatever bulldozer of cover crops where

241
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,120
they're actually breaking up some of the

242
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,598
bigger chunks and creating good

243
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,879
air space so when you layer it in you

244
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,439
know it breaks down

245
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,120
refills and just what we like about the

246
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,879
comfrey 2 and some of the other plants

247
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,158
that we mix in here is their biodynamic

248
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,320
accumulators which means

249
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,479
their roots go really deep and they pull

250
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,959
up nutrients from deep down in the soil

251
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,759
and then as you chop and drop their

252
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,199
foliage

253
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,278
you're getting those nutrients back up

254
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,720
on the top of the soil so you're getting

255
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,000
all that stuff it's just pulling from

256
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,040
the bottom and bringing it up to the

257
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,120
surface and then you can

258
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,439
then these plants can access it closer

259
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,278
where they wouldn't be so deep rooted

260
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,839
you know makes sense wow this is the

261
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:55,838
chem cookies

262
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,600
oh man i love that you get the chemical

263
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,600
gas but you got that cookie structure

264
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,040
so beautiful yeah that's a nice one and

265
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,519
that looks like it's got a few weeks

266
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,319
left yeah we got some time on this one

267
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,959
so beautiful that white against those

268
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,040
light orange hairs

269
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:23,729
always working well there we go farmers

270
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:28,240
are the ultimate multitaskers

271
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,320
[Music]

272
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
you
