all right before the big reveal i also

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,640
want to say that i've been getting a lot

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,079
of questions about this spider farmer s

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,239
e 5000 light people are eager to know

29
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,200
how's it going for me what's it growing

30
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,679
like

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,000
i don't know yet but the good news is

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
this grow will be fully documented

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,879
you'll be able to see what the spider

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,759
farmer sc5000 light is doing for me

35
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,759
let's reveal my decision

36
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,559
all right so the hippies won but i've

37
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,879
got a long hair and a beard so you

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,799
really should have seen that one coming

39
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,199
and i actually did kind of change the

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,880
plans and some of this was based on the

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,840
comments that i got in the previous

42
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,478
video so again thank you uh as you can

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,280
see i've got two different soil blends

44
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,920
so i'm not going with the bed instead

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,560
i've got some seven gallon pots that i'm

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,318
going to rock these two soils in

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,800
now this

48
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:20,238
sohum living soil is a water only mix

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,200
so is this kiss organics makes

50
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,400
some people have poo pooed the thought

51
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,519
of

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,959
water only bagged soil

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,719
that's why we're going to put it to the

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,120
test and one thing to consider too is

55
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:38,239
i'm not going to be growing production

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,560
sized plants i am growing what the

57
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,719
average home grower is going to be

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,439
growing so we'll keep that in mind along

59
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,800
the way and see exactly how far these

60
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,159
are going to get us

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,640
