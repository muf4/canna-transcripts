1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,660
oh hey how's it going uh doing another

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,259
field note on this one Kandahar another

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,039
Afghan land race variety I'm by myself

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:16,138
so I'm doing a selfie style here so

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,538
sorry it's not quite as flexible with

6
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:22,439
the video uh but we've got three

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:25,260
Kandahar uh plants that want to show you

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,379
um and they're very very very different

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,740
uh phenotypes all three are distinctly

10
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:34,500
different so that's the thing when uh

11
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,179
and these plants come from a region it's

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,519
not necessarily that they're all going

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,100
to be completely uniform and we're

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,800
definitely seeing with the Kandahar

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,120
three completely unique uh phenotypes so

16
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,419
I'll show you those I'm going to flip

17
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,419
this around

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,439
so this

19
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,619
is kind of I've seen a number of Afghans

20
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,359
that have this just bushy globe and by

21
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,179
the way we didn't top this plant at all

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,058
it's just kind of a cousin it just big

23
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,079
brown blob of leaves but there are

24
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:06,118
actually

25
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,819
really nice

26
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,099
uh chunky

27
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,559
colas in there and these are pretty

28
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,500
close I might even consider taking some

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,219
of these today but uh probably the top

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,340
Cola I will uh but then over here we've

31
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,560
got our third our second Kandahar so you

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,540
can see completely different structure

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,060
totally different structure

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:35,600
so um

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:39,960
yeah so obviously this is not a uniform

36
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:42,539
from the region of Kandahar uh there's a

37
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,459
lot of variants anyway and this one's

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,460
beautiful oh I should do a smell check

39
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,239
um

40
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:57,438
okay uh very strong uh perfumey sort of

41
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,438
that same bug spray

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,859
mothball situation going on uh so really

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,780
really intense

44
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,280
uh

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,520
yeah I can't think of a better thing

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,459
than mothballs and bug spray

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,920
um maybe a little Cedar that's been a

48
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:21,080
theme and then

49
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:23,878
we have another Kandahar and this one

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,900
totally different structure it's very

51
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:29,280
hot tall really shot up so it's tall and

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,939
bushy

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,878
um

54
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,979
and this one is actually not this

55
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,840
probably has at least two weeks to go

56
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,939
until these buds

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,979
finish out

58
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,199
um so I'll just go back to this other

59
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,060
one because we by the way we're

60
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,119
definitely gonna Harvest

61
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,860
some of these tops and a lot of times by

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,500
the way we don't pull the yellow leaves

63
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,780
off and everything so sorry if that's

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,120
offensive to anyone we just kind of let

65
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,219
the plant do its thing and as they

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,879
finish flower they start dropping leaves

67
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:05,098
sort of like a just leaves in of a tree

68
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,719
and Autumn

69
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,479
so anyway

70
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,359
but that's what these buds look like

71
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,060
anyway

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,459
yet again another very cool Afghan

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,500
variety Kandahar and I'm gonna start

74
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,500
harvesting right now bye
