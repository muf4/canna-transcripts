2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,599
beautiful out here today that i'd take

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,719
you around and show you

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:14,558
take you on a garden tour i guess

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:16,800
let's start with a strawberry

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,879
this strawberry we used to have uh

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,880
several rows

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,559
of this stuff and when we got these

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:27,278
ducks that i'm about to turn loose

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,640
they uh destroyed most of it and i just

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,799
had like a few

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,799
pieces of it that i saved

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,599
nursed it back to health last year and

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,039
that's

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,960
that's all we got but at least we're

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,799
getting strawberries this year so

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,000
happy about that and it should be plenty

18
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,359
of them and

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,119
yeah looks looks nice okay show you the

20
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,399
garden

21
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:55,839
this is oh turn these chickens loose too

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
so he's not squawking as much

23
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,839
he does

24
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,719
that rooster's lucky to be alive right

25
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,079
now and i'll show you

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,879
why at the end of this video

27
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,879
he's pretty though

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
all right this is the garden that's

29
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,560
horseradish

30
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,560
that is wonderful stuff i love that

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,840
stuff i like strong flavors

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,079
yes stuff's great on a sandwich or

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,118
if you like cocktail sauce makes it's

34
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,199
the secret ingredient in cocktail sauce

35
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,799
very very very good stuff it's

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,519
supposedly good for you too it makes me

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,479
feel

38
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,959
different anyway this is the garden i

39
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:46,959
dumped a

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,079
an entire that

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,799
i don't know if you can see that well

42
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,000
from way over here but that worm bin

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,320
right over there i'll show it to you

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,640
here in a second i dump that entire

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:05,279
thing in here

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,280
and this mulch

47
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:12,639
right here really it

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,759
retains moisture it keeps the it works

49
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,598
really well i do

50
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,719
very little watering after the plants

51
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:21,439
get past this stage right here

52
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,039
like those are actually big enough i can

53
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,680
move that mulch in on them now that

54
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,239
those

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,239
yeah those

56
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,000
when they're tiny i i water them a

57
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,680
little bit at night and make sure that

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,159
they stay alive but

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
anyway that's but after that this this

60
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,919
all these grass clippings really

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
take care of it i don't have to do any

62
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,878
watering just

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
let the rain do it this is a snap peas

64
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,120
they've been through

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,120
duck problems like i've they

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,519
they keep sniffing them out so i planted

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,599
another row out further

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,439
but they didn't they didn't germinate as

69
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,439
well as these original ones that

70
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,800
did because they ate most of them you

71
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,800
see little duck hulls right here

72
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,039
anyway so you got carrots gonna thin

73
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,559
those

74
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,400
out once they get just a little bit

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,439
bigger spinach

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,959
lettuce mustard greens

77
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,158
right here and turnips

78
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,759
turnip greens because i don't really

79
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,199
like the turnips so much but i do like

80
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,518
the greens

81
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,399
so i've got a bunch of stuff to plant in

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:32,799
here later on today

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:36,080
so this is the cool weather crops

84
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,200
yeah i dumped this the entire worm bin

85
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,680
into into there

86
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,679
and i just

87
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,958
it covered it like several inches thick

88
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:55,120
and then i rebuilt it so

89
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,360
yeah much nicer than the the first one

90
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,878
i'm never touching it again just pulling

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,120
stuff out of the front of it and that's

92
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,959

125
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,959
yeah it's a nice little spot back here

126
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
try not to mow it until we have to

127
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,000
because it's so beautiful back here in

128
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,918
the springtime it's their little meadow

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:53,839
ducks love it i'm bothering them right

130
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:53,839
now so i'll leave them alone

131
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,560
i had a tomato incident

132
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,918
those uh basil and the peppers that just

133
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
showed you went through it too

134
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,079
they all all went through hell i said

135
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,680
there was a north wind that came through

136
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,918
in the middle of the day that i

137
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,199
didn't know about started off at like in

138
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,719
the mid 50s and

139
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,319
that's supposed to end in the mid 50s

140
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
but in the middle of the day a cold wind

141
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
came through and like destroyed

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
a bunch of tomato plants when they were

143
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,478
young so i had to restart

144
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,000
a lot of them survived and it was just

145
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,519
two varieties

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,038
a sioux and uh

147
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,120
i can't remember what the other one was

148
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,439
but mainly just two varieties made it

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,478
this

150
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,918
and then i replanted a whole bunch

151
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,079
and look at these little guys playing

152
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,120
they're they're happy

153
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,758
out here this is chia

154
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,918
so yeah you got way too many tomatoes

155
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,919
now

156
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,680
i'll show you this little bird

157
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,240
this chicken had her neck ripped

158
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
by that bad rooster

159
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,439
and i had you can't get chickens worked

160
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,959
on because they uh

161
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,800
the vets that work on birds only do like

162
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,799
fancy birds like parrots and

163
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,319
uh geese and swans and stuff like that

164
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,840
they don't mess with chicken and duck

165
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,400
people

166
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,598
we're low class so we got to do stuff on

167
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,439
our own

168
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,079
and this little bird had her neck ripped

169
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,519
by that big bad rooster

170
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,318
and i had to super glue it back together

171
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,478
you can see

172
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,160
right here this is only not even two

173
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,478
weeks old and she's got

174
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
feathers growing back i don't know if

175
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,199
that's showing up on the camera or not

176
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,719
either but

177
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,840
these little feathers are coming back in

178
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,160
so there's blood going to it and she's

179
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:58,239
acting normal and happy so it worked

180
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,680
stitched her up with some super glue now

181
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,598
she's gonna come out here to have a day

182
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,840
by herself

183
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,839
all right y'all have a nice day too
