00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,678
hey everybody chad westport here today

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:15,359
we're going to have fun with a few what

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,160
if our first what if is what if

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:21,198
what if i topped the plant right here

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,359
discarding all of that above

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,039
and only keeping that below

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,279
do you think it would live

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,560
it's an awful lot to take off

10
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,320
but sometimes you have no choice so what

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,479
do you do

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,039
let's find out another fun thing that

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,718
we're gonna do with this

14
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,679
since we're gonna top it down here and

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,520
we've got all of that above

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,320
do you think if i put that in the arrow

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
cloner it will clone

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,640
i don't think so

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,640
but let's find out anyways okay so as

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,359
you can see i've got it all lined up to

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,320
be cut and i'm just going to pan up and

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,159
down so you can see once again the

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,319
ridiculousness of this cloning attempt

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,319
so let's pan up and check her out

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,960
and as you can see she's too tall to

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,319
flower out i kind of let her go this

27
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:22,319
long because i wanted to pre-sex her i

28
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,399
have determined that she is a she

29
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,399
through the pre flowers

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,118
i know that if i cut it back and play

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,280
around with it if it lives i'll get a

32
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,840
nice bush anyhow so

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
let's play

34
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,960
here we go

35
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,359
pick sticker out i'm gonna cut her at my

36
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,280
angle here right above the two branches

37
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,200
that i want to be the top

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
and

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,799
one two three

40
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,640
clone

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,680
oh it's so thick i can't even cut this

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,040
[ __ ]

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,640
oh my goodness

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
oh yeah all right

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,799
so right now this is a scraggly looking

46
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,478
plant i'm gonna train it i'm gonna clean

47
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,319
it up a little bit you'll see what it

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,879
looks like later but let's go check out

49
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,238
our monster clone

50
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,878
guys you can see the absolute absurdity

51
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,959
of this size of clone as i said earlier

52
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,399
there's a dozen good clones on there if

53
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,479
you really wanted to take a clone

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,920
they're in there not the one piece

55
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,079
but i've got it in the arrow cloner and

56
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,559
we're gonna find out if it works just

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,560
because go ahead and place your bets in

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,159
the comment we'll find out what happens

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,318
all right so you can see what i've done

60
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,639
with this plant is i've taken those

61
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,919
stems that were going up and i've bent

62
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,639
them down

63
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,518
that's going to serve a couple purposes

64
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,479
one

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,640
is these inner node spaces here here

66
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,119
here here all of these

67
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,439
the branches are going to grow up

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,439
that's going to fill this area in and

69
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,039
make it fairly bushy

70
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,840
the other thing i've done here is i've

71
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,199
used my binder

72
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,680
clips take them down

73
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,199
now because of phototropism

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,959
these are actually going to start to

75
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,280
curl back up

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,039
at the point that they're bound so this

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,878
is no longer going to stick down here

78
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,239
that's actually going to come back up

79
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,239
it's going to look for the light and

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,920
follow the light same with this one it's

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,840
going to curl back up

82
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,158
and it's going to be a nice bushy plant

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:32,199
and kind of stay within the confines of

84
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:32,199
the structure given by the plot or pot

85
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,679
we're about an hour into this monster

86
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,079
sitting in the clone machine and as you

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
can see i took some of the families off

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,000
that's just going to give it more of a

89
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,598
fighting chance too many leaves it's

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,239
going to transpire too much and there's

91
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,399
not enough water in the system so i'm

92
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,480
actually have expected the least to go

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
limp by now it's been you know like i

94
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,199
said it's been over an hour since i

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,360
cloned it uh they're still pretty turgid

96
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,598
there's enough water in the system we'll

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,159
see if it stays out holy crap guys it's

98
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,238
24 hours later and this thing is not

99
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,959
only still alive

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,878
it's looking more turgid and more water

101
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,319
pressure in there than when i cut it off

102
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,399
the plant

103
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:18,079
can this thing really be a true clone

104
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,159
we'll find out

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,639
so we're getting close to two weeks into

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,880
this after i've chopped the top off and

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
bent all of these all the way down

108
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,519
as you can see what i bent down is

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,639
starting to curl back up this was

110
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,639
way down there but again phototropism is

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,478
going to want to grow towards the light

112
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,639
they're all about the same height so i'm

113
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,879
controlling the apical dominance and all

114
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,720
the auxins and where all the priority is

115
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,560
going essentially

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,080
we've got these middle nodes that are

117
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,079
now starting to

118
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,279
put off their branches so these are

119
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,599
going to come

120
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,000
fill up the middle these will continue

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,919
to grow up around the side and hey at

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,720
the end of the day we're gonna have a

123
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,599
monster bush

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,639
oh my goodness you guys we are over a

125
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,879
week into this thing being chopped off

126
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,120
crudely by the scissors and stuffed in

127
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,159
this aeroponics machine

128
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,680
not only is it still alive

129
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,600
and not limp

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,240
all of the leaves are looking good

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,080
they're solid and

132
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,400
get this

133
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,800
this thing's starting to get roots

134
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,799
check it out

135
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,120
look at that guys

136
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,240
at that right there

137
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,240
that is just crazy do you guys think i'm

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,199
gonna be able to get enough roots

139
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,840
for this whole thing

140
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,600
to finish flowering

141
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:55,959
we'll have to see but i'm going to put

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,960
it back in the arrow cloner for now

143
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:05,860
