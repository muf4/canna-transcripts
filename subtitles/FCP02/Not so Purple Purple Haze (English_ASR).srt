1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
hey there hey it's Sunday October I

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,378
don't even know what day it is what is

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,240
it 23rd 23rd

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:12,058
um we're gonna do some field notes we're

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,219
now moving into our sativas so we're not

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:21,179
just doing Afghan anymore and this one

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:24,600
right here is actually Purple Haze uh so

8
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,698
um not we have a bunch of military jets

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,740
flying over our property right now so

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,439
sorry about the

11
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:35,119
sounds like we're in a war zone but

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,679
um anyway ignore them

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,140
uh this is uh

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,600
Purple Haze though

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,939
um very cool Plant incredibly chunky

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,100
buds we grew a few of them so I'll show

17
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,079
you this one first

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,539
um not quite sure about the purple I'm

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,539
not seeing any purple at all but

20
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,640
absolutely beautiful chunky buds so I'd

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,558
say they're just a few days away from

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,878
being ready to harvest

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,878
um the smell

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,140
it's just complex

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,839
sort of

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,200
different fruits and kind of rotten

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,299
fruits and melons and slightly rotten

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,780
melons

29
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:21,380
so just a really complex melange of

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,280
different fruits and rotting fruit

31
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:25,280
with a little bit of spice

32
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,920
yeah

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,540
very bizarre very interesting I'm very

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,960
excited about this so this is uh the

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,360
Purple Haze which I believe the story on

36
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,699
this is It's originated out of Santa

37
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,879
Cruz so it's actually this is almost

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,159
like a land race a Santa Cruz land race

39
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,000
so um kind of cool oh and then let's

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,000
look at the other one

41
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,640
uh

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,920
so here's another Purple Haze so yeah it

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,579
seems to be right on schedule

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,920
this one yeah it's about ready as well

45
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,899
and then the feeding requirements on

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
this was yeah I probably could uh

47
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,920
handled a little more nitrogen next year

48
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,359
we're going to have bigger root space

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,459
area

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
um but you know I never want to risk

51
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,598
over feeding

52
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,939
um so anyway it looks looks just about

53
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,479
right but very nice and then we have a

54
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,479
third one

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,080
uh

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,259
anyway it's all the way up there in the

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,719
corner do you see that so it's on

58
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,560
schedule as well and it's dark well

59
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,560
let's just go up there

60
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,180
because this one actually I think this

61
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,039
one's the furthest along so let's take a

62
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,500
look at this

63
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,719
starting to get some brown hairs

64
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,680
and just yeah

65
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,680
let me see what the smell

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,180
yeah this has more melon like a musk

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,180
melon

68
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,340
uh situation going on but yeah anyway

69
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,920
Purple Haze very cool it's basically

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,900
like a Santa Cruz land race so I'm

71
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,280
excited to grow it and

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,920
there it is and I think we're gonna

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,340
Harvest probably this week

74
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,339
anyway bye
