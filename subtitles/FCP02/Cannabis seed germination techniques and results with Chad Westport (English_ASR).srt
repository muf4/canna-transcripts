00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,800
hello fellow growers this is chad

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,199
westport and today

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,400
we're going to pop some seeds or get

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,038
some beans soaked

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,719
or as the scientist guys would say we're

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,800
going to germinate some seeds

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,399
i'm here to show you probably the most

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,240
common ways that people are going to

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,879
germinate their seeds

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,839
today we are going to do some rockwool

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,879
cubes

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,759
we are going to do direct so into some

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,159
soil

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,000
we are going to do the paper towel

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,039
method and the paper towel method can be

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,799
done a couple ways

18
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,799
you could put it between two paper

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,919
plates or you could put it in some

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,479
ziploc bags

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,120
so we'll do both of those uh over here

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,279
we've got

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,558
just some jars we're gonna fill those

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
with our ph

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,439
water uh ph it to 6.5

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
that might not be important to everybody

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,320
to me it is so

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,160
ph 6.5 water to pop my seeds and over

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
here i got a variety of seeds

30
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,238
for genetics the new ones i have right

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,960
now i've got an afghani times the dutch

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,200
treat

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,640
i've got the afghani back cross those

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,240
are the new ones those are the ones i

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,799
expect a really high germination rate

36
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,199
from

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,960
i'm also testing some of my older gear

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,439
i've got a harlequin time

39
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,118
secret sauce and secret sauce isn't

40
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,239
really a strain that's just my secret

41
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,640
sauce

42
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,359
i've got a northern lights number five

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,599
chimes

44
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,640
go time which was from jinx proof

45
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,959
genetics

46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,960
i've also got a jax cleaner too which

47
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,519
was from tga genetics

48
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,599
times that to my secret sauce then i got

49
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:40,399
a really big bag here

50
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,959
of okay uh secret sauce times the agent

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,359
jack

52
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,640
that's the one i've got a whole bunch of

53
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,478
uh the agent jack

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,599
is a f1 cross of tga's agent orange and

55
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,118
jax cleaner too

56
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,719
so i want to see what germination rate i

57
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,078
get from those

58
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,319
first i'm going to show you the water

59
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,399
soaking method before we do that though

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,078
i want to stress the importance of

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,239
accurate labeling

62
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,118
i've got all of my little containers

63
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,399
labeled a b

64
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,719
c d through f i've got them all written

65
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,199
down here corresponding what the strains

66
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,919
are

67
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,238
the year that they were made that way i

68
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,079
know

69
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,520
what is what later and that is so

70
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
important when you're testing because

71
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
you don't want to get these things

72
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,719
confused

73
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,120
uh but hey the simple method of cracking

74
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,439
them

75
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,120
in water the soaking method you're just

76
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,400
going to take your container

77
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,239
i'm going to fill it with a little bit

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,840
of ph water

79
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,519
you don't need it super deep you know

80
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,959
i'm filling this maybe halfway and

81
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,439
that's fine

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,840
just going to do that you're gonna take

83
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,800
your seeds

84
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,840
gonna grab a pinch here and i'm just

85
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
gonna drop them in

86
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,400
one two three four five

87
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,560
six seven and as you see

88
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,239
right now they are floating around

89
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,318
they're in the center and we'll see if

90
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:05,840
they sink and open so let's go ahead and

91
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:05,839
do that to all of the other seeds

92
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,560
and there you go everything is soaking

93
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,080
now and we're just going to let that

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,878
overnight to see if they keep

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,719
floating or if they sink and when they

96
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,759
sink hopefully they open up and they

97
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,919
sprout a tail

98
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,280
that's how you germinate seeds just in

99
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,280
water the soak method

100
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,639
now i'm going to show you the rockwool

101
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,000
method before i do that though i just

102
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,839
want to show you something simple

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
again i've gone ahead and i've labeled

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,439
everything

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,878
everything needs to be labeled and i've

106
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,840
poked my own holes

107
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,479
through the rock wool pretty simple two

108
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,560
holes

109
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,518
each side gives me two tests on the

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,280
beans in

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,560
the rock wool so i've got my ph water

112
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,560
it's going to give them a nice soak

113
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,438
you don't want to get them too soaked

114
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
you still want there to be some air in

115
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,120
there yes

116
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
this is nice you could kind of squeeze

117
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,438
it you get a feel for how saturated they

118
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
are

119
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,919
that way

120
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,079
yeah perfect perfect happy combination

121
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,680
so again yeah i'm just going to take my

122
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,358
seeds i'm going to start plugging my way

123
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,120
in there

124
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,000
and i want to say before we put the

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,918
seeds in here the seeds have a side with

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,478
a dimple it's usually the fatter bottom

127
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,000
part

128
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,758
and then the side where it kind of comes

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,478
to the point that's usually the skinnier

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,240
part

131
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,758
now when you're putting them into the

132
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,840
rock wool or soil

133
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,360
just like this you want to put them with

134
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,478
the skinny part down

135
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,319
so dimple up that is going to help it

136
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,918
come up and grow out of the medium

137
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,519
so i'm just going to tuck it right down

138
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,799
in there and i'm actually going to give

139
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,639
it just a gentle

140
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,840
little tap down into the rock wool

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,840
with my skewer

142
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,359
and now repeat

143
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,400
now i'm only shoving them down maybe an

144
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
eighth of an inch

145
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,839
not deep at all

146
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,119
and there you go that is how to put

147
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:28,239
seeds into rockwool for germination

148
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,720
now let's do directly into the soil

149
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,478
i've got it uh split up and marked out

150
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,080
i've got it labeled up here

151
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,240
as far as what we're doing again you

152
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,038
want to make sure you keep track of what

153
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
is where

154
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,639
so you know what kind of results you're

155
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
getting okay i'm just going to

156
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
gently water this a little bit with my

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,720
ph

158
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,080
it's ph to 6.5 water again i don't want

159
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
to soak it because

160
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:54,319
the seeds gonna need some oxygen

161
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,038
but i want it wet enough to uh crack

162
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,038
that hole

163
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,639
okay so that's probably good and i'm

164
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,599
gonna do two seeds

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,720
per quadrant here so i'm just gonna poke

166
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,479
a little hole

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:10,400
poke a little hole

168
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:13,120
and that is quadrant f okay

169
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,198
make sure i get the right ones in there

170
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,399
and again when you put the seed directly

171
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,038
into the soil

172
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,318
you want that side with the dimple you

173
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,599
want that side

174
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,000
facing up so the sharp pointy side you

175
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,039
want

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,600
down into the soil general rule of thumb

177
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,719
is you're going to plant the seed twice

178
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,800
of its width

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,479
so if you have a seed that's basically a

180
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,240
16 inch wide

181
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,519
you're going to bury an eighth of an

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,199
inch deep so

183
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,799
not very deep especially for the

184
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,199
cannabis seeds

185
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,960
put it in there like so take this one

186
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,000
put it in there like so i'm just gonna

187
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,318
tamp it in oops

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,680
that one flipped around on me again i

189
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,080
want to make sure i get it the right way

190
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,079
down

191
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,918
a little bugger

192
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,400
okay then i'm just going to kind of

193
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,680
gently give it a little hug with the

194
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,638
soil

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,639
i'm not going to bury it deep again but

196
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,918
i do want contact with the soil and a

197
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,918
little something over it

198
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:31,839
okay so that's that side and i'm

199
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:31,839
basically just going to repeat

200
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,839
and there you go that is popping seeds

201
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,360
in

202
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,119
soil the paper plate method

203
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,960
all you're basically doing is putting

204
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,560
the seeds in the paper towel and then

205
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,079
covering it up with the paper plate to

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,240
create sort of a

207
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,758
humidity dome if you will i've already

208
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
got these already laid out and as you

209
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,759
can see they're labeled

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,598
you can see the seeds on the back and

211
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,439
let me show you how to do this basically

212
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:07,519
you just want to take your paper towel

213
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:11,680
your ph water get it soaked

214
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,519
ring it out a little bit unfold it onto

215
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,439
your plate

216
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,079
this is always the hard part getting it

217
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,079
separated

218
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,598
okay there we go separated there

219
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,038
you take your seeds you put them in

220
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,479
there and they don't need to face any

221
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,000
special direction

222
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,320
because you're just going to fold this

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
over

224
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,479
kind of tuck them in get them nice make

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,958
sure they have contact

226
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,440
i'm gonna fold it over again stay nice

227
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,439
and wet

228
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:55,039
boom take this

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,639
put it over there

230
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,159
there you go you got the paper plate

231
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,679
method for popping seats

232
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,919
we'll finish up here with the paper

233
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,958
towel method which again is very similar

234
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,039
to the

235
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,479
paper plate method you're essentially

236
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,319
getting your paper towel

237
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,240
you're putting a little bit of that ph

238
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,360
water on it

239
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,039
let it soak in okay

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,200
now the hard part is separating your

241
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:26,480
paper towel when it's wet

242
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,519
oh i got it okay

243
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,519
then roll that there

244
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,559
okay so i've got that done i'm gonna

245
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,199
take my seeds and again they don't need

246
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,879
to go in

247
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,399
any specific direction some people will

248
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,879
actually take the ziploc

249
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,360
bags and hang them upside down because

250
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,240
the root will grow down they are

251
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,200
in touch with gravity gravitropism i

252
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
believe it is

253
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
some fancy word but yeah the roots will

254
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,320
want to grow down but

255
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,519
if you lay horizontally not a big deal

256
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,760
for this portion

257
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,440
so i take my wet paper towel it's got

258
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,039
the seeds in there

259
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,640
they got a nice little hug so there's

260
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:10,078
contact there

261
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:13,679
take that slide that into my

262
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,639
zip lock bag try to keep everything nice

263
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,120
and separated

264
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,639
and i don't actually seal it but i do

265
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
kind of keep it closed

266
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,799
because as you can see on the one i did

267
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,959
earlier there's a little bit of moisture

268
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,679
and condensation building up around it

269
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,679
and that will keep them kind of moist my

270
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,159
room temperature right now is about 70

271
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,319
degrees

272
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,719
i do not need to use a heat mat if you

273
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,120
do use a heat mat if it was the winter i

274
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
would

275
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,320
if you use a heat mat don't put these

276
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,838
directly on the heat mat

277
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,000
because it's going to dry out the paper

278
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,760
towel it's going to be a little bit too

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,078
hot for that fresh seed

280
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,838
so just raise it or elevate it a little

281
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,278
bit off of the heat mat

282
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,279
and i always recommend that even if

283
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,159
you're doing clones so that's just good

284
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,439
practice

285
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,199
you want to keep these in a dark area

286
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
lights not necessarily going to hurt the

287
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,480
seed but light and water that can lead

288
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,200
to algae

289
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,519
the molds that can hurt the fresh seed

290
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
so

291
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,519
yeah just keep them somewhere relatively

292
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
dark relatively warm

293
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:15,839
we'll leave it like that and we'll check

294
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,839
in with them soon

295
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,239
okay here we are 24 hours later i'm

296
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
looking at all of the seeds and all of

297
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,839
the seeds

298
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
have sunk to the bottom of the jars so

299
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,640
that's a good sign

300
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,559
hopefully next thing is they will be

301
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,720
opening up for us as you can see

302
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,639
the three seeds here in the water have

303
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
cracked they've opened up and the tail

304
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,799
is starting to come out

305
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,159
these are ready to be placed into the

306
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,759
soil

307
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,919
all right so i'm going to go ahead and

308
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,559
put one of these seeds into the soil for

309
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,199
you

310
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,479
and i have tweezers to do that you want

311
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
to be gentle you don't have to use

312
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,800
tweezers but

313
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,399
i like to use them especially when

314
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,679
getting them out of the water just makes

315
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,720
it easier for me

316
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,958
so i'm just going to reach into here

317
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,240
get my seed and again you want to be

318
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,759
careful you don't want to

319
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,079
pinch it on the white part the white

320
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,278
part is sensitive

321
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,239
this is the tail the tap root and you

322
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,879
want to put that

323
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,600
down into the soil and another thing i

324
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,399
like to do when starting a seed in soil

325
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,079
is here's the top of my pot i have it

326
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,600
kind of carved out here

327
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,000
i'm going to put the seed down here in

328
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
the bottom i'm not going to bury it

329
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
too deep i'm actually only going to bury

330
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,440
it maybe an eighth of an inch

331
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,519
but what this allows the seed to do is

332
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,600
it allows it to get leggy and spread

333
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,839
up and then you can backfill giving it

334
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,920
more support because sometimes seeds

335
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,519
they stretch up this is a way to give

336
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,120
them support in the pot

337
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:43,039
so i have it i'm gonna put it here

338
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,039
again i'm gonna get the point down

339
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,159
let's put a little soil over it and

340
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,278
there you go it's in

341
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,879
the soil looking here

342
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,200
at the seeds that we put in the paper

343
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,278
towels two of these three have already

344
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,480
opened up their tails are coming out

345
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,399
and i'm going to take them out of the

346
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,360
paper towel so that the

347
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,480
roots don't grow into it and get damaged

348
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,919
when you transfer

349
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,680
i'm going to take them out right now and

350
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,199
i'm going to put them into my soil

351
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,958
and then i'm going to tuck it back in

352
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,519
and let that other seed stay in here and

353
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,518
pop for another day

354
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,440
we're five days into it now after we put

355
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,000
the seeds into either our soil our

356
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,240
rockwool

357
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,679
our water or our paper towels and now

358
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
we're just going to take a look and see

359
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,719
what we

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,679
have after five days you should your

361
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,920
seed should have

362
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,479
cracked and opened a tail you hope to

363
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,240
see that within 24 to 48 hours

364
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,639
sometimes it could go as long as seven

365
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,360
days maybe even as long as 10

366
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,320
but really after that point there might

367
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,000
not be too much vigor in the plant so

368
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,440
get a new seed get something that's

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,879
going to crack get something that's

370
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
going to grow pretty fast

371
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,639
so let's take a look at these paper

372
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,399
towels in the ziploc bag which is

373
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,720
typically my preferred method

374
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,440
and you'll notice here as i flip this

375
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,240
over

376
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,920
there's condensation which helped keep

377
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
the moisture in here the whole time i

378
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,159
never had to add any water to it

379
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,319
i just kept it in the warm place so

380
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:06,000
paper towel method in the ziploc bag

381
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,000
let's open it up and see what we get

382
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,559
here we have our results from the paper

383
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,679
towel in the plastic bag

384
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:17,439
uh a this is an old strain

385
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,759
not good results o for five um

386
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,920
b was three for three that was a new

387
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,720
strain i already put that into the soil

388
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,240
i took those out after 48 hours i just

389
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,680
kind of let these go to see what would

390
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,600
happen and to kind of give you an

391
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,479
example of why you don't do this because

392
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,040
it grows through the paper towel

393
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
but see this is an old strain i have

394
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,759
about six years old

395
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,639
it is three of three those cracked d

396
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,519
is another old strain that uh this one

397
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,959
got a nice

398
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,078
nice big root on it uh these two didn't

399
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,919
crack though

400
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:54,399
uh e another old strain no action there

401
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,919
f this is a new strain that i have and

402
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,600
this is three for three

403
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,799
and again guys i should have taken this

404
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,399
out uh 48 hours into it because they

405
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,159
have grown through the paper towel

406
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,399
and you want to be gentle on these roots

407
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:12,000
but i will show you later how to easily

408
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,759
get around this issue so there we have

409
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,039
it pretty good results let's go and

410
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,879
check the paper towel

411
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:21,439
in the plate method oh no

412
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,679
checking everything 24 hours into it and

413
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,720
my paper plate is dry

414
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,958
needs more water gotta do that now

415
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,759
so learning from that mistake quickly i

416
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,638
replaced

417
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,720
the paper plate on the bottom with

418
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,440
something that's not going to absorb

419
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
the water because again this absorb the

420
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,079
water

421
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,519
the paper towels dried out that was no

422
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,319
good you need them

423
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,198
wet to pop your seeds so i put them in

424
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
this

425
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,240
i've got them wet let's open it up and

426
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,240
let's see what we got

427
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,278
here are the results of our paper towel

428
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,078
in the plate method

429
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:01,039
nothing going on with this old strain

430
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,758
this new strain we got a nice tail here

431
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,000
one out of three uh here's the old

432
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,000
strain i have it got a tail got a tail

433
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,559
so two out of three there

434
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,799
um two out of three here this one's

435
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,838
getting a longer tail you can see that

436
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,479
there

437
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,240
uh that one didn't crack um nothing

438
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
going on with these

439
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,240
and then this one which is a newer one

440
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,360
three out of three but i wanted to show

441
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,159
you here

442
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,959
why it's important that you take uh

443
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,198
these out

444
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,879
after they sprout a little tail you know

445
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,278
right now you can still you can still

446
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,639
manage these you could grab them

447
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,838
you could take them you could put them

448
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,519
into your soil you could do whatever

449
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,600
i'm just going to shake those off right

450
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,839
now put those there

451
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
and this is why you want to take them

452
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,079
out because this

453
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,519
has actually grown through the paper

454
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,799
towel

455
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,000
so you know you don't want to damage the

456
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,519
roots when you're putting them in in

457
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,720
this case what i would do is i would

458
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,919
just kind of split

459
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,920
the paper towel here

460
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:06,000
and i have my access to it but again

461
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,880
you want to do as little touching and

462
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
damage to these as possible

463
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,079
and there you have it those are the

464
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,640
results from the plate with the paper

465
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,678
towels

466
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,079
let's see how it stacks up

467
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,959
now we'll look at our direct sows the

468
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,318
first direct so we have is our direcso

469
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,880
into soil

470
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,599
and i've got it all labeled here what

471
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,360
they are

472
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:31,359
gritted out easy to keep track of

473
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,639
again kind of seeing a common theme here

474
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,839
with results

475
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,360
a and e both older seeds

476
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,119
not having the best time with

477
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:43,038
germination but

478
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:46,639
my newer strains we've got the b

479
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,839
two for two right here and we got f2 for

480
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,759
two right here

481
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,199
so again the newer strains are coming in

482
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,359
at a hundred percent

483
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,279
and the other two older strains i have

484
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,439
here one for two

485
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,279
one for two so that's kind of holding

486
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,000
steady as well

487
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,720
that's the direct so into the soil

488
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
results

489
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,200
let's check out the direct so into

490
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,200
rockwool

491
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,639
and i'd just like to add that normally i

492
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,359
wouldn't put this many seeds in one

493
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,320
container

494
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:16,000
i only do one seed per one container but

495
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,359
this was a germination test this was

496
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,279
about seeing what popped up

497
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,399
this wasn't about growing these plants

498
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,480
any further

499
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,720
than this stage that they're getting to

500
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,360
so that's why i have so many

501
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,558
in one little space and the same holds

502
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,199
true for the rock wheel

503
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,279
you know one seed one space that's how i

504
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,279
rock it

505
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,119
now we get a chance to look at our rock

506
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,558
wool which is another method of direct

507
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,479
sowing into a medium

508
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,079
we just placed our seeds in there and

509
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,720
this isn't really a method that i

510
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,000
use i don't use rockwool frequently but

511
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,079
it is something that people

512
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,640
do so i thought i'd include it in my

513
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,079
germination tests

514
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,000
getting a little bit different results

515
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,439
with this one thing that is holding true

516
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
is my newer strains

517
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,600
excellent results they're both 100

518
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,558
percent you got two for two here

519
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,399
on what i labeled as the b strain and

520
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:08,079
then i also have two for two

521
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,080
here of the f strain uh all of the other

522
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,839
strains the older strains

523
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,439
they didn't have as good of results in

524
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,720
the rock wool as they did with some of

525
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,240
the other methods

526
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,319
one thing i do want to mention about

527
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,798
rockwool though is sometimes

528
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,839
you'll see the seeds in here at top it

529
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,000
may not

530
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,879
look like it popped but if you flip it

531
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,279
over

532
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,400
all of a sudden you see kind of like a

533
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,119
tap root

534
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,640
sitting in here so sometimes again

535
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,798
sometimes it looks like it didn't pop

536
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,480
because it's not growing up like this

537
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,000
but you flip it over and you see that

538
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,200
hey instead of growing up it just kind

539
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,440
of grew down

540
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,798
and you've got your root anyways so just

541
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,240
something to keep an eye on

542
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,240
with the rock wool and there you have it

543
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,000
after 48 hours i pulled a couple beans

544
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,000
that had already

545
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,119
cracked out of the water as well as the

546
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,960
paper towels

547
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,479
and i put them into soil because i just

548
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,120
wanted to make sure that they

549
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,880
were going to finish the job and so they

550
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,479
did again i have them marked here these

551
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,679
are the two new strains that i've been

552
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,880
doing

553
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,240
all three from the

554
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,760
uh water that cracked popped up

555
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,319
the two that i took out of the paper

556
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,960
towel earlier those have popped up as

557
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,200
well

558
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,240
and i even took some out of the water

559
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,558
for b

560
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,400
and they're coming up too i got one two

561
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,480
three four of those popping up

562
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,240
and again no way would i normally put

563
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,240
this many plants in one container

564
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,079
but this was about germination and i

565
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,798
just wanted to follow the job through

566
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,480
and make sure it completed its job of

567
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,879
popping up above ground

568
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,240
so there you have it guys i think my

569
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,679
results are in

570
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,440
a paper towel in a ziploc bag

571
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,679
followed by direct sew into soil

572
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,600
those were the two statistically most

573
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,240
effective methods

574
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,639
overall the new strains ones that i

575
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,839
would

576
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,480
expect to have germination rate they all

577
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,079
performed

578
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,919
equally the f was 100 the b

579
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:09,599
uh 14 of 16 i believe it was

580
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:13,440
and it had two problems with the

581
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,839
uh paper towel in the plate method so

582
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,120
overall great results on germination

583
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:22,000
from my newer strains the older strains

584
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,798
decent not so yeah whatever it is what

585
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,359
it is

586
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,679
but there you go guys that is kind of a

587
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,399
overall tutorial on how you can

588
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,840
germinate in a variety of different

589
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,919
methods so my name is chad westport

590
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,038
thank you for joining us i am from twin

591

peaks cannabis

592
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,079
and i hope to see you again on the

593
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,990
perfectly imperfect grow show

594
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:57,899
thank you

595
