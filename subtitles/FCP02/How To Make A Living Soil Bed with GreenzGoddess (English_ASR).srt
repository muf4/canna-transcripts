[Music]

2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,199
so

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,719
hey friends greens goddess here uh today

4
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:17,920
i'm going to put together another 3x6

5
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:20,079
foot fabric pop bed and i just wanted to

6
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,920
share with you guys how i'm doing it in

7
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,400
case if you wanted to start growing your

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,799
own cannabis medicine from home you

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,280
could go with pots or you could go with

10
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,040
a nice big fabric pot bed if you're

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
going to decide to go with a nice big

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,000
fabric pop bed let me show you how to

13
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,599
set it up so first of all

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,959
we got a nice

15
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,839
three by six foot fabric pop bed i got

16
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,959
this from buildasoil.com

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,719
um it's made by grassroots

18
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,798
the first thing that you want to do when

19
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,399
you're setting up a bed is to prepare

20
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,520
for what's going to go underneath

21
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,000
because you're probably going to

22
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,280
experience some water runoff so what i

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
built was

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,960
a bed frame and it looks like this it's

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,920
made by two by fours

26
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,399
it's uh 78 inches

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
in length and these ones are 35 inches

28
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,959
in width

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,040
and then i got this material

30
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,520
to help all of the rain water come down

31
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,318
to one area

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,439
when i go to set up my frame see it

33
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,519
looks like this on the floor

34
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,759
one thing that you want to keep in mind

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,400
on one end you're going to have a little

36
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,479
lip over the edge of this so that way

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
the water can go over the lip and it

38
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,000
could collect into a tray in case if you

39
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,799
water too much and then at the other end

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
i made one of these things it's just to

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,439
lift it up

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,680
um give it a few two inches on one end

43
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,639
so in case if the water comes down it'll

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,800
all go out the other end so

45
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,759
what i'm going to do is just lift this

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,519
end up

47
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,158
slide that underneath

48
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,439
then i'm going to go ahead

49
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:04,158
and take my huge fabric pop bed

50
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:08,158
and put it on top

51
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,158
i already built the whole thing together

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
see how nicely it fits on top of there

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
it's perfect

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,479
with these measurements you get like a

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,680
few extra inches on each side

56
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,840
so when you buy this fabric potbed

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
it comes with these pieces it comes with

58
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,799
these pieces

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,560
but what you want to do

60
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,840
it actually comes with these pieces for

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,439
your corners you're going to want to get

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,280
the upgrade

63
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,719
which gets you this piece if you don't

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
have it at your local lowe's or home

65
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,158
depot store

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,719
this piece you could put another pvc

67
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,120
pipe going up and that'll be your frame

68
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,359
that you would put your trellis on

69
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,519
so let me give you the measurements

70
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
because if you're to buy

71
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
the fabric pop bed three by six from

72
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,239
build a soil they don't come

73
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,399
with a one inch pvc pipe you got to go

74
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
to the store and get it yourself if

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,879
you're going to do that you want to take

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,360
cuttings and i have it all written down

77
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,359
right here

78
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,878
um for your 3x6 fabric pop bed you're

79
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,518
going to need 1 inch pvc pipe for your

80
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:18,000
legs you're gonna want four legs

81
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,199
uh cut at 17 inches

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,040
the length there's four sides

83
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,120
one two three four

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,199
those are going to be cut at 32 and a

85
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
half inches and then for your width

86
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
you're going to want two pieces at 31

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
inches so

88
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,478
in case if you're wanting to make your

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
own bed

90
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,120
that's how you cut your pvc pipe and it

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,720
all goes together like that see

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
now we're going to fill it let me show

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,960
you what i got

94
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,959
following leighton's advice about the

95
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,758
soil horizons first we're going to start

96
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,758
with rocks

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,519
then we're going to come in with some

98
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,159
sand that i collected from the beach

99
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,918
during my most recent trip to california

100
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
including crushed oyster shells

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,360
i got natural soil from my backyard

102
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,680
i even went out to the mountains and

103
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,600
connect collected some natural soil from

104
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,079
there

105
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,320
over here i have like these are sticks

106
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,319
old sticks from old harvest these are

107
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,439
leaves from my avocado tree when they

108
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,680
died off these are old avocado pieces

109
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,478
from old avocado tech

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,918
so

111
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,599
that's all going to go in your middle

112
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,439
layer

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,000
your very top layer is going to be your

114
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,918
coot's mix

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
i got another video how showing how to

116
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,478
put your coots mixed together you could

117
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,759
use anybody's mix that you want to use

118
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,439
you don't even have to make your own if

119
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,639
you don't want to if you want you could

120
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,839
buy somebody else's i'm just showing you

121
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,840
how i fill my beds

122
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,839
there's good snacks

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,600
smells very nice

124
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,839
right

125
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,919
let's get started

126
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,239
because i've been waiting all weekend to

127
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,318
fill this bed i just wanted to make sure

128
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,519
i had all of my material so that i could

129
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,439
show you guys how to do it

130
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,120
okay so the first thing i'm going to do

131
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,879
is i'm going to go ahead and lift up

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,879
this side and put that um

133
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,400
stand underneath it so that way we know

134
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319
this side of the bed is going to lift up

135
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,478
in case if there's any extra water it's

136
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,960
all going to come out towards the front

137
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:24,959
of the room

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,360
think about when you're doing this where

139
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,918
you want to position your bed in the

140
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,680
room once you fill it there's like no

141
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,519
going back it's going to be full and

142
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,120
it's going to be really heavy

143
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,159
all right and i make sure that i got my

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,120
fabric pot in the center of my frame

145
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,520
perfect we're ready to rock and roll

146
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,240
first thing i want to do

147
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,318
is throw down some rocks and you go wild

148
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,478
crafting for rocks

149
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,319
what you want to look for is smaller

150
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,079
pieces like this

151
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,598
about an inch

152
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,279
these pieces are a bit too big but

153
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,000
that one's got a lot of beautiful

154
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,239
granite minerals in it

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,478
i only have about like a small handful

156
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
pieces this big the majority of my

157
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,680
pieces are small

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,918
like this

159
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,478
the first layer is going to be all of

160
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,478
your rocks

161
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,639
first

162
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,539
[Applause]

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,360
your first layer only needs to be a

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,759
couple of inches tall

165
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,439
maybe about three four inches tall not

166
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,038
too crazy

167
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,319
if you're looking at your fabric pot

168
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,560
beds

169
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,879
you'll see where there's a white

170
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,000
thing here helps keep in the moisture

171
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,319
and the water

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,120
underneath that at the very bottom

173
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,840
probably about three or four inches so

174
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,759
think about your rock layer being a

175
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:13,000
little bit less than that definitely not

176
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,000
going over

177
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,598
there we go

178
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,139
two bucketfuls is definitely not enough

179
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,840
rocks

180
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,959
[Music]

181
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,839
i'm gonna have to go out and get some

182
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,839
more rocks

183
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,399
you wanna make sure that your whole

184
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,158
entire bottom layer of your bed is

185
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,599
completely filled with one inch rocks

186
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,240
okay so

187
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,479
i had to go back and get more rocks

188
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
but here they are

189
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,800
see how it's like completely covering

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,800
the bottom

191
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,360
the next thing i'm going to add is some

192
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,559
sand

193
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,000
so your very very bottom layer

194
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,559
is going to be

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,559
rocks and sand

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,320
i like that that one has the oyster

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,240
shells in it i got this down

198
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
from my most recent trip back home to

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
santa cruz

200
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,920
so it means a lot to me i also found

201
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,360
like this floating driftwood it looks

202
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,240
like a rock but it's actually really

203
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,839
wood

204
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,200
and it was floating in the sea i thought

205
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,240
it was awesome it's probably going to be

206
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
filled with

207
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,720
all sorts of nutrients from the sea

208
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,120
and plus when you put wood in your beds

209
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,440
in the organic layer it provides a nice

210
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,959
food source for a fungi which you want a

211
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,200
lot of fungi in your soil when you're

212
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,199
going

213
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,760
canvas more sand along these edges

214
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,639
just to kind of get it nice and even

215
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,080
let me show you guys what i'm talking

216
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,240
about

217
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,000
let's see

218
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,360
so i'm just going to spread it out like

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,679
this

220
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,519
so now this layer

221
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,479
is rocks and sand

222
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,480
that's your bottom layer

223
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,320
see how i'm just kind of spreading it

224
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,639
out

225
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,640
to the corners

226
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,680
making sure that it covers depending on

227
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,879
where you live you'll be able to

228
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:34,799
wildcraft a lot of this stuff naturally

229
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,799
i live out here in colorado so

230
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:42,000
i got clay soil i don't got a sandy soil

231
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,759
so sands all at the bottom

232
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,759
make sure you spread it out nice

233
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,120
and then after you spread it out you get

234
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,559
it nice and wet with just a little bit

235
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,560
of water like the sprayer

236
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,439
i'm using um the shower setting on my

237
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,879
sprayer

238
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
just to get it a little bit wet

239
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,239
kind of helps compact everything down if

240
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,720
you just spray it very lightly when you

241
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,720
do each layer

242
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,278
that's good nothing too much

243
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,759
all right so your next layer is going to

244
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,679
be your organic material

245
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,679
now what i have is a bunch of um

246
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,479
i have a bunch of old pots i've been

247
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,879
doing living soil in the same pots for a

248
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,879
couple of years now so these pots have

249
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,278
seen a lot of runs they already have

250
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,600
worms they already have high voice

251
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,159
smiles and nematodes

252
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,920
um they're pretty much

253
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,000
mainly uh

254
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,838
possibly just worm castings at the

255
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
bottom of these pots since they're so

256
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,000
small like 10 gallons and i've been

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,480
reusing them so many times this is why i

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,958
decided to go with a larger bed because

259
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,440
if i'm going to be reusing my soil i

260
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,599
want to have a much bigger

261
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,360
area for everything to grow and move

262
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,959
around in versus having all these

263
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,399
individual little pots that i have to

264
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:15,359
keep picking up and moving this way

265
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,600
um you just grow the plant from the time

266
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,639
it's this big to the time it's ready to

267
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,720
harvest

268
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,480
no picking up and moving things from one

269
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,120
room to the other room

270
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,680
so let me bring in my pots and i'll go

271
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,639
over all that

272
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:34,078
this was old 10 gallon pot

273
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
reused many many times

274
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,599
it's had it's been amended it's got tons

275
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,879
of castings it's had cover crops it's

276
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,879
had mulch all over it

277
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,120
this is going to be my organic layer

278
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,959
these old pots

279
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,519
and i'm also gonna throw

280
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,039
some old branches from old harvest that

281
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,440
wood that we were talking about earlier

282
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,439
before the fungi

283
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,278
this is still soaking wet at the bottom

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,958
and

285
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,720
i haven't even watered it in a couple

286
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,799
days because there were no plants in it

287
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
but um

288
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,479
let me show you what my first one looks

289
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,480
like

290
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,079
you see how wet it is

291
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,360
but oh man if you smell this it smells

292
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,239
amazing

293
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,639
this

294
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,879
i've always used coot's mix you could

295
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,879
use whoever's mix that you want

296
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,838
you could go to the store and buy a mix

297
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,879
there's a few companies that sell good

298
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,120
mix all ready to go like build a soil

299
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,159
um

300
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,159
who else big farms oh i found a

301
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,719
a worm

302
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,719
big roots

303
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,838
do you see this guy

304
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:03,198
they need to wake up

305
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,479
so i got three of those that i'm going

306
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,479
to put at the bottom of here

307
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,680
and then we'll see how full it gets

308
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,639
okay now we're back

309
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,879
um

310
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,639
okay first of all let me show you guys

311
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:24,559
what i did i got my um three

312
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,240
old soil pots that have been retailed

313
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,239
recycled over and over and over again

314
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,480
that's gonna make up my organic layer

315
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,560
the three pots three 10 gallon pot so

316
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,480
that's 30 gallons total

317
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,198
um this is what it looks like it's

318
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,680
pretty wet pretty moist in here i got

319
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:43,599
like my worms

320
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,439
my beneficial bugs i already got my um

321
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,159
organic

322
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,120
microbials growing one more thing i

323
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,759
wanted

324
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,519
to let you guys know um the funny thing

325
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:58,958
is while i was spreading this out

326
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,759
i happened to come across the corner and

327
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:04,479
i told you guys about putting a lip here

328
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:09,600
so that way water could come out

329
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,959
and um what i did was i sliced my foot

330
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,278
going across the corner here and i had

331
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,479
to go to the hospital to get stitches

332
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,519
and i'm thinking

333
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,519
i could have gotten this bed done

334
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,039
hours ago but i had to put everything on

335
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,480
hold to go to the hospital and get

336
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,639
stitches and i'm sitting there thinking

337
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
you want to if i'm gonna make a video

338
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,839
showing everybody how to do this a

339
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,600
certain way

340
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,279
i mean at least let it be me who gets

341
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,440
the stitches so i could warn everybody

342
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,439
so it's not them i don't want you guys

343
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,480
copying what i do and getting hurt from

344
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,920
it so

345
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,680
let me show you what i should have done

346
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,120
this corner

347
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,278
i'm gonna get my favorite pair of

348
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,120
scissors

349
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,120
and i'm just going to cut a curve

350
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,399
save that piece throw it in the garbage

351
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,360
don't want to step on it

352
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,240
and now i have a rounded corner

353
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,480
no more slices on my ankle

354
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,959
no more visits to the doctor's office

355
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,240
please then i'm gonna get duct tape just

356
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,239
for added measure

357
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
almost happen again did you guys see

358
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,839
that jeez

359
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
okay i'm gonna pin this down and i'm

360
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,680
going to put duct tape all along the

361
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,600
edge here as long as it's sticking out

362
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,679
of the wood you're going to want to tape

363
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,360
it up

364
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,519
and i'm going to put it all along the

365
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,800
front edge too

366
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,799
two pieces just to be safe

367
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,078
doesn't have to be perfect it just has

368
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,679
to get the job done of not injuring

369
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,239
yourself

370
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,000
as you're trying to work

371
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,919
all right so now that i've shown that to

372
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,839
you guys

373
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,919
blood guts and tears is that what it

374
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,279
takes to put these beds together watch

375
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,639
out

376
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,360
actually i know a few friends who have

377
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,440
put in beds together several times

378
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
and uh they had a hell of a time doing

379
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,919
it i'm not saying that this is easy at

380
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,600
all it's not

381
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,600
so

382
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,198
with our organic layer we also want to

383
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,279
add

384
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,480
native soil ooh my piece of wood i'm

385
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,959
going to save this actually i just want

386
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,558
to put it on top like that native soil i

387
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,240
live out here in colorado we have mostly

388
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:26,480
clay soil

389
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,759
soil has sand silt and clay

390
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,360
this

391
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,400
is what your

392
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,959
bed needs for its organic material

393
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,240
having samsung play is extremely

394
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,440
important for redox potential

395
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,120
i'm not really going to get into it

396
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,880
because i don't know

397
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,439
everything about redox potential but

398
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,400
there are a million shows on

399
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,679
fcp that they talk about redox potential

400
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,240
mainly it's the um

401
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,240
cation exchange

402
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,599
right between positive and negative

403
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,440
cations

404
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,199
something happens with stem silt and

405
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,240
clay that helps

406
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,400
um

407
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,440
the redox potential and the cation

408
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,000
extends and it's extremely important

409
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,640
so i'm just spreading that out

410
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,640
i used a five gallon bucket

411
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,919
of native soil now

412
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
all right so

413
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,240
i had put in

414
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,879
a five gallon bucket of of native soil

415
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,319
from my backyard into here what i did

416
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,600
with it to make sure that i wasn't

417
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,720
getting any bugs

418
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,879
is i dug up a lot of my native soil and

419
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,880
i just let it sit out in the big

420
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,799
container so if there was any bugs in

421
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,240
there they could just crawl away

422
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:42,079
um now the next thing that i want to add

423
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:45,599
is a nice big scoop of soil i had gotten

424
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,599
from hiking in the mountains

425
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,320
this one was found near a tree with a

426
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,320
lot a lot of fungi growing from it

427
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:02,319
so that's going to be super awesome

428
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:05,440
another organic material i like to add

429
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,119
sticks from old harvests

430
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,160
i could have cut them up and shredded

431
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,519
them i probably should have

432
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
i don't really have a lot of time for

433
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,359
that right now

434
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,599
so the reason why i'm adding sticks is

435
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,678
because i want to add any kind of woody

436
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,678
material so any kind of woody material

437
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,880
that you can think of that's what fungi

438
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,919
loves to grow off

439
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,679
i'm just going to spread it around

440
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,880
even if you're outside building a soil

441
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,960
bed i did this outside too

442
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,960
i built my soil bed for my outdoors

443
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,279
tomatoes same way

444
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,679
i used a lot of outdoor wood that was

445
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,000
already lying down everywhere i used

446
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,960
some lawn clippings and i use organic

447
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,359
soil mix that with compost and what not

448
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
let's see i have another bag here

449
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,038
this one also has

450
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,640
the leaves from

451
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,640
my um

452
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,960
avocado tree that i have

453
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,679
um when you have dead dying leaves it

454
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,200
still has plenty of

455
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,840
nutrients

456
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,038
inside of it that can be taken up by

457
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:11,279
fungi bacteria microorganisms worms and

458
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,119
stuff like that they love this

459
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,440
um i have a lot of skins from old

460
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,399
avocados i'm sure if you've been

461
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,279
watching

462
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,280
you know all about the avocado

463
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,119
so nothing too perfect i'm just

464
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,120
spreading it out

465
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,360
and

466
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,439
uh

467
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,798
so i got some old bones i really wanted

468
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,360
to make

469
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,918
water soluble calcium and i just never

470
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,839
really got into collecting enough bones

471
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,120
to char them to do that

472
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,199
and these have been sitting out for a

473
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,359
long time i figured i'd just

474
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,679
put them in there any kind of organic

475
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,599
material

476
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,600
except for your avocado seeds otherwise

477
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,759
you'll end up growing a lot of avocado

478
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,000
trees like me

479
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,000
um

480
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,120
but these are old

481
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,839
old rotten avocados these could go right

482
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,719
in there the worms love it the worms

483
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:11,359
eat up the avocado they get together

484
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,360
they start rubbing on each other

485
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,678
and having what some would call

486
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,678
worm sex

487
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:24,240
put in the avocados take out the seeds

488
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,000
avocado tech is typically done on the

489
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,159
soil surface

490
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,159
but

491
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
i'm looking for organic material to put

492
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,360
in this layer so

493
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,359
let me show you what i got so far

494
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,320
so i just kind of spread out the sticks

495
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,158
old leaves

496
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,279
old food

497
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,520
nothing too crazy

498
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,519
now

499
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,960
now i am ready

500
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,440
for

501
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,759
my coupons

502
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,840
you could use anyone's mix that you want

503
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,839
to use

504
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,839
i like coot's mix i i made a big huge

505
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,279
like

506
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,879
60 gallons of it and worked out perfect

507
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,119
when you do it this way and you stick

508
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,640
your plants in you don't even have to

509
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,839
worry about feeding it anything your

510
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,159
first round

511
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,158
you just uh let nature take its course

512
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
i'm sure you guys don't want to see me

513
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,440
sit here shoveling all this in but i am

514
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,879
being very very careful because of the

515
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,200
stitches on my ankle right now

516
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,360
i'm trying to be uh clean just showing

517
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
you

518
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,519
how we're getting this done

519
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,120
i'm going to fill up this bed and show

520
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,839
you what it looks like when i'm finished

521
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,319
hey friends building your own soil

522
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,720
you can make your own mix it's coot's

523
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,720
mix

524
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,840
this part is going to be the total value

525
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,038
of how many gallons you're trying to

526
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,119
achieve

527
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,599
this is a percentage

528
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,199
this part is going to look at your total

529
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,279
cubic feet

530
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
and this is how many cups

531
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,000
per cubic feet

532
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,679
of your

533
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,839
total mix

534
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,600
so

535
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,959
uh where i live we don't really have

536
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,918
access to pumice or scoria so in the

537
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,240
place of that i use rice hulls

538
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,440
and i did get some pumice from bonsai

539
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,558
jack most of this will be rice hull so

540
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,600
i also got peat

541
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,759
i got a bio char i got that from build

542
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,480
the soil i was short so i had to get

543
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:37,919
some more from the grow store

544
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,880
i got worm castings compost

545
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,919
azomite oyster shell

546
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,679
crab meal malted barley

547
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,880
basalt

548
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,880
um gypsum

549
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:55,119
and we're getting it all put together

550
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,519
60 gallons

551
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,519
coots mix super soil

552
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,000
when you're all done mixing it you could

553
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:05,839
put it in a big root barrel

554
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,839
and this is what it should look like

555
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,960
super super blended you can't even tell

556
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,200
the difference of all the ingredients

557
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,240
that were put into here

558
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,240
it's a lot a lot of mixing

559
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,079
there we go

560
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,000
all right now that we got the bed filled

561
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:30,399
with our 60 gallons of coots mix

562
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
we're pretty much done with this part as

563
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,559
you can see i still got plenty of space

564
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,640
from where the top of the soil is to

565
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,278
where my bed is which is fun

566
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,679
because over the years as i'm digging

567
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,679
out a hole and planting in a new plant

568
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
it's going to continuously add more and

569
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,038
more as i top dress with like

570
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,880
mulch from the plants or when i top

571
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,119
dress with things like compost or

572
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,440
whatever it's going to keep adding more

573
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,759
and more layers so this doesn't have to

574
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,679
be completely full to the top right here

575
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:05,200
is good enough for now

576
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,519
um let me just show you

577
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,480
see cook's a lovely mix

578
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:14,200
all in there looking great

579
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,200
nice and smooth

580
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,159
uh what i like to add now

581
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,278
is some compost you can get any compost

582
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,760
that you like

583
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:26,798
uh i found a bag of

584
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,798
this compost

585
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,720
it works out just fine i don't have too

586
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,400
much left in this bag i'm going to use

587
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,880
what i have now

588
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,120
um i might end up going to the store to

589
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,120
get more

590
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,159
so i'll use what i have for now and

591
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:50,960
spread it out i don't need too much

592
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,799
it's just um

593
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,038
going to be available for the plants

594
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,440
when they come in here so that's not

595
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,158
going to be for a few days anyways

596
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,400
this is what i have left of fukashi i'm

597
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:06,720
also going to get more bokashi

598
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,720
i usually would get bokashi either from

599
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,440
growing organic

600
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,440
or from um bokashi earthworks

601
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,639
i'm just gonna sprinkle it like that for

602
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,360
now i'm going to go back and buy more

603
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,799
compost and more book kashi and you

604
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,319
really don't need to add too much

605
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,639
technically you don't need to add any at

606
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,599
all this is just my way of giving this

607
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,799
bed an extra boost for the plants

608
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:42,158
also

609
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,158
we have build the soils cover crop blend

610
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,159
i like this crop blend um not everybody

611
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:53,640
does a cover crop

612
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,640
but on a bed i definitely do not mind it

613
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,880
so i'm just going to sprinkle this cover

614
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,960
crop on top

615
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,559
like that i'm going to get everything

616
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,880
wet

617
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,798
i'm going to come back with

618
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,440
probably just a tad more compost than

619
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:12,480
bokashi not even too much let's see what

620
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,480
it looks like now see

621
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,559
and i kind of want to like

622
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,278
like that

623
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:22,480
sprinkle it around

624
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,480
get it going like this

625
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,240
when you put plants in here you really

626
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,719
don't need to add anything whatsoever

627
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,919
you could just water and go

628
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,679
um

629
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,480
let's see

630
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,000
yeah

631
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,319
looks like we're about done i'm just

632
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,319
gonna get my uh watering wand

633
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,839
i'm just gonna get my watering wand and

634
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
get this nice and wet

635
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,840
so when i put a bed together like this

636
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,679
[Music]

637
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,798
adding as much

638
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,880
amendments as i added with coot's mix

639
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,879
you might want to let it sit for a few

640
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,278
days to cook

641
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,278
basically what they mean by that is it

642
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,440
takes some time for all these amendments

643
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,359
to get together and

644
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,360
coagulate and all that stuff it could be

645
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,599
a little bit too hot right now to put

646
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,000
plants in so you just want to give it

647
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,519
some time to work itself

648
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,319
together

649
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:29,278
um it don't take too long

650
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,359
i know sub cool has a super soil recipe

651
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,679
that he recommends that it be cooked for

652
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,278
about 30 days

653
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,519
some people when you're looking at their

654
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,240
recipes that give you a recommendation

655
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,558
on how long to let it cook for they mean

656
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,399
how long to let it sit all collectively

657
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,879
together

658
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,959
anyone can make their own medicine

659
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,520
you can make it in your backyard

660
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,919
you can make it in your house

661
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,519
just keep in mind that if you make it in

662
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,360
your house

663
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,558
you're going to want a frame to put it

664
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,678
on and

665
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,359
you're going to want to tape up the

666
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,480
corners don't cut yourself like i did

667
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,199
um

668
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,599
i

669
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,519
have found it pretty easy

670
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,158
doing pots

671
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:15,038
growing with pots all my life to

672
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,278
understand how to water pots

673
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,038
by weighing it you cannot pick up a bed

674
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,359
and weigh it so

675
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,960
the only way to really tell if your bed

676
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,199
needs water

677
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,200
i usually look at the plants the plant

678
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,880
leaves it starts going down like okay it

679
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,240
needs a little water

680
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,840
sometimes i'll just stick my finger

681
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,359
right in there

682
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:37,678
if i stick my finger in there and it's

683
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,678
way too dry then i'm gonna water it

684
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,519
nothing too much i give a little bit of

685
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,879
water probably let it sit for about five

686
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,398
minutes come back and give it a little

687
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,240
bit more water because it just kind of

688
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:52,719
takes time for all the water to go down

689
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,919
so that's about it for now i'm gonna let

690
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,440
this sit for about a week or two and

691
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,600
give it some time to cook and uh then

692
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,640
i'll be ready to put my plants in

693
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:07,199
uh now make sure when you have your room

694
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,679
set up for your bed you're gonna want to

695
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,720
set your lights at like a veg cycle at

696
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,120
first while your plants are growing tall

697
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,640
until they get about i would say up to

698
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,398
here

699
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,200
and once they're about this tall then

700
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,278
you'll want to switch your light cycle

701
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,240
from

702
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:29,759
one of most people have it at 16

703
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,720
16 hours on or 18 hours on

704
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,278
no

705
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,079
i usually you do my light cycle and veg

706
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,519
it's like 20 hours of light four hours

707
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,439
of darkness

708
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,038
but uh and you don't have to do it that

709
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,640
way some people do it differently when

710
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,879
you're going to flower you've got to do

711
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,720
12 12 which means 12 hours of light 12

712
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,240
hours of darkness so you put your plants

713
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,558
in you let them grow until they're about

714
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,399
this tall and then you switch your light

715
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,558
cycle you do that just on the timer it's

716
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,319
so easy you don't have to pick up this

717
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,079
huge plant and then move it to another

718
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,439
room which is what i've been doing for

719
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,678
years so

720
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,399
this makes it a lot easier

721
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,880
i really like the bed it makes it makes

722
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,959
my life so much easier doing it this way

723
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,000
um i'm going to get some lights in here

724
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,240
to go over the bed um

725
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,679
you could also do autos autos are great

726
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,319
you don't got to worry about a photo

727
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,080
period with autos you got this huge bed

728
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,918
they got plenty of room for their roots

729
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,119
to spread if you get hooked up with a

730
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,759
really great

731
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,719
uh auto breeder then you'll have some

732
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,079
really amazing auto plants so we'll see

733
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,200
how that goes

734
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,879
um

735
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,120
let me show you guys

736
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,440
it's just nice and wet

737
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,000
i'm just letting the water uh take some

738
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,080
time to sink down so that's all just

739
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,398
wanted to show you guys that

740
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,398
um

741
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,960
oh yeah if you want to see my stitches

742
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,879
stick around i'll take you

743
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,278
into a different room not in this room

744
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,640
and open up my bandage and show you my

745
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,359
cool scars

746
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,240
take care everybody peace out

747
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,278
all right now that we're all cleaned up

748
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,079
um

749
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:06,000
if you guys are anything like me and you

750
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,119
don't like looking at

751
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,640
cuts scars anything inside the skin or

752
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,038
stitches

753
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,200
now is a really good time to click that

754
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:18,079
like button and go ahead and shut off

755
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,480
this video but if you're a weirdo who

756
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,639
likes to look at scars and stitches

757
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,480
i'm going to show you the cut that i got

758
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,640
earlier that got me going to the

759
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,240
hospital for stitches so let's take a

760
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,000
look

761
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,798
oh this is so gross i haven't even

762
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,038
opened it up yet so this is my first

763
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,278
time

764
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,278
oh

765
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,678
ew

766
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,678
you see that

767
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,798
safety first ladies and gentlemen

768
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,399
make sure that you're cutting those

769
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,558
corners and putting your duct tape on

770
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,439
them you do not want to slice your foot

771
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:56,000
off of the metal from that material

772
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,000
trying to put a bed together the things

773
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,319
that i do for fcp

774
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,319
never cease to amaze me i just wanted to

775
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:05,200
give you a little update on the bed so

776
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,079
far i did put some lights over it and

777
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,919
since

778
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,759
i only need a light on for the little

779
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,640
seedlings i decided to go with just my

780
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,079
315 lec for now

781
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,720
i'm giving it just a little bit of

782
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:19,159
microbial tea nothing too much i just

783
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,319
wanted to keep it a little moist

784
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,960
[Music]

785
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,879
as i go through harvest i'm gonna chop

786
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,399
up the stems and whatnot try to create a

787
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,000
nice mulch layer

788
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,000
some of the seedlings are starting to

789
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,679
grow

790
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,919
there are also some areas where i had

791
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,240
put the bokashi that had started to

792
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,399
create some fungi which is really nice

793
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,319
when i get more bokashi in i'm gonna

794
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,158
sprinkle it on top with a little bit of

795
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,398
compost and then i'm gonna put the mulch

796
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,640
layer over that and then we'll update

797
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,719
you guys when we're ready to transplant

798
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,120
some plants in here

799
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,919
hey everybody we're back it's been two

800
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,158
weeks since we've uh put this bed in and

801
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,360
so now we got a little bit of cover crop

802
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,679
growing

803
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,759
we've got a nice mycelium connection

804
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,559
already happening i went ahead and

805
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,319
transplanted a few plants

806
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,398
if you're lucky you live in a state like

807
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,000
colorado then everybody gets to at least

808
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,319
have six plants

809
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,918
uh or i've heard people out in canada at

810
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,519
least get to have four

811
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,759
however many plants you want to put in

812
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,559
your bed is totally up to you

813
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,560
more plants doesn't necessarily mean

814
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,799
more yields because you can train them

815
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,639
if you wanted to so anyways i'm just

816
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,919
showing this with the six plants in the

817
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,480
bed

818
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,480
so first what i want to do is

819
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,639
get a nice little shovel

820
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,398
to uh move it apart just a little bit

821
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,000
i kind of like saving the little woods

822
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,799
that i call it

823
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,480
but i'm made mainly uh just building a

824
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,480
small enough hole to put that in

825
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,799
try not to disturb it too much because

826
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,119
the uh mycelium in here is really

827
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,960
looking nice

828
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,280
um one thing i like to sprinkle down

829
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,480
this is azos

830
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,400
it's a beneficial bacteria

831
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,838
i sprinkle this in the bottom of the pot

832
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,240
one spoonful for a plant

833
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,920
take the tan glass

834
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,279
you take your pot you squeeze it at the

835
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,680
bottom

836
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,240
and it should pop out easily

837
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,078
i put um perlite at the bottom of all my

838
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,759
pots so when i put a transplant then

839
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,440
it's easy to loosen it up and get the

840
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,200
roots

841
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,079
right there to make contact with the

842
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:31,598
azos or any other beneficial bacteria

843
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,280
that you may find at your local store

844
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,480
push it all back into place make sure

845
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,839
that my plant is sticking straight up

846
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,000
and if i

847
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,599
move the lid ceiling

848
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,679
just to kind of give you an idea of how

849
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,720
it's all stuck together

850
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,639
i like to put it right back on top

851
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,879
just to kind of put nature back in place

852
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,759
right now dude

853
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,920
all right that's looking good

854
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,599
don't forget to put your tack to your

855
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,440
plank in case if you have a few

856
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,440
different strings in the same bed

857
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,519
i like to hook this somewhere where it's

858
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,519
not going to get wet when i water it

859
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,799
so now that that's all done some of my

860
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,519
last steps

861
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,560
are to top dress just a little bit with

862
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,559
some bokashi

863
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,000
just a little all over the bed because

864
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,039
this is definitely what helps get that

865
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,039
my ceiling going

866
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,358
differently

867
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,358
i also like to top dress with some

868
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:38,358
compost

869
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,960
this is a malibu's

870
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,639
um

871
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,838
uh biodynamic compost mixed with

872
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,920
fruits organic baked grounds compost

873
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,078
and the final thing that i like to do

874
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,519
with my new transplants and a nice new

875
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,320
bed

876
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:03,440
i don't need to um amend this i would

877
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,838
amend this if it was um used but since

878
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,000
this is my first round no i'm ending

879
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,000
just um composting compost tea

880
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,079
another thing that i love about having

881
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,760
these plants um in the beds is as i'm

882
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,800
giving a nice soil trench i can also

883
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,359
give it a foliar spray

884
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,119
that way this nice microbials and this

885
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,880
gene knot are not only are going in

886
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,119
their soil but they're also going on the

887
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,119
leaves

888
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,359
there's more than one way for our plants

889
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,720
to get taken through one way through

890
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,639
roots

891
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,639
and the other way is on the leaves

892
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,039
that's all

893
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,160
i would say i probably lightly mist this

894
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,839
like this every other day

895
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,519
just a little bit of water i don't give

896
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:55,039
it too much

897
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,880
i would say this is probably one gallon

898
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,440
we think about how much soil is in here

899
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,280
one gallon isn't a lot and i definitely

900
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,679
go really really slow with the water

901
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,680
just like this

902
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,920
while i was transplanting i noticed

903
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,920
this one was a little bit more moist

904
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,280
than this like this so i'm just going to

905
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,280
keep that in mind when i water

906
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,560
try to focus on this i get just a bit

907
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:20,559
more attention

908
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,960
that's it

909
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,358
