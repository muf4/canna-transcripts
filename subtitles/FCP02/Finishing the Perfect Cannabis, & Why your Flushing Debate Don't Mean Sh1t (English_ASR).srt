79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,400
really i i'm not a huge fan of flushing

80
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,799
i think a it's it's a misinterpreted

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
word um oftentimes uh people

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,599
misinterpret it with leaching so just

83
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,359
out of um ease and

84
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,518
communication and understanding we're

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,080
gonna we're gonna go by like the jorge

86
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,799
cervantes kind of the the classical tech

87
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,799
textbooks on cannabis that's and and

88
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,719
horticulture that lean towards leaching

89
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,959
is adding a surplus of water to your

90
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,000
medium to remove

91
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,918
excess nutrients or imbalances to rinse

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,238
your medium of

93
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,680
certain improp problems or issues this

94
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,959
is leaking

95
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,120
flushing is commonly dictated as at the

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,719
end of flower when you feed nothing but

97
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,399
water to starve the nutrients to starve

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
the plant and cause

99
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,638
chlorosis in which that the plant uses

100
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,079
the leaf to fuel everything else but

101
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,840

00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,599
different mediums and grey methods and

339
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,639
really depending on this could dictate

340
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,600
how you personally finish your plant so

341
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,360
let's talk about the last three weeks of

342
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,199
flowering what's actually going on there

343
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,159
and what we what we do ourselves to

344
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,958
create the best and opportune best

345
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,958
opportunity situation for our cannabis

346
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,439
flower to produce the highest

347
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:04,000
cannabinoids the highest terpene profile

348
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,600
everything that we feel is makes best

349
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,198
and i think there is other than the fact

350
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
that there's little there's definitely

351
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,879
some science out there that we we should

352
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,078
all have a read and have a look at but

353
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,919
there is

354
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,399
a certain thing to be said to each and

355
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,799
every individual cannabis is about

356
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,559
growing and enjoying growing the plant

357
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,359
and being part of the community of

358
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:26,719
growing the plant it is not

359
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,959
if it brings you joy to do something

360
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,480
go ahead you know if it makes you happy

361
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,638
go ahead and do it the world is your

362
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,879
oyster go ahead and experiment these are

363
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,759
our opinions on how we do things and our

364
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,519
methodologies uh and we are all very

365
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,198
open-minded individuals we certainly

366
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,639
critically have no others

367
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,559
i look forward to hearing everybody's

368
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,159
responses and how they go about here so

369
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,078
i am going to jump around a little bit

370
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,919
i'm not going to go straight to manny as

371
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,559
he would probably

372
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,639
expect i'm going to start with

373
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:00,159
a really kind of

374
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,440
open-ended question towards josh like

375
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:07,039
when it comes to finnish cannabis

376
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,519
what do you think really defines great

377
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,639
cannabis like what what what is

378
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,839
perfectly

379
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,839
finished cannabis to you

380
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,039
maybe i uh you know what josh this kid

381
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,559
i'm gonna i threw it really

382
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,240
are you available

383
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,559
yeah no i just had to kind of pull away

384
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,600
for from the other room there um but

385
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,159
yeah so

386
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,959
great uh cannabis to me

387
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,519
uh would be you know something that

388
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:38,559
like generally for myself anyway i've

389
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,639
cured things for a minimum of two weeks

390
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,679
depending on the cultivar sometimes

391
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,519
uh much much longer um

392
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,239
but yeah so i mean when you're you know

393
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,600
having that kind of a a

394
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,198
product

395
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,560
you know it's been hang dried it's been

396
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,679
hand trimmed

397
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:59,198
uh when you smoke it it's you know

398
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:01,519
it's very smooth um you know

399
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,120
generally white ash is a good thing

400
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,799
although it's

401
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,720
not always indicative of a quality

402
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,399
product

403
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,920
but uh yeah generally speaking you're

404
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,399
gonna have you know a

405
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,559
very nice

406
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,839
pure like a consistent color dash at the

407
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,719
very least um and not consistently black

408
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,440
um which anyone here can attest will

409
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,879
taste horrible um but yeah and then

410
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,880
depending on you know the quality of our

411
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,320
inequality and you know the thc level of

412
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,919
that strain and the terpene level that

413
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,120
strain you'll get you know a really nice

414
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,759
grease ring

415
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,600
on like a joint for example but um again

416
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,919
that

417
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,560
isn't always necessarily you know a

418
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,078
marker of quality of how to do quality

419
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,479
you know joints that didn't get that

420
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,638
grease ring but you know those were you

421
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,240
know the you know the levels of your

422
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,240
team had been lower but you know the

423
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,799
terpenes were still there you still got

424
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,399
an amazing effect from it

425
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,599
but those are all just little things

426
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,440
that i kind of

427
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,440
look for in a clean product

428
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,318
awesome so we know we all know we're

429
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,959
looking for this beautiful nice clean

430
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,480
smoked smoking product and we see the

431
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,759
whiter ash

432
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,160
oil ring

433
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,519
or for very very sticky residents

434
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
products these are things that we look

435
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,599
for for a great finished product so jazz

436
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,280
what do you do on the tail and the

437
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,000
flower for your plants i mean you're

438
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,160
doing a lot of extraction specifically

439
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,679
solvent less extraction um does that

440
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,440
have any

441
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,519
variance in how you finish your plants

442
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,200
or what exactly is your methodology

443
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,599
about that

444
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,400
i mean i grew in beds

445
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,759
you know inside right now so

446
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,080
i can't really

447
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,519
flush my beds in a

448
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,519
in a

449
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,400
in a way

450
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,519
so

451
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,480
i

452
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,440
never flush essentially i just lay off

453
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,440
putting

454
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,038
any inputs any top dressings or anything

455
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,038
onto my soil

456
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,038
um

457
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,719
like half of the half of the

458
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
plant's life usually like four

459
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,960
weeks

460
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,000
at week four or five i'll stop putting

461
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,038
anything on my soil so that

462
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,798
what is there can get broken down but

463
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:19,679
the biggest thing that i've noticed in

464
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,918
growing

465
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,120
organically is that

466
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,280
you can

467
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,599
screw up your

468
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,960
your beds and your

469
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:33,509
finished product by over applying

470
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,200
too much compost

471
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:38,000
[Music]

472
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,240
worm castings or whatever

473
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,240
you will get a black ash from doing that

474
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,319
your plant will

475
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,200
uh cannabis is a bioaccumulator so

476
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,439
uh

477
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,640
it will just pick up everything out of

478
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,519
your soil

479
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,440
um

480
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,679
good and bad and sometimes it doesn't

481
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,720
need all of those extra inputs um

482
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,720
so my whole approach to

483
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,000
to it all is just keeping it as simple

484
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,880
as possible

485
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,279
and

486
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,120
not adding anything basically

487
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,359
past the halfway point of the plant's

488
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,359
life

489
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,240
awesome and you're you're in you're in

490
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,798
large

491
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,720
bed style organic right

492
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,480
yeah uh in

493
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,679
in four by four beds

494
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,319
um

495
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,240
you know so all i do is just top dress

496
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,038
and that that is it

497
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,798
um and i do some supplemental feedings

498
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,640
when the plants show

499
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,839
that they're starting to

500
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,840
maybe need some more food

501
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,960
but i just try to keep it as simple as

502
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,798
possible and

503
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,720
you know if you get out of the way with

504
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,720
cannabis and just sort of get the

505
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,240
environmentals right you don't need to

506
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,000
at least the way that i grow you don't

507
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,159
need to add a lot more to it um you know

508
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,359
i have all my nutrients pre-mixed in my

509
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,480
soil so

510
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,479
um

511
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,400
you know that that's where

512
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,519
it gets all the goods from

513
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,120
um

514
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,558
and

515
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,158
yeah i mean i

516
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,599
i

517
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,720
i just try to

518
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:21,839
get out the way and let the and create

519
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,319
is least stressful an environment um for

520
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,158
my plants and if you're not giving your

521
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,359
plants enough food

522
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,200
they'll show it

523
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,399
they're all there also will show in

524
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,440
different ways if you're giving your

525
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,440
plants too much food

526
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,558
i think people oftentimes with cannabis

527
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,678
uh

528
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,158
have uh

529
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,640
an approach of being a [ __ ]

530
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,679
where they think just putting more on

531
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,679
your plants and more on your um you know

532
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,919
more water and more

533
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,840
more nutrients that you're going to get

534
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,080
a better product when

535
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,119
truly you don't need that as much like

536
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,439
even the recommended dosages on

537
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:05,038
fertilizers or you know if you are going

538
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,558
to use a fertilizer um

539
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,038
start off at half

540
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,158
of what the recommended dosages and see

541
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,480
what happens

542
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,360
you know one could be huge cost savings

543
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,599
and two

544
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,599
um

545
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,400
you know you could be way you could be

546
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,640
wasting your time and money down the

547
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,519
drain with uh uh

548
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,520
with

549
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,918
over applying fertilizers and that's one

550
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,079
just thing that i see overall and that

551
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,720
will end up if you over fertilize your

552
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:36,558
plants that's where you get the

553
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,120
black ash from and there's no way of

554
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,759
flushing that out

555
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,519
of your plants like it's in your leaves

556
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,879
in the in the plant

557
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,798
material

558
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,919
doing solvent extraction i get a little

559
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:48,639
bit of a

560
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,679
uh

561
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,440
you know

562
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,840
we don't see that

563
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,120
as much in our end product because all

564
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:59,199
we're doing is

565
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:01,439
extracting the the glandular heads

566
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,798
and not don't have anything to do with

567
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,080
the leaf so

568
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,359
um

569
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,678
but

570
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,599
your plant will be much happier if you

571
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,120
don't try to force feed it and shove

572
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,959
everything down

573
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,038
it's just finding that happy balance and

574
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,919
once you do it enough you start to see

575
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:17,919
little nuances

576
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,720
oh it's a very organic methodology about

577
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,558
it now i'm going to kind of jump over

578
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,558
and just because i really i think this

579
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,399
is an excellent point of movement here

580
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,119
to really highlight the differences of

581
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,759
opinions on experts because chaz and

582
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,519
manny are probably two of the

583
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,319
i'm going to say the most experienced

584
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,279
here

585
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,599
um

586
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,200
and and they have very different

587
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,678
opinions on so i'm going to ask manny

588
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,600
how do you finish the tail end of your

589
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,000
plant or we're going to see here because

590
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,839
i don't really know um that the last

591
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,759
three to four weeks of your plants

592
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:56,079
flower cycle how do you like to finish

593
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:59,839
your plants because i know you're a big

594
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:01,199
advocate against the flushing debate

595
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,599
but i would love to know a little bit

596
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,960
more detail on your your thought process

597
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,959
and methodology about it

598
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,558
thanks london

599
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,679
so

600
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,079
kind of

601
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,798
start from the beginning

602
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,918
there's a misconception with

603
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:24,079
flushing and what it actually does and

604
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,400
you did cover the terminology and and

605
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,000
how people have got it wrong

606
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,919
but i think that

607
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,159
there's a little more to it that people

608
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,240
don't understand and that is i think a

609
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,400
lot of people have been taught

610
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,000
that the last week or the last two weeks

611
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,280
that you feed your flower nothing but

612
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,919
straight water

613
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:44,879
that miraculously everything that's

614
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,480
accumulated over its uh flowering cycle

615
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,120
and life cycle

616
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,360
that um

617
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,759
anything bad or bad tasting is somehow

618
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,158
miraculously going to be washed away

619
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:59,200
and you know that's

620
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,600
not true at all science shows us that

621
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,519
it's not true and if you understand the

622
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,839
biology of the plant you'll understand

623
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:09,200
that as has been said by a few people

624
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,879
that it is a bio accumulator

625
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,519
that being said

626
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,159
i do think that you're

627
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,158
we're on to a good point from what jazz

628
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,440
stated about people over feeding their

629
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,919
plants and that is that

630
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,400
there are different levels for different

631
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,360
strains that will take different amounts

632
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,120
of

633
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,119
feed opposed to others

634
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,798
that feed needs to be tailored off at

635
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,360
some point in that cycle

636
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:42,158
because that flower's not going to need

637
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,319
that high of concentration when the

638
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,880
flower first starts out

639
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,839
you know once you flip and and you start

640
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,559
to see bud sites if you're into let's

641
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:56,079
say week four

642
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:58,798
that uh feed regiment what i do is i

643
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:01,519
start tapering it off so i will run my

644
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,839
feed regiment to a maximum

645
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:07,839
as what the plant will take that will go

646
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:09,918
anywhere from 15 to 1800 ppm

647
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,079
but then i also

648
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,880
will use teas

649
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:17,439
in order to raise my ppm

650
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,360
at the same time uh for the longest

651
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,519
period that i'm going to be at the peak

652
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:26,240
to around 2800 to 3200 ppm

653
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,960
by using the tees now this doesn't

654
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,919
affect or adversely affect the flower in

655
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,720
any way

656
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,240
and helps build a very good strong bud

657
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,360
and strong structure

658
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,359
i will

659
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,678
then start to taper off so that by the

660
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:44,158
time i'm on my last week of

661
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:47,840
feed i'm down to 100 150 ppm

662
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,080
and um you know i'll uh i'll finish my

663
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,599
flower that way i don't use any type of

664
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,678
finishing agent

665
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,439
i don't i don't believe in him

666
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,159
i don't

667
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,480
i don't see any any need

668
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,860
to feed straight water

669
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,960
if you've

670
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:05,359
[Music]

671
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,159
fed your plant your plants properly and

672
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,000
have it here to a schedule where you you

673
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,480
take them to the max and then you know

674
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,798
slowly reduce it back down to as low as

675
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,120
possible so that's how i finish it's

676
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,599
kind of similar to chas in many ways and

677
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,399
we do agree on on many many things

678
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,558
but

679
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,240
you know that's that's always been

680
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,240
my go-to and i'm done speaking

681
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,000
it's awesome i think there's a really

682
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,519
interesting aspect and

683
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,919
point that i'm really seeing here is

684
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,839
that nitrogen toxicity in the fiery

685
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,799
stage mid

686
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,720
early

687
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,158
and the later in the flowering stage the

688
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,319
worst is the worst the plant will suffer

689
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:48,320
in in this in this

690
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:51,439
bad flavor or issues um in the plant so

691
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:54,558
avoiding this high nitrogen toxicity um

692
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,679
it is is probably people were over

693
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,519
compensating um by trying to flush it

694
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,480
out by trying to do a derivative now

695
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,679
when you have something like an

696
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,319
ammonical

697
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,278
ammonium based nitrogen like nitrogen

698
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:10,480
sulfate um the plant takes these in as a

699
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:13,759
salt a lot harder it's actually forced

700
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,000
fed uh ammonium sulfate if i could

701
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,839
i know i'm correct is the plant takes it

702
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,119
in through the water no matter what and

703
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,959
that's how you get these really high

704
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,719
nitrogen base burning and that's when

705
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,679
you get this terrible flavor so i wonder

706
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,159
if this kind of common over time and

707
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,000
misconception was a way to counteract

708
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,799
this balance here and that's why this

709
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,319
whole flushing concept came out jameson

710
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,639
i would love to hear a little bit about

711
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,278
how you think about i mean your flowers

712
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,038
are

713
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,519
fantastic if you all have a chance to go

714
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,359
check out damien's instagram plate have

715
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,440
a click on there because it is quite

716
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,319
impressive um there are some beautiful

717
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,038
flowers to check out what do you use or

718
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:53,359
do at the end or in general

719
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,038
what's your kind of mentality

720
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,879
and theorem when it comes to finishing

721
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,879
the finest flower that you can

722
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,399
so

723
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,480
my school of thought you know i follow

724
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,158
in the footsteps of guys who you know

725
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,679
know more than me and you know that you

726
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,399
know chaz has been cultivating in

727
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,640
organics long long before i had him so

728
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,879
you know i i align completely with

729
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,520
everything he says um

730
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,840
you know at the end of my

731
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,879
cycle i'll top dress with like

732
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,798
leonardite or like a fulvic acid

733
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,600
and i'll water that in

734
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,960
um to like help chelate

735
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,519
some

736
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,440
potential heavy metals out of my plants

737
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,200
and i've had

738
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,200
uh

739
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,038
like i'm not testing so i i can't really

740
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,399
i'm not testing a control so i couldn't

741
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,720
really say it's making a difference

742
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:48,079
there but what i can say is like

743
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,038
um as far as like my curing goes and my

744
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:54,240
white ash like i'm able to achieve

745
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:56,879
a white ash faster

746
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,839
uh when i use a fulvic

747
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,039
at the end of my flower versus

748
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,918
uh

749
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,398
like

750
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,399
not using that same problem

751
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,239
so i mean i think that

752
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,239
you know very similar to what chad said

753
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,319
in the very same vein i mean i remember

754
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,319
when i started growing i was you know

755
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,359
full advanced nutrients i was running

756
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,038
the full program with the boosters and

757
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,798
you know my

758
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,119
you know my thoughts were you know the

759
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,558
more money i could put into my reservoir

760
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,719
the more money i was going to get out of

761
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,319
that room and you know it took me many

762
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,399
years to kind of figure

763
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,480
out that wasn't true and you know i

764
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,079
flushed then and

765
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,519
you know like i you know i didn't really

766
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,960
have controls back in the day but i can

767
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,038
tell you that i was feeding so heavy

768
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,399
that you know i i did have nitrogen

769
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,278
toxicity and

770
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,879
it probably was a bit necessary but

771
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,159
um you know

772
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,760
it's

773
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,200
it's a bit of you know how i look at

774
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,200
this is a bit of different strokes for

775
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,480
different folks but like i completely

776
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,480
you know i have a tremendous amount of

777
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,319
respect for manny and i know you know

778
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,440
how much time he's put into this craft

779
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,480
and

780
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,278
so you know i i i believe he's got a lot

781
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,759
of great points there too but as a as a

782
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,599
living soil grower like you know just

783
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,798
top dressing some some amendments

784
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,558
that'll help

785
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,158
you know

786
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,240
bring things out of the plant is about

787
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,600
all that i do

788
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,599
towards the end of my cycle

789
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,319
i think there's a huge variation between

790
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,079
when you look at kind of when growing in

791
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,480
like a four by four bed and then when

792
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:30,558
you're going in a three gallon pot um

793
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,240
and that that what how you want to

794
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:33,119
finish that plant especially when you're

795
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,038
doing

796
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,918
these type of systems i mean i'd love to

797
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:39,599
jump over and and

798
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,640
have a talk

799
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,158
with anita about how she finishes how

800
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,200
she likes to finish off her plant and

801
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,120
kind of

802
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,440
her opinions on what consumers find

803
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:53,199
to be a high quality

804
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,960
flower and what their opinions are on

805
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,159
kind of is this a is this white ash

806
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,880
thing uh a little bit more of a

807
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,559
of a head of a classical grower type of

808
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,480
stuff or is it something you hear on the

809
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,720
streets on a regular basis i'd love to

810
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,720
hear it

811
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,759
for sure um thanks for

812
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,278
watching

813
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:18,720
um i um personally i'm actually similar

814
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:22,240
with like in the way that i do

815
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:26,240
like organic like gardening and so i

816
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,240
don't brush at all um i just

817
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,519
mix the soil at the beginning i'm using

818
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,159
organic

819
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,200
as much as i can like my own compost and

820
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
i have a

821
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,240
worm uh farm that

822
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,398
i started yeah i gotta work from my

823
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,759
backyard um and

824
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,879
it's uh

825
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,879
it's

826
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,880
really for me it's just a lot easier

827
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:04,158
so you know and i noticed that some

828
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,759
sides you know get a little bit

829
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,120
um

830
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,119
they start getting a little bit more

831
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,439
like you know meeting more nutrients or

832
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,879
whatnot and then i'll i'll uh add

833
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,798
amendment as i go during flower but um

834
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,720
yeah usually i just kind of let it go

835
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:22,398
and and just keep an eye on it the first

836
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,399
year i i drew though um

837
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,640
and it all

838
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,640
happened and like

839
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,278
heartbreaking but huge lessons that were

840
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,759
learned that year um but yeah for under

841
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,000
the consumer side yeah white ash that

842
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,960
kind of idea definitely you know

843
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,480
thinking that i hear um from people that

844
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,000
are teasing um consumers that have been

845
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,120
part of the

846
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,919
community for some time um so yeah they

847
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,038
look for the white ash and

848
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,000
the rings

849
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,398
um

850
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,679
on the joints or whatnot but i think

851
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,239
that

852
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,759
most consumers that especially new ones

853
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,640
or ones that

854
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,558
don't

855
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,600
even know there are different screens

856
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:08,839
really like

857
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,079
they

858
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:14,240
think beyond it but those kind of type

859
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,759
of people i think they do appreciate it

860
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,359
like a good finish because they don't

861
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,158
understand what it is that they're

862
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,398
appreciating um they like the smoothness

863
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,720
of it and it's not hard or

864
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,278
um those kind of things those are the

865
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,000
descriptors that they would use um from

866
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:29,440
like

867
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,640
somebody that's

868
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,200
a layman i guess um but yeah definitely

869
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,159
it does matter um

870
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,640
i've

871
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,960
seen products out there that doesn't

872
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,919
burn very well it looks nice looks great

873
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,640
uh it doesn't burn well uh it looks

874
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,240
kind of nasty when it's burning and um

875
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,159
it doesn't taste good

876
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,319
so it goes from something that could

877
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,840
have been potentially beautiful um

878
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,079
because you know the trichomes are all

879
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,158
there and everything but

880
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,079
for some reason it wasn't finished

881
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,960
properly or it was

882
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,038
too late or and you know it oxidizes in

883
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,798
the jar or it's been sitting there for a

884
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,480
while that's a huge problem in our

885
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,280
industry right now um the amount of time

886
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,280
that

887
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,800
product is getting

888
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,760
so you can have a perfect finish um have

889
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,320
it in a perfect type of a container so

890
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,000
to protect the integrity of the bud um

891
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,800
and then it sits there

892
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,719
for a while and it continues to oxidize

893
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,800
in the jar um so your perfect bud now is

894
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,719
not so perfect and so there's a lot of

895
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,200
challenges there um i don't have any

896
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,158
answers for those um other than you know

897
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,638
we need to start speaking cannabis um as

898
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,159
a fair triple product instead of a dance

899
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,480
product like how we are um i have been

900
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,639
this week i've been going around um

901
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,159
trying to find an old product for the

902
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,358
companies i work with

903
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,760
um and buying them um because

904
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,559
i don't i don't want stuff out there um

905
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,359
that

906
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:04,400
you know a year old that that's saying

907
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:06,960
to me but there's no there's no

908
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,680
you know anyway that's another topic all

909
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,838
together but um for finishing yeah it

910
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,519
does matter to people but some people

911
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,000
know why it matters some people just

912
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,559
like the final product it's like you

913
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,639
know fine wine or whatnot you can have a

914
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,400
cheap bottle of wine that tastes great

915
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,400
and everything like that um you have an

916
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,160
expensive one that doesn't

917
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,000
doesn't actually taste that great and

918
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,879
but they don't really know what's going

919
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,159
on or why um but yeah i think that it

920
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,640
sells faster you get a better um return

921
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,679
customer when there's a good thing

922
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,799
and that

923
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,719
you turn customers on a regular basis

924
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,960
what you want you don't want somebody

925
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,239
just try at once you're like well that

926
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,559
was fun

927
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,559
anyway

928
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,759
awesome that was an amazing way to

929
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,000
respond that question i really

930
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,920
appreciate that anita i wanted to before

931
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,480
we get too far away from where because

932
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,720
we were talking about leonardi and and

933
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,599
humic there for a little bit

934
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,679
and i know at the end of flower

935
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,400
and in a lot of systems a lot of the

936
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,639
nutrients that are there and available

937
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,639
aren't chelated and they're not quite as

938
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,879
as bioavailable to the plant at all

939
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,799
points in time so i'd love to give the

940
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,240
opportunity over to leah to talk a

941
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,720
little bit about what like humic and

942
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:25,679
phobic can do at the end of flower like

943
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:28,000
jameson was speaking about using um to

944
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,559
to what what exactly it would do there

945
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,239
in the process or how how it might help

946
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,480
the plant at the end of the flowering

947
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:34,479
cycle

948
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,039
thanks london

949
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,200
um

950
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:43,279
well i think understanding what huma can

951
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:45,279
falvik are and i appreciate that jamison

952
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,640
noted that he was using letter diet

953
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,800
because there's different sources that

954
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,679
you can extract humic and fulvic acids

955
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,079
from

956
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,799
these are natural organic acids that can

957
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,680
be

958
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,920
extracted naturally from these highly

959
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,838
decomposed layers of earth

960
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,240
and the sort of the far-reaching

961
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:05,199
decomposed layered before it turns into

962
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:08,239
a hardened coal like what you would burn

963
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:11,279
is leonardite and date is very soft and

964
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,919
crumbly and you can extract uh humic and

965
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,160
fulvic acids which are organic compounds

966
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,240
out of that decomposing matter

967
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,480
the benefits of human can fulvic really

968
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:24,078
well let's first start with fulvic acid

969
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,320
is actually a part of the humic acid

970
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,079
molecule when it's extracted differently

971
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,359
using a different extracting method it

972
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,960
can be extracted extracted separately um

973
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:35,039
humic acid typically is going to be

974
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,760
negatively charged much like your

975
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,599
growing medium and if you're in

976
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,359
a hydroponic system

977
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,160
whether or not you're using soil inert

978
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,920
media or living soil the concept is

979
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,118
still the same

980
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,440
if your root zone is going to be

981
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,160
negative is typically negatively charged

982
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,760
and it draws in positively charged ions

983
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,358
or your nutrients

984
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,200
fulvic acid on the other hand is

985
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,119
positively charged but interestingly

986
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,598
it's high in oxygen so it actually

987
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,440
chelates nutrients extremely well and

988
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,880
because it's such a small molecule it

989
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,559
can actually trans transfer through

990
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,800
cell walls so that means that it can

991
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,358
actually drive up with that nutrient as

992
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,280
a transporter basically it's like wheels

993
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,880
on your on your nutrients and there's

994
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,720
lots of nutrients that are immobile

995
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,160
meaning the plant can't move them around

996
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,838
once it's taken them off they kind of

997
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,759
get stuck in the plant that's where

998
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,838
sometimes you find nutrient deficiencies

999
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,839
in your fan leaves but your new growth

1000
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,358
looks great or your new growth is

1001
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,519
looking deficient but your fan leaves

1002
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:33,920
look great well it's usually indicative

1003
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,599
of a certain type of nutrient immobile

1004
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,440
nutrients that are

1005
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,480
becoming deficient

1006
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,480
so fulvic acid in particular is a really

1007
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,599
interesting component to nutrient

1008
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,599
programs

1009
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,079
for the main reason that it is oxygen

1010
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,599
rich it does chelate to lots of

1011
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,920
different types of nutrients both

1012
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,320
positively and negatively charged

1013
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,240
and and it helps to mobilize those

1014
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,400
nutrients throughout the plant so from

1015
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,838
the soil for whatever your nutrient

1016
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,760
programming is whether you're using

1017
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,599
compost teas if you're using synthetics

1018
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,040
and salts or you're using a combination

1019
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,760
which a lot of growers are getting into

1020
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,679
more hybrid type situations

1021
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,320
folic acid in particular will actually

1022
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:14,159
help the plant mitigate deficiencies and

1023
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,000
help mobilize those nutrients to where

1024
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,960
the plant needs them but also making

1025
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,320
them more bioavailable in the soil

1026
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,119
fulvic acid really should be

1027
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,760
complemented with a humic acid because

1028
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,599
humic acid being a negative charge holds

1029
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,760
on and attracts to those nutrients for

1030
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,519
when the plant is ready to take them in

1031
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,160
it also holds onto water so if you're

1032
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:36,239
dealing with drought conditions or maybe

1033
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,039
your temperature goes off or your ph

1034
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:41,118
goes off they can all sort of mitigate

1035
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,079
some of those concerns and those

1036
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,480
stressors so really it's almost like a

1037
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,280
buffer program for your nutrient program

1038
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,119
it doesn't replace your nutrients but it

1039
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,519
really helps the nutrients that you're

1040
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,519
putting into your system become more

1041
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,599
readily available be retained better

1042
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,920
within the media so that you're not

1043
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,320
losing it to leachage or in certain

1044
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,200
outdoor situations to gas off if you're

1045
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,800
in an

1046
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,118
outdoor environment you know nitrogen

1047
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,440
tends to be a lot more volatile

1048
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,280
so the combination of the two is

1049
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,920
i think something you start to see if

1050
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,680
you see nutrient products that say

1051
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,720
organic acids in it generally they're

1052
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,838
using

1053
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,039
some form of a humic or a fulvic acid um

1054
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,039
and there's an array of different

1055
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,480
quality of humic and fulvic acids also

1056
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,559
so understanding a little bit more on

1057
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,838
that side is i think

1058
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,759
important to this part of the

1059
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,599
conversation with in terms of nutrient

1060
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,000
availability if that was sort of

1061
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,800
addresses your question london

1062
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,838
yeah i mean we're kind of like it really

1063
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,440
points in the direction that it's going

1064
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,000
to create that chelation and it's going

1065
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,559
to allow those those nutrients that

1066
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,039
would be harder for the roots to access

1067
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,400
and bring up into the system um a lot

1068
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,400
easier um

1069
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,400
and therefore kind of maximizing your

1070
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,240
dollar at the end because we're talking

1071
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,440
about even every time we talk about

1072
00:40:54,239 --> 00:41:00,239
adding something in a nutrient a product

1073
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,559
anything to our soils this is money that

1074
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,679
we're using at that point in time right

1075
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,119
like we're using this uh and these em

1076
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:08,960
admins cost money we might be able to

1077
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,800
anita it's a fantastic example if you

1078
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,800
guys go check out her space she's she's

1079
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,440
just vermiculture so she's supposed to

1080
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,039
fly in and got her own nitrogen source

1081
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,519
and a lot of her nutrients from that

1082
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,480
plant um so there are amazing ways but

1083
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,920
that costs time and effort so you gotta

1084
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,519
understand where these are and something

1085
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,280
like a humic and a volvo product like

1086
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,239
this can really help

1087
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,960
especially the flower get the best and

1088
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,639
the max out of uh your system at the

1089
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,920
very end and kind of utilize as many

1090
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,759
nutrients that wouldn't usually be

1091
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,920
available and that's kind of what you've

1092
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,319
seen kind of in the outcome jamison

1093
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,800
right after using products like uh with

1094
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:44,800
that base

1095
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:49,529
yeah i've seen nothing but positive

1096
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,720
results

1097
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:52,960
[Music]

1098
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:55,118
in london if i could add uh quickly just

1099
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,119
in relation to the conversation about

1100
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,280
you know the topic today about flushing

1101
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,240
and just you know water finishing or

1102
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,200
whatnot

1103
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,598
um

1104
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,838
when you use a human canophulvic in your

1105
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,519
program interestingly when when you're

1106
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,519
having this debate about whether you

1107
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,000
flush with water or

1108
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:14,318
how you taper things off um we've also

1109
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,318
seen that even if you do do stress tests

1110
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,480
with just feeding water that there's

1111
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,400
enough nutrients within that media that

1112
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,318
it helps the plant taper off in that

1113
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,880
finishing stage so you're not

1114
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:27,279
necessarily having to starve your plant

1115
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,640
which some people are of that camp

1116
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,640
others are more

1117
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,000
in the mind of to taper it off and

1118
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,440
that's fine you don't necessarily need

1119
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,519
to be adding additional nutrients when

1120
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,838
you're finishing a plant but the plant

1121
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,838
won't be starved per se because those

1122
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:43,358
nutrients are still available within the

1123
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,559
media so you're kind of depleting it

1124
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:46,400
not necessarily because you're just not

1125
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,519
adding any more to

1126
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,519
your program but it those nutrients are

1127
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:53,679
still there it's just whether or not the

1128
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,119
plant can access it so

1129
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,279
i think jameson you might be finding

1130
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,119
that as well is when you use the humic

1131
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,519
and the phobics at the very end and the

1132
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,760
tail end of that flower stage there's

1133
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,519
still enough nutrients within the media

1134
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,599
that the plants getting essentially what

1135
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,960
it needs and not starving it not

1136
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,400
stressing it but you're still getting

1137
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,000
that finishing benefit

1138
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,838
yeah i mean

1139
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,400
my media is

1140
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:21,039
it it's an it's a no-till dead so it

1141
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,440
stays the way it is and and continues on

1142
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:26,719
but i i have a question as you know i

1143
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,760
was kind of taught that falvik was sort

1144
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,639
of down

1145
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,839
plant

1146
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,799
towards the soil and humic was more

1147
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,279
soil

1148
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,760
towards the plant and so you wanted to

1149
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,160
use a fulvic at the end and not a human

1150
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,119
here am i am i not properly educated on

1151
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:47,440
that would you advise using both

1152
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:50,240
um in concert or how would you do that

1153
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,960
definitely in concert

1154
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,358
the interesting thing about fulvic acid

1155
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,880
is it it like i said it binds to the

1156
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:59,440
nutrients so whether you're using it

1157
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,680
systemically so we have we have growers

1158
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,519
that use uh the fulvic acid strictly

1159
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,358
with their compost teas so that they can

1160
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,519
make the nutrients within those teas

1161
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,598
more mobile and more bioavailable

1162
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,519
it's excellent as a foliar as well

1163
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,920
because by nature fulvic acid has some

1164
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,000
trace to it it's minute but there are

1165
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,680
some additives that you can add to it

1166
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,358
it's also excellent when you combine it

1167
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,598
if you're doing any kind of an organic

1168
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:24,400
ipm it works like a wedding agent and it

1169
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,720
helps those additives better permeate

1170
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,960
into the canopy and help assimilate into

1171
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,439
the plant a lot better so when we

1172
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,519
recommend using humic and fulvic humic

1173
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,920
for sure in the ground at the root zone

1174
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,119
it's the root zone activator it helps to

1175
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,880
support that

1176
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,400
root development it helps to feed the

1177
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,880
biome so if you're using with your

1178
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,358
living soil it becomes a carbon nutrient

1179
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,280
source for your biome which helps

1180
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,759
those populations flourish which is

1181
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,680
obviously going to better empower that

1182
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,240
nutrient cycling that naturally happens

1183
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:56,639
between root zone and biome

1184
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,959
but fulvic can be used 100

1185
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,400
in systemically in ground and furrow you

1186
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,599
can put it in the ground you can put it

1187
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,440
in your nutrient system if you're

1188
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,599
running an irrigation or fertigation

1189
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,800
system and it can also be used as part

1190
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,960
of any kind of an ipm or foliar program

1191
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,720
top to bottom

1192
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,119
[Music]

1193
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:19,519
so while we have a quick pause here i'm

1194
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,318
going to jump in hey everybody welcome

1195
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:22,318
to

1196
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:24,079
the dank hour get growing together where

1197
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,400
we talk about uh where we get the

1198
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,119
dankest minds and cannabis that i know

1199
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,200
together to talk cannabis horticulture

1200
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,720
we are having an amazing discussion

1201
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,480
right now about finishing the perfect

1202
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,078
cannabis plant and i'm not gonna lie to

1203
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,920
you all i've done a little bit of a

1204
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,760
clickbait here because you know what i

1205
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,318
really hate this term flushing and i

1206
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,560
hate this ongoing debate that's going on

1207
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,920
about how we need to remove this or put

1208
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,838
that in now we're talking about

1209
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,280
utilizing and maximizing the potential

1210
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:52,159
of our plant at the end part of the

1211
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,160
cycle and what each individual does to

1212
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,078
create the best outcome that they have

1213
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,318
that we've had we've talked with various

1214
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,800
experts about their methodologies and

1215
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:03,679
thought processes on how to really

1216
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,760
accelerate and create that balance as

1217
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,078
best as possible now we were talking a

1218
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,880
little bit about no-till

1219
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,680
jameson and using humic and phobic

1220
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,880
and i wanted to bounce over to mania a

1221
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,000
little bit now we

1222
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,960
he mentioned this starvation this this

1223
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,318
plant um starvation and you mentioned it

1224
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,240
before now when we're talking about

1225
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,159
flushing often what is what it's talking

1226
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,078
about is actually people leech their

1227
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,838
plant at the end of flower where they

1228
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,000
add so much

1229
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,719
water to the medium that is at least a

1230
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,800
minimum of threefold of the volume of

1231
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:39,358
the media of the medium

1232
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,920
to rinse the plant of nutrients what

1233
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,759
would this do to the end of flower i

1234
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,680
mean theoretically

1235
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,680
you know you see people say oh this is a

1236
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,838
good thing the starvation of the plant

1237
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,838
causes chlorosis which causes the

1238
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:53,679
breakdown of nitrogen in the leaves

1239
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,559
which creates a better tasting plant is

1240
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:59,358
often what is spat out in some

1241
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,440
word-shaped format like i am dictating

1242
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,279
at this point in time to you manny what

1243
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,679
are your like

1244
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,359
is that what happens like is that a good

1245
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,039
thing does that have any benefit to the

1246
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,838
actual flower of the plant what's your

1247
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:11,838
thoughts

1248
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,480
the flower of the plant by that point

1249
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,960
has our is already been

1250
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,400
structured it's already been nurtured

1251
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,358
there there's nothing that you're going

1252
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,880
to do

1253
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,440
that's going to take that away from the

1254
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,119
flower i mean we keep saying the flower

1255
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,039
is a bioaccumulator as a bio accumulator

1256
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,559
you know everything that it's pulled

1257
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,558
into

1258
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,000
into itself it's not going to release

1259
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,440
because you're running straight water

1260
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,280
through it no matter how much you're

1261
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,880
stressing it or starving it

1262
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,280
whatever's there is there it's the

1263
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,318
leaves that are gonna that are going to

1264
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,240
um

1265
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:48,800
give up before

1266
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:51,209
uh any of that would even go anywhere

1267
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,559
near the flower right

1268
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:56,240
[Music]

1269
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,359
yeah sorry i left my mic on there

1270
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:02,639
exactly like you the plant is going to

1271
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:05,838
eat up the nutrition and its leaves to

1272
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:07,598
protect the most important part of its

1273
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,279
vital system what's the most important

1274
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,359
part what's the plant always trying to

1275
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,359
do it's trying to reproduce right manny

1276
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,119
so these are the buds the calyx that's

1277
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:16,960
not gonna pull nutrients from that spot

1278
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,200
that would be ridiculous that's right

1279
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,679
that is that is this the sex of the

1280
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,759
plant and it is going to do everything

1281
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:26,480
in its power to sustain

1282
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,559
that sexual uh part of itself for

1283
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,159
reproduction because that's you know

1284
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,200
that's its life that's what it wants to

1285
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,879
do so by you know running straight water

1286
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,639
for even three weeks it's not going to

1287
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,400
do anything to the bud whatsoever it's

1288
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:42,558
it's it's unfortunately uh you know

1289
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,838
some people like to say bro science i

1290
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,680
mean i'm just going to say it's an old

1291
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,358
wives tale you know that

1292
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,759
people started telling each other that

1293
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:50,719
that would was working but you know as

1294
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,480
we've

1295
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,879
learned more about the plant and learn

1296
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,559
more about the biology of it we can now

1297
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,039
see that that type of thinking isn't

1298
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,640
correct at all and it's you know it's a

1299
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,800
point of argument for a lot of people

1300
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:05,118
that swear by it but

1301
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,599
i can provide all kinds of documented

1302
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:12,720
scientific evidence which shows

1303
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:14,838
that it's absolutely useless even the

1304
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,879
the definition of the plant as a

1305
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:17,920
bioaccumulator spells it out for you

1306
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,358
that no

1307
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,519
flushing isn't going to do anything for

1308
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:23,039
it um unfortunately

1309
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:24,318
you know

1310
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:25,759
i'm not saying those people are doing

1311
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:28,318
anything wrong to their plants because

1312
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,270
really they're not but the thought

1313
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:34,639
process that they're using isn't correct

1314
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:36,800
[Music]

1315
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,639
i think you touched on like a really

1316
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,000
awesome point josh go ahead there before

1317
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,759
you speak but just beforehand i just

1318
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,440
want to touch on that that really

1319
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,920
important point that you dictated there

1320
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,920
is that we are all growing and there are

1321
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,318
all things even when you have huge or

1322
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,318
vast amounts of experience that it's

1323
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,239
it's it's important to have that open

1324
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,838
mind to other ideas and manny just said

1325
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:58,318
it so well there's nothing wrong with

1326
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,239
doing that if that's what you want to do

1327
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:01,679
but i'm going to do it this way right

1328
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:03,039
and this is why and i think that's

1329
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:04,480
really important that's why i love this

1330
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:05,838
panel of experts i'm just going to give

1331
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,159
you guys all an awesome shout out chad

1332
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:10,078
jameson and manny joshua and corey

1333
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,920
because you guys do that you guys have

1334
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,240
this awesome conversation but show that

1335
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,318
there's a reason for it and that this is

1336
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,318
our thought process but this is why you

1337
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,318
could or someone otherwise so really

1338
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,318
thank you so much for having that open

1339
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:25,679
point of protection josh i appreciate

1340
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,519
you holding on for me for a moment going

1341
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,838
not a problem at all i just wanted to

1342
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,920
also add there i think uh you know

1343
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:33,679
potential reason this

1344
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,318
you know issue had come up like i

1345
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:38,000
remember when i was a young grower i

1346
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:39,599
you know being the skeptic decided you

1347
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,280
know i'm gonna test this

1348
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,559
you know flushing or not flushing

1349
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,680
because back then i i flushed my plants

1350
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,920
um

1351
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,159
but back then you know like it didn't

1352
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,800
dawn on me that i should be feeding the

1353
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,078
plant based on its stage of growth so i

1354
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,000
was just like well i'm just gonna keep

1355
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,480
beating it in week seven and eight and

1356
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,079
nine the same way i have you know in

1357
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,559
four five and six

1358
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,559
um so at that point you you know i was

1359
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,000
giving the file way too much nutrients

1360
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,839
for what it needed and that's why it

1361
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,760
accumulated so much and had such a

1362
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:12,318
terrible finish as opposed to the

1363
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,280
product that i had flushed

1364
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:15,279
now

1365
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,440
you know after having learned more about

1366
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,519
the plant and you know learning how the

1367
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,039
growth stages work and what the plant is

1368
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:25,358
requiring in those stages um

1369
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,920
you know i have

1370
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:30,159
i mean the the ptr that i put on there

1371
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,800
was from a sample

1372
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:35,039
that i'd take we'd taken samples that we

1373
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,800
eight nine and ten

1374
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,880
um

1375
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,640
the the plant just to see which you know

1376
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,760
week was best for that particular

1377
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,440
cultivar um but that said and this is

1378
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,200
from the week 8 at the week 8 it was

1379
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,639
still getting

1380
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,039
almost it's

1381
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:53,440
like almost it's full nutrients uh week

1382
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,039
nine had gotten dropped down to a much

1383
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,800
lower rate and we kind of was still at

1384
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:57,759
that much lower rate

1385
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,680
um

1386
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,839
but i mean you know four i mean this

1387
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:03,679
isn't perfectly white but for you know a

1388
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:05,679
week eight was

1389
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:07,679
you know still having quite a decent

1390
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:09,519
amount of nutrients um i think it's

1391
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:12,078
important to note that like the dry and

1392
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:14,400
the cure also really have an impact on

1393
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,240
the final product um

1394
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,519
you can still like the flavor in this

1395
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,959
you can tell that there was you know

1396
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,358
that little extra nutrients

1397
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,000
comparatively to the the week nine and

1398
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,318
week ten samples and the terpene

1399
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,559
profiles are also different

1400
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:29,759
um so yeah i just wanted to kind of add

1401
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,280
that you know

1402
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,960
sometimes people might be thinking that

1403
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,599
this you know the alternative to

1404
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,119
flushing is giving a full feed which you

1405
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,559
know that's not entirely the case you

1406
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,480
know you got to feed it based on the

1407
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,630
stage of growth that it's in

1408
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,280
and thank you

1409
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:47,280
[Music]

1410
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,680
i said yeah and what you're feeding

1411
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,680
really matters i think like

1412
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:53,838
it when you're looking in our beautiful

1413
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:55,279
organic bands like jameson and chad's

1414
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,880
are working in the plant has this

1415
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,519
ability to pull

1416
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,119
what is necessary when it needs it and

1417
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,280
and able to

1418
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,000
figure out everything else otherwise

1419
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,160
right uh that makes it really quite a

1420
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,760
bit cory are you available would you

1421
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:10,799
like to chat a little bit i know you

1422
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,480
were on a phone call a little bit

1423
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,480
earlier um are you available now

1424
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,720
nope okay

1425
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,400
well that's fine we will continue

1426
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:32,558
forward anyway so we were talking um

1427
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,920
about flushing and finishing our

1428
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,680
cannabis plants we'll talk a little bit

1429
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,240
about my

1430
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,440
thought process on it because i

1431
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:41,598
something

1432
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,880
the other people in this room is i kind

1433
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,119
of do

1434
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,838
i'm kind of closer to what manny does as

1435
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:50,240
in i do organic and hydroponic kind of

1436
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:52,639
together and then i use ammonium-based

1437
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:53,919
nitrogen as well as

1438
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:55,838
organic

1439
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,358
nitrogens and teas and stuff like that

1440
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:00,480
to really boost

1441
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:04,000
the plant up as much as possible

1442
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,119
so no that wasn't uh no you're good um

1443
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,280
i'm just

1444
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,480
doing my little ones crying so i got a

1445
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,040
little bit sidetracked there and

1446
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,880
distracted my apologies guys so i'm just

1447
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,759
kind of running through what i do um so

1448
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,960
i'm doing i do as three gallon pots and

1449
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,079
my idealism is that i can create as much

1450
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,920
life

1451
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,000
into these pots as possible and the

1452
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,318
plants going to take what it needs but

1453
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,679
also has everything that it has in it

1454
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:30,000
now i've tried

1455
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,000
different cover crops to do

1456
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,639
and allow for higher

1457
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,440
doses of nitrogen such as clover i find

1458
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:38,960
you get a lot larger of a blood bud um

1459
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,880
at the finish

1460
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,639
um where if you use things like acilium

1461
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,640
which are little flowers they can create

1462
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:46,239
a smaller bud because they're sucking a

1463
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:48,000
little bit more nitrogen out but when it

1464
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:50,719
comes to the last part of the end of my

1465
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,400
cycle is i tapered down my nutrient

1466
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:53,919
system a lot i'm probably running close

1467
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,960
to what manny runs maybe a little bit

1468
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,280
higher at about 200 ppm but i'm also in

1469
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,000
a drain to waste hydroponic system so

1470
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:05,040
every time i i water i water with about

1471
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,480
10 runoff and check my ppm and that's a

1472
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:08,639
great dictation i think it's important

1473
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,599
to know that there are even some

1474
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,400
um

1475
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,280
strains and and phenotypes that really

1476
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,358
if you over feed it can be way more

1477
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,040
detrimental than if you under feed and

1478
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,798
some plants just love to eat you can

1479
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,880
just give them as much nutrients as

1480
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:29,119
possible and really push them up to you

1481
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:31,440
know 30 to 2800 ppm at their highest in

1482
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,358
mid to mid flower like you can really

1483
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,280
push them up high

1484
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:37,440
and that's great but trying to

1485
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,680
maintain when you have a plant that

1486
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,798
can't take those high ppms and trying to

1487
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:42,399
push it up all the time isn't

1488
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:44,079
necessarily the best way to go sometimes

1489
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,838
reducing them can be and then it's a

1490
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,519
cost point right if you're putting

1491
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:48,798
depending on the amount of nutrients

1492
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,960
that you're putting into your system is

1493
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,358
coming out so that's why when i do a lot

1494
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,240
of like gallon pot work where you have

1495
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:57,920
uh drainage it's okay to check your ppms

1496
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:59,919
on the way out and see kind of what

1497
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,599
they're sitting at i always have 10

1498
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,838
runoff i know that's a little bit

1499
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,480
backwards because i'm doing hydroponics

1500
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:10,159
and organics but i find this way i can

1501
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,920
really tally and find out how much is in

1502
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:13,920
and being rinsed out of the stem holiday

1503
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,159
plant is taken up it's really really

1504
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,000
helpful and that's the big learning

1505
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:20,000
curve i think that

1506
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,599
organics is so challenging for a lot of

1507
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,639
people is because you have to plan and

1508
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,960
work ahead um yeah i mean jamison your

1509
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,679
bed is like immediately ready to go

1510
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,358
right after right after your flowering

1511
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,118
cycle is done so you can pop right on

1512
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:34,078
top of it maybe amend a little bit what

1513
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,400
do you do

1514
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,519
in the transition period from the end of

1515
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,559
flower to the last one to uh to running

1516
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:44,719
your next round in the same bed

1517
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,990
what's your flip what's your transition

1518
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:46,879
there

1519
00:56:44,989 --> 00:56:50,159
[Music]

1520
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,240
i'm still learning soil biology so what

1521
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,480
i'll do is i'll go to a l labs here in

1522
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:56,798
canada i'll get a soil test and then i'm

1523
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,559
lucky to have friends like you know

1524
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:00,798
jazz or like lately i've been working

1525
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,720
with joshua stevensland who's you know

1526
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:05,440
analyzed soil tests for me since back in

1527
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,919
the day um and then sort of work with

1528
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,920
him to

1529
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,199
figure out the right strategy for an

1530
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,920
amendment the top amendment and then

1531
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:16,558
water in and just roll like you know you

1532
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,760
can clamp in and then sort of send your

1533
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,960
test off and amend it after so

1534
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,480
um

1535
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,720
you know you don't need a lot to get

1536
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,599
those starts going so yeah i mean i'm

1537
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,199
still learning i'm you know only on my

1538
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,599
third

1539
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:33,679
you know third year of doing this so

1540
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,079
it's uh you know the living soil is just

1541
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,399
a wormhole that you you know continue to

1542
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,680
go down

1543

[Music]

1544
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:42,409
what about yourself chaz what are you

1545
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:45,838
what are you doing in between

1546

[Music]

1547
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,440
uh i do something similar as jameson

1548
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,318
does uh

1549
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,519
you know depends on

1550
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:58,400
you know sometimes i'll skip a a cycle

1551
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,639
um you know if it's just my homegrown to

1552
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,838
get it tested but i try to get it tested

1553
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:03,039
so i'm not

1554
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:04,719
um

1555
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,719
adding more of something that doesn't

1556
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:10,159
need to be in my soil

1557
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,439
because it's really about keeping

1558
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:13,039
each element

1559
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,720
uh

1560
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:17,599
you know your

1561
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:20,959
micro and macro nutrients

1562
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,838
in the proper ratios within your soil

1563
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,798
for your plant to uptake them correctly

1564
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:26,400
so

1565
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,880
if

1566
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,000
you just keep on blindly amending over

1567
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,599
time

1568
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
you don't know what the plant is

1569
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,519
utilizing and where your bed stands and

1570
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,480
you can

1571
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:40,318
run into issues that then might require

1572
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,280
a lot more

1573
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:45,599
fertilizer to bring up the ratios into

1574
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,000
the correct level than you would have if

1575
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,559
you um

1576
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,519
if you would have just you know as you

1577
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,119
went

1578
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,679
check your soil

1579
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,960
through laboratory testing and keep it

1580
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:58,078
within those

1581
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,559
the sort of

1582
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:03,359
ranges and if you are getting your soil

1583
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,798
tested um you'll get a lot of different

1584
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,440
opinions on

1585
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:10,559
you know who's got good lab testing my

1586
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:14,559
advice on it is uh just stick with the

1587
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,839
same one that you're going with and um

1588
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,119
and go from there

1589
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:21,838
because you'll

1590
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:24,400
each each lab is calibrated differently

1591
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,759
and if you go from one to another

1592
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,079
uh

1593
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:32,720
you won't be able to

1594
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:35,280
interpolate understand your data um

1595
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:37,598
over time because it will be skewed

1596
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,240
so just stick with one lab so you get

1597
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,200
the big screenshot of what their

1598
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:45,279
testing is like and uh and you can

1599
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:47,049
adjust accordingly

1600
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,319
and i'm done

1601
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:51,200
[Music]

1602
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:53,119
that sounds like exactly what i like to

1603
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:55,039
point out at all times that is always

1604
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,400
about creating community a bit around

1605
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:57,838
you i mean if you're going to choose a

1606
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,920
soil

1607
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,558
company that's going to test your soil

1608
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,119
out on the regular basis stick with them

1609
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,798
and go through them we're all developing

1610
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,720
businesses thing happen just because

1611
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,400
there's one error one time doesn't mean

1612
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:11,679
you should bounce around immediately

1613
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,519
don't get me wrong there are crappy

1614
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:15,118
businesses out there so definitely make

1615
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,759
the right decision that depends on you

1616
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,838
but i i think where it's about community

1617
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,520
giving maybe a smaller guy a chance once

1618
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:24,000
in a while is very important in this

1619
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:26,239
space um i mean you guys all let me

1620
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,358
bring you here to this wacky weird

1621

1622

1623
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:36,720
hour so what we usually like to do is is

1624
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:39,838
end our recorded session at about this

1625
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:42,239
time and then bounce over over to the

1626
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:45,039
