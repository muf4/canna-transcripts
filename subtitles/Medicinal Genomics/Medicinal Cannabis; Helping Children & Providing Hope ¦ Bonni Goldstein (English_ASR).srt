00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,750
my name is Bonnie Goldstein and I'm a

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,269
licensed physician in the state of

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,149
California and I have a medical practice

4
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:20,980
called Kenna centers and what we do is

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,419
educate and help patients use medical

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,810
cannabis for their serious and chronic

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,960
medical conditions my talk at kin med is

8
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:32,018
going to be about my medical practice in

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,539
terms of what I'm seeing with patients

10
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:36,100
so overall what I'm seeing with chronic

11
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:38,079
pain patients what I'm seeing with

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,969
cancer patients what I'm seeing in the

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,179
pediatric epilepsy population that I'm

14
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:45,039
taken care of sharing those stories and

15
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,500
talking about how patients are using

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,738
this to improve the quality of their

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,478
lives can med is a really important

18
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:54,279
conference and one is because it really

19
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:56,228
does target the science so they get the

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,829
best scientists they get doctors they

21
00:00:56,228 --> 00:01:01,298
get researchers they get people who are

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,488
maybe in other fields who now have

23
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:05,769
crossed over and that's important

24
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:08,200
everybody's passionate and everybody's

25
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:12,429
sharing ideas and it's all with the same

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,230
goal is to help our fellow mankind many

27
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,220
of the parents that come to see me are

28
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,850
really nervous

29
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:22,299
and once they start using it they say oh

30
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,919
well wow this is really working and you

31
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,200
know they have a lot of anxiety because

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,359
they've been through so many different

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,430
things already and so many of them

34
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,129
aren't trusting and they're afraid to

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,990
hope and all they need to do is to see

36
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:37,929
that there is something there and then

37
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:39,549
they they just say okay now I need to

38
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,010
tell everybody about this because why

39
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:44,289
should anybody else be suffering there's

40
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,810
a little girl that kind of comes to mind

41
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:51,070
who came to see me who has numerous

42
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:53,590
medical issues and including seizures

43
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,329
and she tried multiple different

44
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,310
medications and although some of them

45
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,560
work to reduce the seizures all of them

46
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,840
had terrible side effects so we started

47
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,750
her on cannabis oil and she was able to

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,430
wean off those medications and she came

49
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,049
to see me when she was about seven or

50
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,229
eight years old and she wasn't able to

51
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:11,900
read or write

52
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:15,170
and by 10:00 she was reading and writing

53
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,849
and having much less seizures and I just

54
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,878
feel really lucky as a doctor to

55
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:22,128
actually be able to help people truly

56
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:25,158
feel better if this were to go away

57
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:27,679
people would use it off the black market

58
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:29,209
and it would be unregulated I know that

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,830
there are people in states where they

60
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,348
don't have medical cannabis they're

61
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,019
using it because their child is sick and

62
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:38,328
their child is better on it who wouldn't

63
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:41,120
do that for their child I have met

64
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:43,370
people at conferences who came because

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,890
they're curious but they're still

66
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,620
doubtful and then they start to listen

67
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:51,169
and they hear a doctor from a

68
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,560
prestigious university speak about their

69
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:56,568
research and then they hear a someone

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,579
from another country who's allowed to do

71
00:02:56,568 --> 00:03:00,318
research for instance dr. Michelle him

72
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,719
from Israel came to speak about his

73
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,119
experience last year and then they hear

74
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,430
from me about my patient experiences and

75
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,770
they say well there is something to this

76
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:35,908
and that starts them on the journey

77
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:35,909
