55
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,799
is mark jordan mark is currently the

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
chief executive officer

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,760
at minnibis which is headquartered in

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,840
longmont colorado

59
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,479
it is a tissue culture lab dedicated to

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,640
cannabis research and development

61
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,079
his previous positions include work at

62
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,958
colorado seed

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,719
eurofins biodiagnostics and the denver

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,280
botanic gardens

65
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,840
while at the denver botanic gardens mark

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,840
worked as a research horticulturist

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,039
running the protocol creation tissue

68
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,400
culture lab

69
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,840
this experience allowed him to

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,840
understand the potential for the

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
application of tissue culture for the

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,239
cannabis industry

73
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,318
and set him on the path he is on now

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,159
as you might expect mark and i spent a

75
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,679
lot of time talking about the tissue

76
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,359
culture process

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,719
mark was kind enough to walk me through

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
the basics of the process

79
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,158
including the four stages of plant

80
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,799
tissue culture

81
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,519
we also got into how tissue culture

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,239
propagation

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,120
differs from clonal propagation how

84
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,680
tissue culture

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,319
can be used to remediate plants infected

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
with pathogens or viruses

87
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,799
germinating seeds in tissue culture dark

88
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,759
rooting in tissue culture

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,040
and more even if you've never grown a

90
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,878
cannabis plant before

91
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,239
i think you will find this conversation

92
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,079
interesting i know i did

93
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,480
before we get to my conversation with

94
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,360

126
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,639
good afternoon mark thanks for joining

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,759
us um

128
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,759
hey ben how's it going it's going good

129
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,360
and i i appreciate you taking the time

130
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,840
to talk with me today

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
and i hope you'll forgive me if my line

132
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,239
of questioning

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,960
is a bit rudimentary i myself am not

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,560
a cultivation expert and thankfully i

135
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,879
trust many folks listening

136
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,079
are not either are not either so

137
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,680
hopefully they'll appreciate

138
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,279
me keeping things a little basic however

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,800
i do have a ton of respect and

140
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,599
admiration for the folks

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,439
who are good cultivators mainly because

142
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,439
i have grown cannabis myself

143
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,879
and can attest to the fact that it's not

144
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,680
nearly as simple as it seems

145
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,319
but you take cultivation and propagation

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,680
to

147
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:37,199
a whole nother level with tissue culture

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,879
so first i was hoping for those who are

149
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,800
not familiar with tissue culture

150
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,159
could you please give us kind of a

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,720
general overview

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
of what that process is okay yeah

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
definitely

154
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,918
um so what i tend to tell people for the

155
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,159
first time that are just kind of

156
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,519
learning about it getting into it is

157
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,800
along the lines of

158
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,279
tissue culture is growing a plant from a

159
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
small

160
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,839
group of cells in a sterile environment

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,199
generally in a test tube or something

162
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,000
along those lines

163
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,240
in a media that is all the hormones

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,720
nutrients and vitamins the plant needs

165
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,360
to grow thrive stay alive

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,440
and the substance you're growing it in

167
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,280
imagine it's a jello packet

168
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,759
with all those nutrients hormones and

169
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:24,478
vitamins included so the plant sits

170
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,479
in a fairly firm sort of media

171
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,478
okay so why is this process better than

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
the tried and true putting a seed into

173
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,800
the ground

174
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,038
so the biggest reason is

175
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,840
you get a consistent plant the same way

176
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,918
you would get

177
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,159
with cuttings um if you take a lot of

178
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,599
cuttings you're going to get that same

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,639
height on every plant by the time

180
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,680
they're done you're going to get the

181
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,639
same structure

182
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,959
spread all that sort of things seeds

183
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,319
actually grow about 20 percent faster

184
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,359
than they standard just

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,360
cutting and so seeds are actually a very

186
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,400
viable method to grow a plant the only

187
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
problem is

188
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,079
if they're not completely purebred lines

189
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
you don't actually know what you're

190
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,199
going to get 100

191
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
of the time you might have a little bit

192
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,759
of difference in flour

193
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,280
or height or bud density so in general

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,038
just taking cuttings

195
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,478
allows for a more even canopy throughout

196
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,639
your whole process

197
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,839
and then on top of that if you go into

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,160
tissue culture

199
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,560
what you start to see is those plants

200
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,560
now you can culture out of viruses

201
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,639
you can culture out of insects other

202
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,879
pathogens things like that

203
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,079
and that way instead of taking just the

204
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,918
cutting where you might have a little

205
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,519
bit of contamination or something else

206
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,198
that goes on where you're cutting has a

207
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,279
root rot let's say

208
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,560
you don't deal with any of that it's

209
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,959
strictly

210
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,839
growing a plant that started off super

211
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,318
healthy and accelerating the growth to

212
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,679
i'd say it's comparable to a seed so

213
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,120
that extra 20

214
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,840
bonus on top of it so i'm glad that you

215
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,560
mentioned

216
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,000
viruses because here on the medicinal

217
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,839
genomic side we're

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,759
working with testing labs and

219
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,560
cultivators to develop

220
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,160
some assays in order to test plants for

221
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,319
certain viruses mainly

222
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
obsolete and viroid and lettuce

223
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,759
chlorosis virus

224
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,839
and cannabis cryptos cryptic virus as

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,240
well and i know

226
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,758
that there is a way to sort of tissue

227
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,800
culture out that virus if you were to

228
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
identify it

229
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,919
so i was wondering if you could kind of

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,560
explain to me how

231
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,639
how exactly does that work okay yeah

232
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,160
definitely and actually using an assay

233
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,840
like that i could see being super

234
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
beneficial and i'll kind of touch on

235
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,519
that too

236
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,278
um so when you're going to culture out

237
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,120
of a virus you need to understand what

238
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,799
the meristem of a plant is

239
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,320
if you don't understand what ameristem

240
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,838
is your failure rate's going to go

241
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,278
through the roof

242
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,080
ameristem is the smallest new growth

243
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,039
of cells essentially that the plant

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,959
creates

245
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,480
that is undifferentiated tissue it

246
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,559
doesn't know yet if it's going to be a

247
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
shoot a root a leaf

248
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,479
those sort of things it's just a mass

249
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,920
cluster of cells

250
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,920
and the only reason it cultures quote

251
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,039
unquote out of a virus is the virus

252
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:10,319
has not had time to actually infect that

253
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,319
brand new batch of cells which is why

254
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
you're always taking from the smallest

255
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,200
amounts possible

256
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,200
if you take something that has

257
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
everything including a little bit more

258
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,759
than the meristem

259
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
there's a good chance you haven't

260
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,319
actually cultured out of the virus

261
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,439
and even if you pulled it out of culture

262
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,278
you grew it out

263
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
you might not see the virus express

264
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,159
until you took cuttings a second time

265
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,759
potentially

266
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,240
so testing for that's extremely crucial

267
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,759
and i always would recommend a molecular

268
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,320
test at that point

269
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,559
um if you just tried to do it by visual

270
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
visual identification

271
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,319
i could see a lot of failure running

272
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,039
into problems down the line so

273
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,000
definitely strips or molecular type

274
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,838
stuff

275
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,799
um if that helps yeah so it seems that

276
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,440
it's really critical that you take just

277
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,319
that

278
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,279
little that little bit off the the very

279
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,519
um

280
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,439
end of the plant or where exactly on the

281
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,399
plant are you taking that cutting is it

282
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
at the tip or is it somewhere else so

283
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,159
it's just a meristem

284
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,599
um if you i'd actually recommend if you

285
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,838
really want to like look into it to

286
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,519
google what ameristem is it's spelled um

287
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,360
m-e-r-i-s-t-e-m and essentially it can

288
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,639
be there's root meristems there's shoot

289
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,320
meristems

290
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,319
uh the definition i think is something

291
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,839
along the lines of the newest growth

292
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,560
point on a plant

293
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,760
so it's right where any time you see new

294
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,159
tissue coming out

295
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:38,159
it would be right there you have lateral

296
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:41,919
meristems auxiliary meristems

297
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,919
so it's just that brand new growth point

298
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,719
i would recommend if i were to take

299
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,639
a new bit of cuttings or a new tissue

300
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,160
culture from a meristem cut

301
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:54,078
i would use the very top uh of the plant

302
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,439
right where the normal bud would form or

303
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,439
something like that

304
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,399
i haven't seen a lot of success with

305
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,160
root meristem cultures

306
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,039
and how small are we talking is this

307
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,000
like a grain of rice is this

308
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,719
uh cut a grain of rice into maybe

309
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
eighths

310
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,320
and you're taking a bit of tissue about

311
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,560
like that so you need a microscope

312
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,079
in order to do it uh at least if you

313
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,399
want to do it accurately

314
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,599
i've seen some people kind of eyeball it

315
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,679
a little bit and

316
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
i guess if you really wanted to try and

317
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,319
it was your first time or something

318
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,639
that may be a semi-acceptable method but

319
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,320
you're not going to guarantee accuracy

320
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,159
unless you have that like dissection

321
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,519
microscope or something even a little

322
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,600
stronger potentially

323
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,519
that you can actually focus on pulling

324
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
back the leaf primordia to get to that

325
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,679
main meristem

326
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,078
the leaf primordia are the new leaves

327
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,319
that

328
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,879
form before they actually form a true

329
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,639
leaf that you'd see

330
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:55,360
okay wow so that's very precise process

331
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:58,000
yes so i did watch your canmed 2019

332
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,000
presentation the video is up on kim at

333
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
events.com for folks i encourage them to

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
take a look at that as well

335
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,279
and i hope you liked it i did i i

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,480
learned a lot and

337
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:11,360
you know um i think with you

338
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,879
and really a lot of the other presenters

339
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,240
i think you're trying to get across so

340
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,919
much information and you're trying to

341
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,278
pack in so many things that

342
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,039
um and then again me not being a

343
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,480
cultivation expert i did get lost a

344
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,159
little bit so i'm happy that i have you

345
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,720
here and i can kind of uh

346
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,919
slow things down a bit and kind of walk

347
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,560
through the thing so that

348
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,679
that didn't quite didn't quite connect

349
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,679
in my mind so

350
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,759
you did do a great job though of going

351
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,799
through the four different stages

352
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,319
of the tissue culture process so i was

353
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,120
hoping if you might

354
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
forgive me but if you wouldn't mind sort

355
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,000
of going through those

356
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,000
a bit again yeah yeah sure um

357
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,078
so there are four main stages that most

358
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
people would think of as tissue culture

359
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,239
stages you can do them

360
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,040
out of order if you want to uh which is

361
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,000
why the

362
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,759
definitions get a little bit uh blurred

363
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,399
in between the lines

364
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,278
yeah and sorry i didn't mean to to cut

365
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
you off but

366
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,679
let's kind of continue as as if we

367
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,240
you've taken the the sample that

368
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,838
that meristem and now we want to just

369
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,200
take it through the entire process maybe

370
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,000
that would be a good way to

371
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,278
do it awesome okay so what you do is you

372
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,159
take that meristem

373
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,000
and right before you do anything with it

374
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,319
you'd actually take a little bit bigger

375
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,639
amount of tissue and you'd run it

376
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,760
through a solution of about i'd say

377
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,120
10 to 20 bleach depending on how long

378
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,399
you let it sit in there

379
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,240
there's different protocols for

380
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,720
different plants i tried to stay around

381
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,000
the

382
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,680
10 to 15 but you could go as high as 20

383
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,440
and you mix it with a chemical called

384
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,679
tween 20 which is

385
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,880
just imagine a soap essentially that's

386
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,278
pretty much what it is

387
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,198
that doesn't change the ionic properties

388
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,679
meaning it doesn't change your ph

389
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,120
or mix with anything in a weird way it

390
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,719
literally is just

391
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,159
something they use in beauty products or

392
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,800
shampoos or

393
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,559
tissue culture so you take your bleach

394
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,319
you mix it with your tween 20 to let it

395
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,958
penetrate the plant tissue a little bit

396
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
better

397
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,198
and it just scrubs and kills anything

398
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:11,919
that might be on the surface of the

399
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,719
tissue

400
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,519
itself if your bleach concentration is

401
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,278
too high

402
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,198
you actually get a bleaching of the

403
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,439
tissue so the tissue loses its

404
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,039
chlorophyll pigments and it just turns

405
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,519
white that's how you know you damage the

406
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,078
tissue

407
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,078
before you put it into culture so that's

408
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,359
all called the initiation stage you're

409
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,879
cleaning the tissue

410
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,039
you're getting it prepped and then

411
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,240
you're putting it into the test tube for

412
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,799
the first time

413
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,159
that generally can take like a good hour

414
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,759
to get ready if you're

415
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,078
you know taking your time really making

416
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,078
sure everything's set doing well

417
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,679
just even rinsing the plant i would

418
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,439
always run it under water at first

419
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,559
before i even added the bleach

420
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,240
and that way any bacteria or fungus that

421
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,078
might have easily been knocked off it

422
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,000
just gave it that little bit more

423
00:14:54,078 --> 00:15:00,879
extra agitation that you could use um

424
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,839
so all that's the initiation stage and

425
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,919
from initiation

426
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,120
sorry if i might stop you there did i

427
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,719
hear you correct saying that

428
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,120
in addition to the meristem you're

429
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,680
taking another tissue sample

430
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,240
so it's all part of the same tissue

431
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,799
sample

432
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,799
you take something bigger when you

433
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,159
surface sterilize your tissue and then

434
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,838
you cut it down

435
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,198
once it's underneath your hood in that

436
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,320
sterile environment

437
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,559
so imagine initiation would be that

438
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
you go out to the greenhouse or the grow

439
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,278
or whatever it is

440
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,440
you cut the little top part off your

441
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,360
plant and you bring back

442
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199
i'd say a fairly large cutting just to

443
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,159
make it easy to work with

444
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,519
um from that point i would cut it down

445
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,519
to maybe

446
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,039
a half an inch or so something like that

447
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
if i was going to start with meristem

448
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,198
culture

449
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,039
and that's when i'd kind of run it

450
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,719
through the sink for a while really get

451
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,719
all the agitation going

452
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,079
try and get some bacteria fungus or

453
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,240
anything else that might be on there to

454
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,239
kind of release and let go

455
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,000
um and then i'd run it through that

456
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,560
bleach solution that 20

457
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,399
with the bleach with the tween 20. i

458
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,399
generally would use like a drop or two

459
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,039
you don't need a whole lot

460
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,240
okay i i understand so you're not going

461
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,159
out into the greenhouse with your

462
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
microscope and taking off that little

463
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,519
piece

464
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,958
got it yeah that makes a lot more sense

465
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,078
i'll get into this so at that point

466
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,879
you're gonna be

467
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,879
moving it to a sterile laminar flow hood

468
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,679
it's very different from a fume hood

469
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,559
fume hood suck fumes out laminar flow

470
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,638
hoods

471
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,119
filter it vacuums have a hepa filter on

472
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,680
them

473
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,159
uh laminar fume hoods or laminar flow

474
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,799
hoods

475
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,480
have a hepa filter on them as well and

476
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,120
it basically pushes the air through that

477
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
filter

478
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,440
and sterilizes all the air that goes

479
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,560
through it because the particle sizes

480
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,959
for those filters

481
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,239
are so small that the bacterial spores

482
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,000
or the fungal spores

483
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,000
literally just can't penetrate they get

484
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,958
caught up in there and get stuck

485
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
so you're now blowing clean very fresh

486
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,638
air

487
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,079
at yourself and onto your plants onto

488
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,240
your cuttings

489
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,159
and this is the point where you have

490
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,480
sterile water prepped and things like

491
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,480
that

492
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,919
you basically take your plant out of

493
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,318
your bleach solution

494
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,439
you do like a triple rinse in sterile

495
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,918
water to make sure

496
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,759
no other pathogens are present and then

497
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,160
you take sterile scalpel blades and you

498
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,959
really

499
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,319
cut down all the primordial leaf tissue

500
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,318
you cut everything off

501
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,159
until you get to that very small

502
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,078
meristem it's it's generally a very

503
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,240
small cluster of cells

504
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:30,960
and you place that in your media um

505
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,480
that is all the initiation stage right

506
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,600
there it's all getting the plant

507
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,279
from the greenhouse all the way into a

508
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,719
test tube for the first time in a

509
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,918
sterile environment

510
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,519
and there's a couple steps where you

511
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,600
just have to keep making sure you're

512
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,279
getting cleaner and cleaner as you go

513
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,159
and you don't accidentally contaminate

514
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:50,399
anything in the process

515
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,640
right because as you mentioned in your

516
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,360
in your presentation

517
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,000
you're basically just putting them the

518
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,798
sample

519
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,480
into a culture that is favorable for

520
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,519
growing not just cannabis but

521
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,960
pretty much anything else too so if

522
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,359
there's any sort of

523
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,240
microbial contamination that comes along

524
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,678
with that

525
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,599
it's going to grow and probably take

526
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,640
over the culture right yep so i'm

527
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,319
actually going to

528
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,840
touch on that really quick i realized

529
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,279
when i was doing that presentation i

530
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,480
didn't really explain

531
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,279
there are things like penicillin they

532
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,279
developed

533
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,639
by seeing two different a fungus and a

534
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,678
bacteria compete

535
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,840
and they realized there was an um

536
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,600
an anti i think it was a bacterial at

537
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,199
the time present don't quote me on that

538
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,959
not a hundred percent

539
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,798
long story short though as they use

540
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,000
those antibiotics

541
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:42,960
in the culture media to

542
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,599
get rid of a specific bacteria specific

543
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,000
uh

544
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,798
thing like that and let's say bacteria

545
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,960
media

546
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,400
whereas tissue culture media since

547
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,798
you're growing a plant

548
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,559
you generally don't add antibiotics in

549
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,759
it can affect how the plant hormones are

550
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,079
produced or how the plant

551
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,919
actually grows and so to remove all the

552
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,839
variables you just leave it out

553
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,080
making it a prime environment for the

554
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,959
bacteria or the fungus depending on what

555
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,639
you have

556
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,160
to actually either come out of your

557
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,120
plant from

558
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,640
endophytes or just uh come out of the

559
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,678
surface tissue if it wasn't

560
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,200
quite sterilized properly right

561
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,559
got it okay so have we covered

562
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,038
initiation

563
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,558
um that was all initiation yep so

564
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,119
multiplication

565
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,798
this step super easy all you're doing is

566
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,918
initiation you're growing that

567
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,839
meristem or that auxiliary node uh

568
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,600
just a little bit further to the point

569
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,319
where you can take more cuttings off of

570
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,639
it

571
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,519
and once you can take more cuttings you

572
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
just

573
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,160
you take them they're already sterile

574
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,678
you don't need to go through the whole

575
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,279
bleach process again

576
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,600
and you just split those up into other

577
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,399
vessels i generally would use test tubes

578
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,240
when i started

579
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
so if i reference test tubes just

580
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,558
realize it's a culture vessel

581
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,319
in some way it's a sterilized vessel

582
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,319
that has been

583
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,038
pre-discontent decontaminated and you're

584
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,119
now

585
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,879
putting the plant in that uh media is

586
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,319
already in it you've already prepped

587
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,919
everything and you're just expanding

588
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,279
your plant mass

589
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,440
exponentially the max i got from one 25

590
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,480
millimeter test tube in diameter

591
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,240
was i think 25 to 30 cuts off the one

592
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,120
plane

593
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,240
wow so are these basically the same size

594
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,879
as that original

595
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,159
meristem no not at all because the

596
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,200
initial meristem

597
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,919
if you can culture out of the virus past

598
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,440
that point

599
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,120
all the other tissue you're culturing

600
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,720
will be virus free so you don't need to

601
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,519
keep going through that process every

602
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,279
time

603
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,119
i will also mention if you take a

604
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,240
meristem culture you do have the chance

605
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,479
of mutation

606
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,359
because the meristem if it mutates

607
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,159
that's where you see

608
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,639
weird variable changes in the leaf

609
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
tissue

610
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,679
how stuff might look how stuff might

611
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,000
grow

612
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,280
just because you're taking such a small

613
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,119
amount of cells

614
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,558
when it goes to grow out let's say

615
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,759
another shoot

616
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,839
you might have missed some of that

617
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,279
genetic code it might have changed it up

618
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,839
slightly because you didn't take the

619
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,079
full meristem

620
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,599
okay so when you're taking those

621
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,639
cuttings off that

622
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:11,439
original tissue culture so how big is it

623
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,400
at this point how how much has it grown

624
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,200
um it's variable based off your

625
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,798
container

626
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,240
generally i'd have something because i

627
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,158
was using the test tubes

628
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,359
25 millimeters in diameter kind of

629
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,200
crammed in there

630
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:27,279
and maybe uh three inches tall

631
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,480
something like that they're still fairly

632
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,480
small though and

633
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,759
you just keep cutting every single node

634
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,798
that popped off

635
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:37,038
uh into a new tube

636
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,279
okay so is the idea that this tissue

637
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,400
culture is just going to continually

638
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,839
um grow off new shoots that you're just

639
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
going to be cutting off and then putting

640
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,839
into a new tube

641
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,959
for simple terms yes um i want to

642
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,879
preface that with

643
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,200
that only lasts for so long before you

644
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
get weird genetic mutations that go on

645
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,360
because

646
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,839
the plant has not had a chance to

647
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:03,359
express all its genes

648
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,240
so i'll get into that here too once we

649
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,479
you know we're talking about

650
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,279
multiplication and everything but once

651
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,279
you hit that

652
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,359
fifth generation or so is what i've been

653
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,599
told of multiplication

654
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,199
you definitely start to run into a lot

655
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,038
of other issues where

656
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,038
genetic deformities might happen you

657
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,640
might stunt your plant growth because

658
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,319
it has not had that time to develop

659
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,240
it's normal it's normal natural

660
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,678
processes whether that's a terpene

661
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,480
profile potentially

662
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,159
a smell it might need a certain nutrient

663
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,519
that it's not quite getting in the

664
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,440
nutrients that you're constantly

665
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,240
providing it um

666
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,360
i was always making my own nutrients

667
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,159
when i do this

668
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,599
and so i would use i think it was 28

669
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,760
different bottles of

670
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:50,399
let's say um ammonium nitrate or

671
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,319
mono potassium phosphate just the

672
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,159
individual chemicals that would build up

673
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,359
that fertilizer in itself

674
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,039
so if you miss one or the

675
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:58,639
concentration's not high enough that's

676
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,240
what i'm more talking about you start to

677
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,400
run into an issue

678
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,480
over multiple generations where it's

679
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,759
just missing something

680
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:12,079
okay so how long can you

681
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,079
typically keep one going

682
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:17,759
that's an interesting question i tried

683
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,120
to do transfers roughly every two to

684
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,359
four weeks

685
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,279
the sooner the better because then your

686
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,719
media doesn't degrade something like

687
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,879
iron in your media

688
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,640
it was light sensitive and so the light

689
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,799
would start to break it down

690
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,759
and you'd run into issues of the plant

691
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,960
being

692
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,879
deficient in iron the longest i had a

693
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,720
culture sitting at room temperature i

694
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,559
think was about nine to ten months

695
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,200
without touching it

696
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,558
and it started to do a couple weird

697
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,960
things at certain points

698
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,879
and then push new growth and then do

699
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,798
some more when i say weird things

700
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,960
generate callous kind of like you'd see

701
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,798
right after you try rooting a cutting

702
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,240
how the bottom kind of bulges out and

703
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:57,200
everything but it hasn't quite built

704
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,200
roots yet

705
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,440
um that same sort of tissue starts to

706
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,480
form after the plant's been in the media

707
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,400
for a while

708
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,319
the hormones change up enough to allow

709
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,480
it to do that

710
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,399
and so now will it continue to grow over

711
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,000
that nine months or is it sort of in

712
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,919
like a weird suspension um

713
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,159
it'll grow a little bit but it's mostly

714
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,080
in suspension at that point

715
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,679
um a lot of culture that just sits there

716
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,199
for a while i mean it's not

717
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,038
it doesn't have all that nitrogen

718
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,080
constantly being pushing or pushing it

719
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,158
to grow

720
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,439
so you're lacking the nutrients it

721
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,200
actually needs to really

722
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,880
bulk up and get huge very quickly

723
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,360
okay all right is that

724
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,559
did we cover multiplication um the only

725
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,759
other thing i'm going to talk about

726
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,480
there is

727
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,000
during the initial initiation and

728
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,480
multiplication stages

729
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
you're going to be using generally the

730
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,038
same hormone or some hormone blend

731
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,599
fairly

732
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,759
similar where you use something called a

733
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,959
cytokinin

734
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,400
which is it causes growth of the stem

735
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,798
mostly rather than

736
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,519
expansion of the leaves and or rooting

737
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:05,119
so much

738
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,639
so you're just trying to form more and

739
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,918
more stem bits

740
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,038
and more lateral nodes to kind of form

741
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,880
rather than

742
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,400
trying to get your plant to root or get

743
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,720
everything bigger

744
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,320
when i say bigger i'm talking imagine

745
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
you have a leaf that

746
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,119
is really stressed it'll remain smaller

747
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,360
if it gets more oxen that lethal

748
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,319
it'll become huge i've been kind of

749
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,158
surprised

750
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,839
some of the cultures i get out if i had

751
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,440
if i added too much oxen

752
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,278
one of them would be the size of like my

753
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,640
pinky nail and then another leaf might

754
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,359
be the size of my thumb

755
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,799
if it had more ox in it just random

756
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,599
things like that

757
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,720
um and actually i'll touch on that too i

758
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,879
want to talk about

759
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,759
germinating some seeds and tubes here

760
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,080
and so that's

761
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,519
another bit that kind of goes hand in

762
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,278
hand with it but yeah that's

763
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,359
initiation and multiplication right

764
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,000
there

765
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,879
excellent so then we move on to rooting

766
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,359
correct

767
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,000
yep rooting um this was one of the

768
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:05,119
hardest stages i found in cannabis

769
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,278
um when you go to root

770
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,399
i recommended it at canmed2 i'm still in

771
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,159
this mindset of

772
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,000
look at the rooting hormones you're

773
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,559
constantly using on your plants

774
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,558
not using tissue culture and basically

775
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:17,440
try and mimic those rooting hormones

776
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,678
inside

777
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,919
culture conditions or in vitro

778
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,880
conditions

779
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,480
you'll get a much more accurate quick

780
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,039
way to root a plant

781
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,319
if you use that as your baseline to kind

782
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,720
of start

783
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,000
um if anybody's curious that's listening

784
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,640
to this i had about

785
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,319
2.5 microliters of iba and about 0.5

786
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,200
microliters or less of

787
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,079
naa that helps you out at all it took

788
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,480
about

789
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,960
anywhere from two weeks to four weeks to

790
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,880
actually see roots starting to form

791
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,240
so definitely not the fastest i've ever

792
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,240
seen in culture but

793
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,640
one of the fastest for cannabis

794
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,079
specifically

795
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,559
so forgive me again stupid question but

796
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,480
during this multiplication step there

797
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,440
are no roots being formed it's just

798
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,000
growing new stems and new shoots

799
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,880
i'd say that's a pretty fair way to say

800
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,119
it um

801
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,440
you're not growing any roots you're only

802
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,959
growing shoots because of the cytokinin

803
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,798
concentration

804
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,798
and again for anybody listening i would

805
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,839
go with uh 2ip

806
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,879
at about 2.5 microliters and i also add

807
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,599
naa at about

808
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,520
0.3 microliters and you're going to get

809
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,678
your best initiation multiplication

810
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:35,679
media that i found so far

811
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:39,038
so if that helps at all

812
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,559
okay so now we've gotten roots to form

813
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,480
um now we're putting them in soil

814
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,879
yep basically so you just pull them out

815
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,159
um i've used soil i've used rockwool

816
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,760
essentially what you just got to

817
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,360
remember is you're taking a plant that's

818
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,599
had pretty much 100

819
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,959
humidity and you're putting it in a

820
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,240
condition with

821
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,319
less than 50 humidity generally

822
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,079
so you really got to make sure to keep

823
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,519
that humidity level up close

824
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:07,759
to 80 or 90 percent for the first day

825
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,599
and then slowly taper it down hopefully

826
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,440
by the end of the week you can get it

827
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,079
back to about the climate that you look

828
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,840
for

829
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:17,839
sometimes it might take up to two weeks

830
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,839
on certain varieties

831
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,798
okay and so then once it's sort of

832
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,158
established it grows

833
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:29,440
as if it were sort of a seedling correct

834
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,840
seed or a clone yep either way but that

835
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,759
it's important to uh keep in mind right

836
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,678
when you pull it out of the tube it acts

837
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,879
a lot like an unrooted clone even if it

838
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,440
has roots

839
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,278
just because it's not used to that um

840
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,159
super low humidity on the top part of

841
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:47,440
the plant

842
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,240
so from initiation to

843
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,120
chopping it down and and processing it

844
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,880
how long

845
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:58,719
is that process um

846
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,760
that's a very interesting question so

847
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,960
you can get it down to under a month if

848
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,200
you have everything

849
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,038
set up lined up right whatever just to

850
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,558
get it into tissue culture and out of

851
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,839
tissue culture

852
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:11,519
but then you start with the plant

853
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,240
generally about the size of your thumb

854
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,319
or so

855
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,480
so a couple inches tall nothing too

856
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,558
crazy

857
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,720
the benefit of tissue culture in this

858
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:21,278
sense is that that initiation stage that

859
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,319
might take

860
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,079
two weeks to get you then have enough

861
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,558
tissue that you can constantly cut

862
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,480
25 more let's say or even seven or eight

863
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,119
more or something along those lines

864
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,120
depending on what blend you use it's

865
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,319
exponential propagation for

866
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,879
every two weeks you get let's say 25

867
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,000
more

868
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,360
five times in a row so you go from

869
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,919
something like um one cutting

870
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,678
to let's say ten cuttings those ten

871
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,600
cuttings turn into a hundred cuttings

872
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,360
two weeks later those hundred cuttings

873
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,678
turn into a thousand cuttings and you

874
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,398
can see how that just kind of explodes

875
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,960
um extremely quickly that's if you're

876
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,158
not accounting for loss or contamination

877
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,120
or anything else

878
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,080
if you have a perfect run and so it kind

879
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,719
of makes that

880
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,678
in that entry versus exit stage a little

881
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,120
bit trickier

882
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,798
because every time you do this you're

883
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,079
waiting at least another two weeks

884
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:17,278
before you can cut

885
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,558
and or change your media so

886
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,159
let's say you're at that thousand

887
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:21,599
cuttings and you've done all the

888
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,919
initiation all the

889
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,839
multiplication you just take all those

890
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,600
cuttings you change the media

891
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:31,759
to accommodate more of a rooting

892
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,278
which would mean you can up your thymine

893
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,558
levels you can change your

894
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,200
cytokinins into more of an auxin such as

895
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,440
iba

896
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,038
to really get it to root uh the same way

897
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,320
that if you took a cutting you dip it in

898
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,519
the rooting hormone

899
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:47,439
exact same concept so at that point

900
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,440
it's you have all the all these plants

901
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,278
that are in culture you now have dipped

902
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,640
them all in your rooting hormone

903
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,319
to keep this kind of easy to follow

904
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,399
along and now you

905
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,319
it takes you know anywhere from two to

906
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,000
four weeks to really start seeing roots

907
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,639
form on those plants

908
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and then once you see the roots you put

909
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,159
them in a container or

910
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,038
media whatever you would just like a

911
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,440
normal

912
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:09,440
clone

913
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,799
so how does

914
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,558
how does the number of plants you can

915
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:17,759
get out of a tissue culture sort of

916
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,798
compare to

917
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,558
taking cuttings from a mother um

918
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,079
do you get more from a tissue culture

919
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,359
more from a mother or is that sort of

920
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,918
not an easy question

921
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,398
there is no comparison tissue culture

922
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,720
you have

923
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,158
exponentially more every couple weeks

924
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,000
whereas a mother plant

925
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,600
you need to grow that out for roughly a

926
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,519
month or two to get

927
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:40,079
you know let's say if the mother plants

928
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,679
huge even a couple hundred cuttings off

929
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,439
it you can do that in tissue culture in

930
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,038
a fraction of the time

931
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,038
and if you're blend if you're mixing

932
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:47,440
your own media and you're not pre-buying

933
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,278
it in

934
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,200
stuff like that uh you can get your

935
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:55,038
media cost down to about one

936
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,640
to four cents a tube and so rather than

937
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,398
buying the clone cube which generally

938
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,360
would even cost like a quarter a piece

939
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,439
or something

940
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,199
you've dropped that down to three cents

941
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,038
a piece

942
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,880
making it so hard to even compare the

943
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:10,000
two tissue culture is

944
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,120
by far more efficient more effective

945
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and cheaper to do in the long term the

946
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,239
downside is

947
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,398
to set up a lab and to train somebody in

948
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,278
sterile technique and all that

949
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,158
can be a little bit of a pain i will

950
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,000
also mention

951
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,360
i have done tissue culture at my house

952
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,398
using my stove

953
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,918
to sterilize stuff and basically

954
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,918
doing it in the heat of the stove as

955
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,360
quickly as possible and still had decent

956
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,960
amounts of success

957
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,558
so even though i'm talking about this

958
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,759
like you know it's something you need a

959
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,440
lab and all this

960
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,000
if you just want to try it i mean you

961
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,000
can do it at your house as long as you

962
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
clean all your surfaces first and kind

963
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,398
of you know wipe down your counters and

964
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,519
make sure everything's somewhat sterile

965
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:54,158
if you're able to do it somewhat quickly

966
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,038
i can promise you based on my previous

967
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,120
experience

968
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,440
cultivating that i would not be able to

969
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,918
do that it's hard i'll say that but it's

970
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,919
not

971
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,120
it's not impossible and if you just want

972
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,600
to as i say try it

973
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,959
you can spend you know ten dollars and

974
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,119
even see if it's something that

975
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,759
interests you

976
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,918
now are there commercial growers that

977
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:17,038
are are using this method

978
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,240
um there are a few i don't know of many

979
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,798
that have it

980
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,919
as their full that's how they're doing

981
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,038
everything

982
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,600
just because it's

983
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,679
it's definitely a gamble every single

984
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,678
time you do it let's say

985
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,000
i was at a facility one time where the

986
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,960
roof above me kept getting flooded by

987
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,720
the growers above me at the time and my

988
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,519
contamination rates started to

989
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,159
exponentially increase it started out an

990
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,079
okay area to store my cultures

991
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,440
and by the end of it it just turned into

992
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,119
this uh

993
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,798
we'll call it a cesspool where every

994
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,518
single thing i was trying to do just got

995
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,679
contaminated like crazy

996
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,720
wow and what about outside of cannabis

997
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,919
are there other

998
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,519
crops or flowers that sort of use this

999
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:08,878
technique tons um pineapples

1000
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:12,639
grapes um i've done it with

1001
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:15,358
some orchids geraniums heuchera

1002
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,919
phlox i mean really you can do it with

1003
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,519
pretty much

1004
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,878
any plant you want to and your success

1005
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,320
is variable but

1006
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:26,639
yeah definitely but even on a commercial

1007
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,000
scale are they yeah totally um that's

1008
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,358
how a lot of orchids are actually

1009
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,440
staying alive

1010
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,199
some orchids they don't really like to

1011
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,320
propagate too much

1012
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,960
and you can't just germinate a seed it

1013
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,679
requires

1014
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,358
a special fungus in order for it to even

1015
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,519
germinate in the first place

1016
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,279
so they're finding um by using tissue

1017
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,800
culture you can actually just

1018
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,960
grow them like you normally would want

1019
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,919
to and that's one of the biggest

1020
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,559
benefits is

1021
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,559
just constant storage and recovery of

1022
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,878
genetics that are very hard to

1023
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,000
either grow from seed and or get enough

1024
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,679
cuttings of

1025
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,800
um the other example i'd have there is

1026
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,480
hucra i was uh doing a heuchera

1027
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,519
propagation in tissue culture at one

1028
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,880
point

1029
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,320
and in order to get four cuttings of

1030
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,760
heuchera you needed to grow the plant

1031
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,519
out for like a month

1032
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,960
versus if you wanted to do it in tissue

1033
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,400
culture you'd grow the plant out you

1034
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,720
take your four cuttings

1035
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,599
you'd try and get meristematic tissue

1036
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:21,838
and then

1037
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,519
from those four cuttings maybe two to

1038
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:24,239
three weeks later you could get another

1039
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,759
20.

1040
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,919
and so all of a sudden you weren't

1041
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,520
waiting like crazy just to get the

1042
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,838
couple few cuttings that you actually

1043
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,838
wanted

1044
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,519
so one of the things that you touched on

1045
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,679
i think when you were talking about

1046
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,400
orchids was this idea of germinating

1047
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,039
seeds

1048
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,480
in a culture medium which you had

1049
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,159
mentioned before too and said you were

1050
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,159
going to get back to you so i wanted to

1051
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,920
make sure i brought that up uh totally

1052
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:48,879
actually there's two parts to that

1053
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,519
there's one called

1054
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,400
green pod sewing um and then there's

1055
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,480
actual just

1056
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,119
seed germination and green pod sewing is

1057
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,440
you take an

1058
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,599
immature seed which just hasn't

1059
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,760
developed the entire seed coat

1060
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,640
but does have a live embryo in the

1061
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,720
middle

1062
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,480
and you basically cut out the embryo

1063
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,519
drop it in your culture media

1064
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,519
and grow it just like that because your

1065
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,440
culture media has all the nutrients

1066
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,159
hormones and vitamins the plant needs to

1067
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,320
grow

1068
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,319
it's essentially exactly what the seed

1069
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,559
coat would provide which is all the

1070
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,320
nutrients hormones and vitamins in order

1071
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,440
for the plant to even germinate and

1072
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,880
start producing

1073
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,559
the correct tissues in the correct spots

1074
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,000
one of the interesting experiments i

1075
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,559
actually did when i was doing seed

1076
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,760
germination on cannabis specifically

1077
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:40,239
was i took uh 2 4d which is an actual

1078
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,839
herbicide or a synthetic oxen depending

1079
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,919
on your concentration

1080
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,838
and i added it to my culture media just

1081
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,838
to see what would happen

1082
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,358
i actually grew the seeds upside down so

1083
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,440
the roots were in the air and the shoots

1084
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,440
started growing into the media

1085
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,358
because it was a non-polar oxen i

1086
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,559
figured out meaning and didn't know

1087
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:00,159
up from down um found that kind of

1088
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,119
interesting when i was doing it i've

1089
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:06,879
never seen it before

1090
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,680
wow so being able to take the embryo out

1091
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,920
before

1092
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,759
it forms that seed coat what are some of

1093
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,320
the advantages of doing it that way

1094
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,400
um the big one that i would see is

1095
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,280
mostly for breeding purposes

1096
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,639
instead of having to grow your plant for

1097
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,359
that entire

1098
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,199
let's say 60 days or whatever it would

1099
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,960
generally take to get your seed

1100
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,719
you can cut that time down as soon as

1101
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,119
the pollen hits it you wait let's say a

1102
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,279
week

1103
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,039
a week and a half and you should be able

1104
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,000
to cut those seeds straight out put them

1105
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:35,519
in your media

1106
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,679
and actually get them to grow because

1107
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:41,039
the embryos formed without the seed coat

1108
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,719
at that point wow so that could

1109
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,159
that could significantly accelerate your

1110
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,439
program yeah you could cut

1111
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,399
months out of each cycle and in that

1112
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,838
case you could do

1113
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,519
if especially if you're pulling them

1114
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:52,320
straight out of culture and flowering

1115
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,719
them

1116
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,480
um or i've also seen people develop

1117
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,679
pollen sacks and or flowers

1118
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,519
in culture you can reduce your you know

1119
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,679
let's say three month four month grow

1120
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,079
time down to a

1121
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,719
three to four week grow time which you

1122
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,920
can see the advantages there

1123
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,078
wow absolutely one other thing that

1124
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,079
you did touch on in your presentation

1125
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,039
that i wanted to ask you about was this

1126
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,200
idea of dark

1127
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,719
rooting and you shared an interesting

1128
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,439
story about how you kind of came up with

1129
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,439
the idea

1130
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,639
so hoping you can maybe retell that

1131
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,880
story and

1132
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:31,598
tell people about it yeah sure so

1133
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,559
i i actually ran across this by accident

1134
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,800
completely

1135
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:37,119
um i had cut down some plants one day

1136
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,720
that we just decided

1137
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,480
you know they were in vegetative growth

1138
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,679
phase they were not in flowering at the

1139
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,000
time

1140
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,598
but we just didn't want the plants they

1141
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,199
were just extra they might have been

1142
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,720
male i don't exactly remember the

1143
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,639
circumstance

1144
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,639
but i cut them way down low right next

1145
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,598
to the um where the root system would

1146
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,279
start

1147
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,599
and there were all these little white

1148
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,359
dots at the bottom of the plant i'm sure

1149
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,720
you know people have seen these before

1150
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:02,880
you don't really think anything of it

1151
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,279
it's just a lot of light little

1152
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,480
things on the stem and you know it's

1153
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,680
part of the plant so

1154
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,480
not an issue i took that plant shoved it

1155
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:14,799
in a black 55-gallon trash bag

1156
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,400
and got carried away with some other

1157
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,599
project i can't remember what it was

1158
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,079
doesn't matter

1159
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,519
um long story short is they sat in the

1160
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,480
corner of a grow room for

1161
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,838
about a week maybe a week and a half and

1162
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,440
i went back there

1163
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,199
just to stay compliant get them out of

1164
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,039
the way

1165
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,719
and i decided to open the bag just to

1166
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,559
see you know does it smell

1167
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:35,838
funny is something rotting in here

1168
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,000
what's going on

1169
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,239
and right when i opened it i saw new

1170
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,159
little root hairs uh protruding out

1171
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,239
of the bottom it would it would be

1172
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,799
considered a callus growth

1173
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,719
at that point of the plant so right

1174
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,720
where all those little dots are way down

1175
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,559
low right next to your root ball

1176
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,319
where the water continues to rise and

1177
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,920
lower and rise and lower that sort of

1178
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,640
stuff

1179
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,838
i saw maybe centimeter long roots coming

1180
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,159
out

1181
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,199
and the fact that that happened without

1182
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,279
the plants having

1183
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,039
any light whatsoever no water no

1184
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,119
nutrients all i did was keep the

1185
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,960
humidity up like crazy

1186
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,559
and the plant just naturally wanted to

1187
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,679
throw out roots right there

1188
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,960
i decided well if that works outside of

1189
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,000
tissue culture

1190
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,480
why not try it in tissue culture i had

1191
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,358
some experience with other hard to root

1192
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,358
plants

1193
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,559
and growing them in the dark for the

1194
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:28,960
first week or so

1195
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,880
in order to get those uh the top tissue

1196
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,880
to not die off and the roots would start

1197
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,240
to push a little bit quicker

1198
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,720
so i gave it a shot on cannabis and

1199
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:41,199
it did work um i don't want to say it

1200
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:44,159
was hugely successful because

1201
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,039
i saw quite a few issues such as the

1202
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,759
roots didn't

1203
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,039
always grow down they lost that polarity

1204
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,720
because i'm guessing the

1205
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,480
light has something to do with knowing

1206
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,799
which direction to travel

1207
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,760
polarity-wise and i actually know that

1208
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,400
for a fact

1209
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,680
it's a common thing you learn in plant

1210
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,838
physiology

1211
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,759
where a long time ago to determine oxens

1212
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,599
they took a candle up to a plant

1213
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,079
and they saw which direction the stem

1214
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,480
would lean and

1215
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,000
the experiment essentially taught them

1216
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,719
what an oxen was

1217
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,239
and how to or that it would break down

1218
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,559
under light

1219
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,358
so when you're oxen your rooting hormone

1220
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,519
essentially

1221
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,119
breaks down under light you're going to

1222
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,880
have less of it naturally

1223
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,800
that's why you see a lot of people to

1224
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,519
start to add charcoal into their rooting

1225
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,599
media

1226
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,679
and the charcoal is actually mostly a

1227
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,599
way to prevent

1228
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,838
light from hitting your your plant

1229
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,480
tissues and prevent something called

1230
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,920
phenolic

1231
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,838
exudation which is i like to think of it

1232
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,280
as the plants doing chemical warfare and

1233
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,838
trying to suffocate or kill

1234
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,560
any other plants or funguses or whatever

1235
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,358
around it

1236
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,199
by excreting toxic chemicals the only

1237
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:53,440
problem is if it's growing in its own

1238
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,039
tube by itself those toxic chemicals

1239
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,679
come back to

1240
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,679
kill it off

1241
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,318
so rooting in the dark the entire point

1242
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,639
of this for me

1243
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,719
was i saw an application with tissue

1244
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:07,679
culture and being able to ship these

1245
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,879
cultures

1246
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:13,358
in a sealed enclosed sterile environment

1247
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,400
in the mail where they could get knocked

1248
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,239
around quite a bit

1249
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,519
and you know you could chuck the package

1250
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,679
or whatever and you wouldn't

1251
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,039
lose your culture the plant wouldn't die

1252
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,318
so by the time it got from

1253
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,318
point a to its destination at point b um

1254
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:27,440
you stood you still had a healthy plant

1255
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,279
that was alive

1256
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,960
and if you had just done those cultures

1257
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,119
and shipped it they would

1258
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,880
have either just started to root or be

1259
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,079
fully rooted by the time they reached

1260
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,119
their destination

1261
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:42,640
without even using priority mail wow

1262
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,440
well that would be an interesting

1263
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:48,480
application for sure exactly so

1264
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,079
you know why why take all this time to

1265
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,240
try and ship a clone dome

1266
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,119
that's all you need it lit and you need

1267
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,118
to worry about

1268
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,960
all your cuttings inside not having an

1269
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,800
insect on them or anything else

1270
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,079
you're already sterile all you do is

1271
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,200
throw it in the mail

1272
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,119
and this is actually kind of tying into

1273
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,559
automation of tissue culture if you

1274
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,838
don't mind talking about that for a

1275
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,480
minute

1276
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,440
no not at all okay so one of the big

1277
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,199
things was

1278
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
if you try and ship all these you'd

1279
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,000
obviously want to automate your process

1280
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,159
so

1281
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,559
you could just mass ship and you could

1282
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,399
have one company or one project

1283
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,318
where all you're focused on instead of

1284
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,280
taking mother plants and all that

1285
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,279
is growing out small plants amassing

1286
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,040
them in tissue culture using stage two

1287
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,560
that multiplication stage

1288
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:35,519
and then shipping them off to other

1289
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,920
people and at their facilities they can

1290
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:41,280
harden them off and do things like that

1291
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,200
um which would mean there's certain um

1292
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,560
things i've seen such as media pouring

1293
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,598
applications which

1294
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:50,559
take and pump media in let's say eight

1295
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,079
cells wide by 20 cells long or something

1296
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:55,599
along those lines

1297
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,039
and you can then seal it up with a piece

1298
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,559
of um

1299
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:02,480
saran wrap or vacuum sealed whatever you

1300
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,159
want to call it just a clear plastic

1301
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,318
film on the top

1302
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,679
and from that point it's sterile you can

1303
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,480
ship them without

1304
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,118
any really big human inputs you'd have a

1305
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,440
machine

1306
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,160
with a robot arm go and take your

1307
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,920
cuttings

1308
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,000
and place them in your culture media

1309
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,838
themselves you'd have a machine that

1310
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,519
filled all your culture media

1311
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:26,239
and sealed everything um after the

1312
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:26,800
robot arm when stuck all the cultures

1313
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,000
and then

1314
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,240
ship them off and this is actually um

1315
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,280
i've started at this company uh olsen's

1316
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,159
greenhouse

1317
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,640
and they're one of the largest in the

1318
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:37,838
u.s

1319
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,920
currently i think they're the 10th

1320
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,159
largest right now and i'm actually

1321
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,920
running their propagation department

1322
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,838
and the application i could see for

1323
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,200
tissue culture in the cannabis industry

1324
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,279
is fairly similar

1325
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,799
you have a device called a boom a

1326
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,119
watering boom which is

1327
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,000
just mist nozzles that have such a fine

1328
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,200
mist

1329
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,440
they keep the humidity up on your plants

1330
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,399
so if we were to let's say buy in tissue

1331
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,599
culture

1332
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,440
and keep these boom mist nozzles running

1333
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,559
over the plants every five minutes to

1334
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,720
start with

1335
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,358
we could actually pull the plants from

1336
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,279
the in vitro cultured vessels

1337
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,400
stick them in the plug trays or whatever

1338
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,119
we wanted to use

1339
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,400
our maybe two and a half inch pots or

1340
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,960
three inch pots

1341
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,000
and just keep them alive with the mist

1342
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,679
in order to

1343
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,519
fully grow the plants and harden them

1344
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:29,039
off all at the same time

1345
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:31,599
so it cuts down on a ton of

1346
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,079
taking the cuttings having mom plants

1347
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,680
around

1348
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,119
worrying about all the pathogens that

1349
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:37,519
come along with that

1350
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,119
and allow the allow companies to just

1351
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:41,039
buy in their cultures straight

1352
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,039
buying their plants straight have a

1353
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,079
consistent type

1354
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,599
know their insect and pathogen-free if

1355
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,519
you know the companies doing meristem

1356
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,079
culture you can also guarantee virus

1357
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:52,639
free

1358
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,079
especially if they're testing um and

1359
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,159
again i'm gonna mention

1360
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,560
that the assays that you guys are doing

1361
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,000
i that is huge i didn't realize you were

1362
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,039
doing that until today

1363
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,358
and so yeah i would highly recommend

1364
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,159
talking to tissue culture growers on

1365
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,000
that i could see a huge application for

1366
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,480
all the different virus tests that you

1367
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,119
would perform

1368
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,800
wow that sounds that sounds amazing

1369
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,838
actually the idea of

1370
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,318
um cultivators sort of just getting a a

1371
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,078
flat

1372
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:23,759
of all these tissue cultures and then

1373
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,680
kind of putting them underneath the mist

1374
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,839
hardening them off and then

1375
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,199
then you're off to the races that would

1376
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,679
certainly be

1377
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,480
quite the operation yeah the advantage

1378
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,000
of that over

1379
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,159
clone domes because i know a lot of

1380
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,838
people especially probably listening

1381
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:40,719
really like clone domes

1382
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:42,000
you tend to have stagnant air which can

1383
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,639
develop more pathogen

1384
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,079
issues on your tissue things like that

1385
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,000
versus a mist bench

1386
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,839
or a mist system which would essentially

1387
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,440
lay water on the tissue and then let it

1388
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,639
dry out preventing

1389
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:00,079
huge pathogen buildups over time

1390
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:03,118
for the most part yeah and i guess

1391
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,839
that's a an interesting question so

1392
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,280
are these plants any more susceptible to

1393
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:08,960
contamination than

1394
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,560
you know a plant that was grown right

1395
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,559
from seed um

1396
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:17,199
i don't think so a lot of it is genetic

1397
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,000
variety dependent

1398
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,879
so some call them strains are going to

1399
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,599
be different than

1400
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,920
other strains and the insects they draw

1401
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:29,519
the pathogens they get

1402
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,318
things like that and so

1403
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,119
yeah i with a seed you can still have a

1404
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:35,599
bacteria

1405
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,200
or a virus inside the seed coat itself

1406
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,160
in the embryo itself

1407
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,318
before you even germinate it so tissue

1408
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:45,838
culture is probably a better method

1409
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:49,440
actually to ensure virus

1410
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:52,480
pathogen and insect free plants

1411
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,240
all right that's the goal um i do want

1412
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,880
to be mindful of your time i could

1413
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,519
i could talk about this for seemingly

1414
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,680
all day

1415
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:00,719
um but i did want to be mindful of your

1416
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,118
time and

1417
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,039
before i let you go i wanted to give you

1418
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,680
an opportunity to

1419
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:10,318
plug the company that you're working for

1420
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,799
any social media or anything

1421
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,400
now is your time um yeah sure so

1422
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,920
currently i'm working for

1423
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,400
one of the largest greenhouses in

1424
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,079
colorado olson's greenhouse

1425
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,240
right now they're cultivating plants

1426
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,079
mostly for walmart and home depot

1427
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,799
so not really doing a whole lot with

1428
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:29,599
cannabis per se

1429
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,119

1435
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:44,159
a while but

1436
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:47,358
