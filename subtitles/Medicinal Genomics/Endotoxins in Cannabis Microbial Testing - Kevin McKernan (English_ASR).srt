1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,599
um so I'm going to be talking about a

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,559
bit of a uh tragedy and a controversy

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:15,359
today and I need to First figure out how

4
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:17,399
to work this remote there we go um so we

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,038
went down this Rabbit Hole uh it's very

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,559
interesting Rabbit Hole it may be

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,599
playing a role in a fatality we had in

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,479
the state of Massachusetts um so

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,480
whenever something as complicated and

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,039
tragic as that happens I think it's very

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,039
important for us to just get all of our

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,239
conflicts on the table uh many people in

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,839
this audience know that medicinal

14
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,199
genomics and canmet are are same

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,640
organization um don't know why that's

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,760
jumping ahead on me let see if I can go

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,439
back one

18
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,119
um mainly for the folks on camera here

19
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,039
if this is recorded that's not always

20
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,399
known that the canmed team is part of

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,198
the medical jics team and they do a

22
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,840
wonderful job running our marketing and

23
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,399
making this event happen every year but

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,519
this event is managed uh on a on a break

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,039
even basis and that we try to even every

26
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,319
year we sometimes fail and when we fail

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,478
the medal genomics marketing uh budget

28
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,199
picks up the rest but we have a lot of

29
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:11,719
sponsors as a result of this um and

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,799
we've done this seven years now so we've

31
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:15,280
been sponsored by many many parties in

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,680
the industry but I want to assure you

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,400
that this presentation none of these

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,320
sponsors actually played a role in what

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm going to present but I am going to

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,239
be presenting you some uh some

37
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,280
quantitative PCR data and we do make

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,959
quantitative PCR kits that um we're

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,159
using to try to shed a little bit more

40
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,199
light on this question

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,000
okay so so what are endotoxins and why

42
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,560
do we care um well we think this is

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,879
still a very you know hypo hypothetical

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,680
level here we think these may have

45
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,158
played a role in this person's asthmatic

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,719
attack um so we put out a pre-print

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,439
describing this I'll give you a bit of a

48
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:49,239
background on what endotoxins are but

49
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,239
this is an area that we effectively have

50
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,879
not looked at and I've been looking at

51
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,640
cannabis safety testing since 2011 no

52
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,759
one's really brought this up we were

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,478
looking at mot toxins which makes sense

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,359
we're not looking at all the mot toxins

55
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,560
that we probably should be looking at I

56
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,679
think zumir Puna and others have pointed

57
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,519
out there's a lot of fusarium and

58
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,439
penicilium on the species which make mot

59
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,639
toxins and uh those aren't being looked

60
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,318
at um but endotoxin is something that

61
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,000
has gone overlooked largely and it's

62
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,119
quite ubiquitous it is a it's only found

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,719
on gram negative bacteria and uh this is

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,200
really a molecule a lipopolysaccharide

65
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,759
that embeds inside of a cell membrane

66
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,439
and has an inner cord an outer cord and

67
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,280
an O antigen and many of you may be

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,039
familiar with serotyping particular

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,840
bacteria a lot of that stereotyping is

70
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,479
based on antibodies that that bind to

71
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,759
the difference in the length of these o

72
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,479
antigens okay however these are highly

73
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,318
inflammatory molecules you cannot have

74
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,119
these in any injectable product in fact

75
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,000
they can give you anaphylaxis and have

76
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,200
you drop like on the spot after a

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,919
vaccine for example if they're in a uh a

78
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,238
vaccine at too high of a level so

79
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,039
injectable products are highly

80
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,080
scrutinized to be below one endot

81
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:57,318
endotoxin unit per uh you know

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
particular dose or weight um there is

83
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:01,158
also a standard we'll touch on a little

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,959
bit later for air born endotoxin how

85
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:04,280
much of that is tolerable and a lot of

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,000
that is based in the fact that these

87
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,039
molecules are known um to induce asthma

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,560
so there have been some studies of um

89
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,318
how much gram negative bacteria is

90
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,199
actually on cannabis uh there's a great

91
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,079
study from bright green here and he's

92
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,280
coming up with the estimate around 40%

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,000
of the bacteria on cannabis are gram

94
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,039
negative and potentially endotoxin

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,719
producing uh so this is the first that

96
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,840
we saw this is has shocked us a little

97
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,959
bit so we asked our biomatics team can

98
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,360
you go and dig into our database and see

99
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,120
if this holds up uh so at medicinal

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,879
genomics we most of our clients now who

101
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,080
do sequence genomes have been switching

102
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:41,679
from doing exome capture sequencing to

103
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,159
just doing whole genome sequencing

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
because it's cheaper and when you do

105
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:47,120
whole genome sequencing you get the

106
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,239
whole microbiome with it so it's a two

107
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,959
for one uh and we've now done this in

108
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,079
close to a thousand samples and we have

109
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,039
microbiomes from flower from root from

110
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,239
Leaf from stem and a whole bunch that

111
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,000
are unknown because some people just

112
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,319
send us in DNA and we don't always know

113
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,158
the source

114
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,000
um but with this data we can dig into

115
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,840
the data and sort of ask a lot of these

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,598
regulatory questions like what is the

117
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,479
prevalence of certain microbes on

118
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,000
cannabis um and when you do some

119
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,598
sequencing like this here's here's an

120
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,598
example of some DNA from Roots that's

121
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,798
zir pja sent in and in this case we got

122
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,680
about 11% of the reads are microbiome

123
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,439
reads and 89% are cannabis uh usually

124
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,280
with roots around 10 to 20% of the reads

125
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,600
come back as a microbiome when you get

126
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,839
to the stems it's more like 10% when you

127
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,720
get to the flowers it's more like 5%

128
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,959
when you get to leaves it's more like 1%

129
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,240
there's very little microbiome on on the

130
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,839
leaves maybe powdery Milo samples would

131
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,600
be a little bit different um we haven't

132
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,439
sequenced many of those but um

133
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,759
nevertheless you can get a good profile

134
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,879
of what is uh what what is on these

135
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,080
plants um by just doing whole genome

136
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,959
sequencing and looking what comes

137
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:54,639
through now when you do this and you go

138
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:56,279
through this these 959 whole genomes you

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,439
can see that the predominant species in

140
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,918
on cannabis across all jurisdictions is

141
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,478
camonis uh which is in fact gram

142
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,799
negative uh billus is next in line which

143
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:07,359
is gram positive now Gram Gram positives

144
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,720
are very interesting particularly pillus

145
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,280
because many people use those as

146
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,400
biocontrol agents that can push

147
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:16,959
asparagus out of the plant and can uh

148
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:19,079
even in some cases um push the gram um

149
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,758
the gram negatives out of the plant so

150
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,079
um for those who are making these types

151
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,800
of biocontrol Agents I'm hoping this

152
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:26,318
presentation will encourage you to get

153
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,478
rid of the gram negatives and use the

154
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,680
gram positives because um this would

155
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,639
lower potentially the endotoxin numbers

156
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,439
that are out there but you can see by

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,680
the numbers on the right hand side here

158
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,000
that yes there are a large number of

159
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,319
these in this case perhaps 60% of the of

160
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,079
the samples have camonis in them uh so

161
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,680
there are gram negative bacteria uh

162
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,800
quite frequently found even in the

163
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,120
sequencing data that uh that we find

164
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,240
here um now the reasons why these in

165
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,680
fact May differ a little bit uh is

166
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,000
because we're doing whole genome

167
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,519
sequencing and other studies may have

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,759
looked at what can culture out of these

169
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,279
things and so we will get different

170
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,720
results we will see sequence everything

171
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,799
but not everything will cultured at the

172
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,800
same rate so we don't expect them to be

173
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,560
exactly the same okay so here's the um

174
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,199
the fatality that occurred um there was

175
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,399
a 27-year-old employee Laura McMurray

176
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,478
who was in a trimming facility in

177
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,279
Massachusetts she had an asmatic attack

178
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:20,159
on the job and and and sadly suffered

179
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,959
fatal consequences um she was a cannabis

180
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
user so everyone was confused by this

181
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,279
like she clearly has been around the

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,960
plant before was not suffering uh so

183
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:34,159
what changed what made this fatal event

184
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,959
occur now the a lot of pitchforks came

185
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,880
out in the industry about the employer

186
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,758
and not having masks and all this stuff

187
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,879
but uh when I've kind of tried to

188
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,639
neutrally look at this I encourage

189
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,478
everyone to put the pitchforks down we

190
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,598
need to solve this uh and and to get

191
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,079
objective about this and sober about

192
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:53,000
this I think we should put all the

193
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,839
finger pointing away uh the the employer

194
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,399
instantly put a new HVAC uh before any

195
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,038
regulation came in place or any

196
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:03,279
regulator showed up and uh if if you dig

197
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:05,318
into PPE OSHA and Nash standards that

198
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,079
was the right call uh when you do not

199
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,720
know what the hazard is you can't mask

200
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,959
your way out of this uh and a lot of

201
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,479
people were accusing employer of not

202
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,239
having enough masks but the masks

203
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:16,959
frankly don't work for for for a hazard

204
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,840
that you don't know what it is um so the

205
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,318
CDC did play pay visit um they came in

206
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,598
and tested for all types of Airborne

207
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,879
hazards but we took note that they

208
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,240
looked at endotoxins um and that's not

209
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,280
something the Cannabis industry usually

210
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,680
looks for so that was very intriguing to

211
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:35,439
us and OA got involved as well um so why

212
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,038
is h factor right play here well if you

213
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,759
Megan Manel has a great book on uh on

214
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,839
all the mask Madness that happened

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,919
during the pandemic and how these masks

216
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,000
really weren't fit for purpose she's a

217
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:49,198
nios and an OSHA expert that does PPE

218
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
but I think the real takeaway from this

219
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,759
is they have a they have a logic tree

220
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,759
there of a hierarchy of controls and

221
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,400
when you're not certain what the actual

222
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,759
environmental hazard is you cannot PP

223
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,638
your way out of it you start with

224
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,680
elimination the top of this tree you try

225
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,720
to get rid of or clean the air you don't

226
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,478
try to put porous masks on people's face

227
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,120
that aren't sealed because you don't

228
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:12,360
know what's going to get through those

229
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,199
masks so um HVAC is the right way to go

230
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,639
HVAC was not easy to do at this time

231
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,199
this occurred during the pandemic and no

232
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,960
one could get agac during the pandemic

233
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,759
because it was backlogged for um for

234
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,680
many

235
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,080
hospitals okay so there is now an mmwr

236
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,120
at the CDC on this fatal occupational

237
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,240
hazard in cannabis grows um CDC has

238
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,200
helicoptered in and and written up this

239
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,399
report um now an important aspect of

240
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,440
this report is that they now when they

241
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,719
went into this grow after the HVAC was

242
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,360
put in and measured it there the

243
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,039
endotoxin levels were safe they were

244
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,759
below the decost limits but that was

245
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,838
probably because they put in new HVAC

246
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,600
they did not get to sample this during

247
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,720
the event so we don't know what was

248
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,040
happening while the patient uh was

249
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,278
suffering but they did note that when

250
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,399
they have looked at this in other grows

251
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,720
40% of the employees are exposed to

252
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,559
endotoxin levels that exceed these D

253
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,600
cost limits all right so this is a a

254
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,639
hazard in a trimming environment that I

255
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,759
don't think anyone in the industry was

256
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,399
really paying attention to we're were

257
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,838
paying attention to patients and not

258
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,200
really thinking about okay what about

259
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,160
people in trimming environments that are

260
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,839
getting large amounts of this uh of this

261
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:17,240
dust um why we care in this case is

262
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,360
there's lots of literature from the

263
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,919
tobacco industry showing these endotoxin

264
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,079
exposures are in a risk for asthmatics

265
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,439
uh she had asthma so this is something

266
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:28,919
that uh could have triggered her asmatic

267
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,480
uh reaction to this um and it seems to

268
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,120
make a lot more sense than perhaps total

269
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,039
yeast and mold or other things because

270
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,679
we know in Massachusetts those grows

271
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,559
were regulated to at least produce

272
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:40,799
cannabis that was below particular yeast

273
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,838
and mold threshold so uh it would make a

274
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,719
little bit more sense to look at the

275
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,480
things that we're not testing for when

276
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,519
we're trying to assess um what's going

277
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,320
on here um the decost limits come out of

278
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,720
um come out of the Netherlands they're

279
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,920
90 endotoxin units per cubic meter of

280
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,040
air a cubic meter of air is a big space

281
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,199
you have to think of that as being about

282
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,759
a million MLS or maybe a million grams

283
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,839
um and I'm going to show you some data

284
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,600
of endotoxin levels on cannabis that are

285
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,560
thousands of times higher than this

286
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,320
which is a little bit shocking at the

287
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,319
moment um these can also be a concern

288
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,360
for people who do are not asthmatics

289
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,560
which is paper on the left sadly I think

290
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,639
might be getting cut off a little bit on

291
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,559
my picture here um is uh we'll show you

292
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,399
what types of clinical implications

293
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,199
these endotoxins can have from an

294
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,399
inhalation

295
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,920
standpoint now this is not the first

296
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,559
time this has been seen um James couch

297
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,000
has been looking at these types of

298
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,599
Occupational exposures in other cannabis

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,440
cultivation and processing facilities

300
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,320
and it has endotoxins have been brought

301
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,519
up in both of these papers um there's a

302
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,278
nios review there and another um review

303
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,720
of a hemp processing facility in

304
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:49,799
Minnesota where they we detecting very

305
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,079
high levels of of endotoxins so um this

306
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:55,000
is beginning to build a little momentum

307
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:58,319
so we decided uh we would go purchase a

308
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,919
$6,000 fluorometer from Thermo and uh

309
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,839
and and run their endotoxin test on some

310
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,399
cannabis samples um this is using a l

311
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,000
assay this is a an assay that uses an

312
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,240
enzyme that's harvested out of horseshoe

313
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,078
crab blood and it clots whenever there's

314
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,440
endotoxin and it measures that clotting

315
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:14,919
reaction with fluoresence um now there's

316
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,160
a standard curve that you have to run

317
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:20,039
with this and you will notice if you

318
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,958
take a gram of sample of cannabis put it

319
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,159
in 10 MLS of water and then put just

320
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,439
five microliters of that into this

321
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,559
machine you will be off curve high on

322
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,079
standard if you put a half a micr in

323
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,679
you'll be off curve high in the standard

324
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,599
you have to get all the way down to like

325
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:37,919
50 Nan to 5 Nan to actually be in range

326
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,879
on this machine which is telling us that

327
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,599
this cannabis samples are in the

328
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,759
thousands to hundreds of thousands of

329
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,560
endotoxin units per gram um which is

330
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,240
remarkably High uh so high that I really

331
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,958
want to encourage the industry to

332
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,759
actually double check this technology

333
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,719
maybe with mass spec or something else

334
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:57,360
because if you go through the endotoxin

335
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,079
literature uh these lassay are very

336
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,800
temperamental based on the Matrix that

337
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:02,399
they're are implied in and you do have

338
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,159
to run this in Matrix so you have to

339
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,919
dilute your sample and do lots of

340
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,480
standard um curves and dilutions to make

341
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,240
sure that the Matrix isn't inhibiting

342
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,959
your your actual endotoxin reaction so

343
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,879
we just started very simply we went and

344
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,958
grabbed a hemp sample a pre-roll in in

345
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,799
cal um in in Massachusetts they are not

346
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,439
required to do microbial testing as you

347
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,078
can see and you go to the dispensary

348
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,240
pre-rolls and you can see that they are

349
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,599
required to do microbial testing when

350
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,399
you put this on three imp plates you get

351
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,079
night and day differences however these

352
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,360
samples had equivalent endotoxin un

353
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:36,039
uh we also ran um you know Tac uh qpcr

354
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,759
and and um you can see very similar

355
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:40,000
effects so for those not familiar with

356
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,399
3m lots of blue dots means lots of live

357
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,759
colonies uh if you look at the

358
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,919
dispensary sample those colonies have

359
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,600
all been Zapped uh probably probably

360
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,439
radiated but we don't know in

361
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,560
Massachusetts there is no requirement to

362
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,399
label any type of

363
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,319
remediation um so we said all right

364
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,958
that's interesting uh we have to expand

365
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,480
this let's do 12 more samples we went

366
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,439
and grabbed um a bunch of non-

367
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,440
dispensary samples labeled as ND they

368
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,040
are on the right in this bar chart and

369
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
then a bunch of dispensary samples which

370
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,679
are on the left the blue bars that

371
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,559
you're looking at there are the

372
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,399
endotoxin units detected off the

373
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,518
platform uh you can see that they're

374
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,000
ring you know they're ranging between

375
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,639
maybe 5,000 and 100,000 and as you get

376
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,278
more to The non-d Dispensary samples the

377
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,639
endotoxin levels get a little higher

378
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,600
they push up to over 100,000 it's it's a

379
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,320
log scale we're dealing with there now

380
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,680
the orange and gray lines are something

381
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,760
that we're doing to try to get a

382
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:31,000
surrogate detection system for this with

383
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:33,159
qpcr we run quantitative PCR with 16s um

384
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,078
uh PCR primers those are total aerobic

385
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,879
count PCR primers they measure all

386
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:39,319
bacteria we measure it two different

387
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,278
ways we measure it with a in the

388
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,480
presence of a nuclease in the presence

389
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,679
without a nucleas and this gives us a

390
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,320
live dead estimate so the nucleas runs

391
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,799
around and choose up DNA that's outside

392
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,639
of a cell and any DNA that's inside of a

393
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,639
cell is protected from the nucleus so we

394
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,959
can get an estimate of total DNA that's

395
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,600
present in the sample and then DNA that

396
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,799
is protected by a cell membrane with

397
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,440
this type of Liv dead and you can see in

398
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,519
some cases there are in fact the live

399
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,199
dead offset is quite significant and in

400
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,679
the case of the two samples on the left

401
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:11,838
we have lots of uh 16s qpcr signal and

402
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,319
then once we apply a nuclease all that

403
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,480
stuff disappears and we get samples that

404
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,000
look a lot more like the plating results

405
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,039
but there are samples where the nucleus

406
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,440
doesn't get rid of all of this um in

407
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,759
fact Jenny Glaros gave a great

408
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,199
presentation last year on this topic uh

409
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,199
with uh decontamination tools uh using

410
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,958
radiation and uh the radiation does seem

411
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,039
drop the signal uh or the cfu counts

412
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,599
almost to the floor whereas qpcr

413
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,559
sometimes is still there in some samples

414
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,920
you can still detect it with qpcr even

415
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,479
though it's clearly been killed from a

416
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:43,159
viability standpoint uh nevertheless

417
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,399
there is some correlation here between

418
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,278
the live dead PCR signal and the

419
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,759
endotoxin levels but it's not great it's

420
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,720
like0 43 so we can't really use this as

421
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,600
a replacement for measuring endotoxins

422
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,000
yet so we we aim to try to improve that

423
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,040
we picked up a paper from biso that made

424
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,278
it was a qpcr assay trying to discern

425
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,319
gram positive from gramam negative uh D

426
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,360
if if you recall the PCR system we were

427
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,800
using before looked at all bacteria and

428
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
maybe that's confusing the signal we

429
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,198
should just look at bacteria that's gram

430
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,519
negative and correlate that with the

431
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,319
endotoxin number so we modified this

432
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,360
thing to work with our particular dieses

433
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,360
and moved on and started measuring how

434
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,159
specific it was so if you put in a gram

435
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,120
negative sample into this assay uh

436
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,919
you'll see the gram the gram positive

437
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,720
signals come out in Blue on fam and the

438
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:29,958
gram negatives come out in sci five and

439
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,440
we get about a 15 CT offet set between

440
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,198
that on something that's known gam

441
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,880
negative if you put in billus which is

442
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,599
gr positive you get the opposite

443
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,399
reaction that occurs you get more blue

444
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,360
signal than purple signal and it's about

445
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,039
a 15 CT offset that's about a 32,000

446
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,480
fold discrimination between gram

447
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,599
positive and gram negative with qpcr

448
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,839
that's all we need that should be good

449
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,639
enough to to sort this out so we started

450
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,279
running these Solutions and endotoxins

451
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,919
to get a better estimation of whether

452
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,919
qpcr can guide this process or not um

453
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,039
you can see many of these l assays in

454
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,240
there are bright green to your eye you

455
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,360
can almost tell which ones are going to

456
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,039
be off chart High just by looking at

457
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,639
them and the standard curve is way out

458
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,318
there and back um and again this is the

459
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,560
uh you know 5 microliters all the way

460
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:13,000
down to 5 nanoliters of um serial

461
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,439
dilution going into these things and

462
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,120
there's still you can still see very

463
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,600
Vivid color changes that are you know

464
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,159
almost breaking the standard curve there

465
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,360
and back um so here's just a couple

466
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,879
examples where we've done this on uh

467
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,720
sample here's sample 8 and Sample five

468
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,958
you can see there's clearly a lot more

469
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,120
Gram Gram negative DNA in purple there

470
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,758
there on Sample 8 coming out at a CT

471
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,159
around 15 and then you can see that the

472
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,919
gram um the gram positive signal is just

473
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,318
behind it and Sample five is shifted

474
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,799
almost entirely over so that there's

475
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:45,039
much lower amounts of uh of gram

476
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,479
negative versus gram positive and when

477
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,480
we look at the endotoxin levels for

478
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,278
these over on the right um there's a

479
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,560
hundredfold difference in endotoxins

480
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:53,759
between sample 5 and Sample 8 and that's

481
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,159
pretty close to what we're seeing in

482
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,440
qpcr we're getting about a 58 to 174

483
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:02,000
fold offset between Grand posi gr

484
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,959
negative um results there so there's the

485
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,400
correlation here is getting closer to 6

486
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,798
now uh where the qpcr can predict the

487
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
endotoxin loads to some degree uh it's

488
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,759
not 0.9 which is where we want to try

489
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,439
and push this to but um it may be maybe

490
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,000
it's a tool that can help flag samples

491
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,240
that might need a further scrutiny for

492
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,318
this test now this endotoxin test since

493
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,120
we're running uh you know four different

494
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,000
serial dilutions uh it's about $10 a

495
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,359
well so it ends up being like a $40 test

496
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,038
even though the instruments very cheap

497
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,918
the reagents are a little bit expensive

498
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,240
and temperamental um you have to use

499
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,600
them kind of the day you open them

500
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,319
otherwise they get contaminated with

501
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:37,399
Airborne endotoxins so um but

502
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,159
nevertheless you can see the endotoxins

503
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,440
on the on the scale there there are many

504
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,919
samples cracking the 100,000 eus per ml

505
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,640
uh we're getting we're talking about you

506
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,240
know four orders of magnitude over the

507
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,360
decost limit here um now this needs to

508
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,679
be checked with mass back and it

509
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:54,240
probably needs to be looked at through

510
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,400
aerosols like what happens with aerosols

511
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,240
uh like when you burn this stuff um you

512
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,919
we do know that it's autoclave uh

513
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,720
tolerant so you can't get rid of it with

514
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,280
autoclaves we don't know how much of

515
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,000
it's going to end up in the smoke and

516
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,558
that's really I think what needs to be

517
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,240
um scrutinized next um you can also run

518
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,399
these assays with and without this Grim

519
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,480
reefer tool this nuclease that destroys

520
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,600
the dead DNA and the correlations get a

521
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,319
little bit better uh you can see on top

522
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,918
are the same samples this is sample

523
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,079
seven and Sample eight and when you add

524
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,320
in this nucleus the all the CT curves

525
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,240
kind of shift to the right um and we can

526
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,798
see we begin to quantitate how much more

527
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,240
gram negative DNA is actually around in

528
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:35,079
the sample uh here's just a chart of um

529
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,960
five different samples um that came

530
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,599
through I think these were PT samples AO

531
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,798
CPT samples that we were taking a look

532
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:43,399
at uh and you can see these large

533
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,599
offsets on the top one there's gr means

534
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,640
Grim reefer and no Grim reefer is the no

535
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,959
grr and you can see that the CT scores

536
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,600
when uh you don't use that nucleus are

537
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,360
lower for those not familiar with PCR

538
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:57,959
lower CT scores mean more uh and it's a

539
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,079
log two scale so when you see like a 10

540
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,960
CT offset that uh you're look you're

541
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,399
looking at um about a thousandfold u

542
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,400
difference there it's about 3.3 CTS for

543
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,798
every scale of 10 okay uh so there's a

544
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,240
you can see a big shift here between

545
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:15,720
live dead so we can we can detect which

546
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,599
samples uh are in fact we believe are

547
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,600
potentially been put through some type

548
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,519
of remediation process by looking at the

549
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,879
change in these signals not all the

550
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,918
samples show the signature uh which is a

551
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,480
sign that some samples in this in this

552
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,520
um set of of uh of um PT standards were

553
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,200
decontaminated or remediated and some

554
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:36,679
were

555
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,919
not okay so just to summarize a little

556
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,038
bit here the nucleas treatments we think

557
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,400
are can be very helpful to discriminate

558
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,759
between live dead um there are high

559
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,919
amounts of gram negative DNA and these

560
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,798
are correlating with a correlation about

561
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,280
I think it was 62 on that last slide uh

562
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,720
between um you know PCR signal and

563
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,879
endotoxin load uh We've also run um

564
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,679
tac tac Q PCR this we've run our CA form

565
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,360
PCR we've run a variety of other

566
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,440
orthogonal pcrs I didn't have time to

567
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,000
show here that confirm this this DNA is

568
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,919
in fact there um it's soften living but

569
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,480
the challenge that we have is um the

570
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,480
plating is blind to these risks of

571
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,038
people using remediation U so we really

572
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,480
need to think through this because if we

573
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:20,960
if we're not labeling for radiation

574
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,360
asmatics are going to be concerned

575
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,279
because there's a Temptation for Growers

576
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,240
to grow dirty and just blast things when

577
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,079
they're done and anyone who knows

578
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,759
manufacturing you want to fix that at

579
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,279
the sort of of the problem and grow

580
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,480
clean and not have to do that uh so um

581
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,000
the right now we're very blind to this

582
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,759
in the field is that when people

583
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,119
remediate this remediation there's no

584
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,759
reason to believe this is removing the

585
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:44,239
endotoxin I think I think we've got hard

586
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,519
evidence it's not removing the endotoxin

587
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,159
so it's just masking a potential risk uh

588
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,200
from uh from the patients uh by being

589
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,159
able to run this through a a viability

590
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,519
assay if you will um there's a pre-print

591
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,559
here that you can get more information

592
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,599
on um and uh there are other confounded

593
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,558
ERS we have to think about now I I get a

594
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,199
lot of people throw um the accusation at

595
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,119
me that I'm just druming up fear porn to

596
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,840
do more testing uh we don't make any

597
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,479
money on this L test it's not something

598
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,000
we sell or make um and and they're right

599
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,960
in the fact that this is an infrequent

600
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,038
case in fact it's very hard for you to

601
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,159
get um you know to be pitchforking the

602
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,200
employer here because we've never seen

603
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:24,720
this before no one's looking for

604
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,278
endotoxin uh and uh you know it's it's

605
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,720
something that is it's a complete

606
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:31,119
tragedy but we don't really understand

607
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,759
why it occurred at the same time there's

608
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,798
a lot of cannabis use out there and we

609
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,480
don't have people dropping from from

610
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,119
deaths from asthma everywhere at least

611
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,278
if they are they're they're not reported

612
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:41,479
or they're not happening in the

613
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:43,240
workplace maybe there is endotoxin

614
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,640
loaded material hitting asmatics outside

615
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,440
of the workplace and we would never have

616
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,360
it really recorded as a hazardous risk

617
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,720
so we do have to put this into context

618
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,558
there are other confounders that

619
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,960
occurred during this death this was

620
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,759
during the pandemic and there is a

621
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,240
Litany of Publications out there showing

622
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:00,679
that the spike protein both from the

623
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,519
virus and from the vaccine exacerbate

624
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,360
LPS and du cyto storms Google this

625
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,720
you'll find tons of papers on this in

626
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:11,079
fact the cyto storms in uh covid are an

627
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,440
artifact uh and often manifest

628
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,558
themselves in what appears to be sepsis

629
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,200
which is um a condition of a you know

630
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,480
ayine storm so we don't know the status

631
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
here of this patient we don't know if

632
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,159
they're vaccinated we don't know if they

633
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,400
were sick or recently recovered or had

634
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,278
long covid um these are all unknowns but

635
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,080
this is perhaps one of these other

636
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,839
confounders that might be making this

637
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:34,038
lightning strike event more apparent

638
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:36,079
these days um and and something to to

639
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,839
consider that uh these are this is

640
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,439
probably not being considered in general

641
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,720
throughout um uh you know measuring this

642
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,960
type of uh

643
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,519
epidemiology so um I do want to point

644
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,720
out though there are papers showing um

645
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,759
vaccination uh can actually drive

646
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,640
asmatic reactions like this and we were

647
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,400
in a state that mandated vaccines for

648
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,919
people over a uh over 100 employees so

649
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,120
they were larger than that and maybe

650
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,480
that maybe that's playing a role

651
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,038
um so the conclusions here the the

652
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,960
endotoxin levels are from this from this

653
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,400
La assay I want to be very specific here

654
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,640
because this does need to be confirmed

655
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,400
with alternative methods right now but

656
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
from this laay they are exceeding the

657
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
decost limits by orders of magnitude on

658
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,000
cannabis it's on every sample we've

659
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,119
measured so far um remediation hides

660
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,960
this risk we have no labeling of this

661
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,918
type of remediation and we probably need

662
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,278
it for asthmatics if we want to avoid

663
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,000
future fatalities like this um going

664
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:30,798
forward and um there are environmental

665
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,480
confound now in the environment that are

666
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,720
playing or interfacing with LPS so um

667
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,599
this is something that wasn't present in

668
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,038
2000 and no one probably could have

669
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,599
anticipated um and there is a strong

670
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,798
amount of um literature out there

671
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,278
suggesting maybe the mass specs we have

672
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,240
in the Cannabis Testing Labs can run

673
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:50,038
these types of assays because uh this

674
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,278
would be a great way to confirm what's

675
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,278
going on with thermos assay is to see if

676
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:56,319
these Mass specs come up with similar

677
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:57,640
quantitation um so anyone out there who

678
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,319
wants to collaborate on that with mass

679
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,960
spec equipments this would be something

680
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:02,558
that you could probably hopefully run on

681
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,120
existing equipment that's already in the

682
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,119
Cannabis Testing uh pipeline um and uh I

683
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,119
think we do need to look at this in

684
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,719
aerosols we are just measuring what

685
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,759
homogenizes off of a gram we don't we do

686
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,960
not know what happens when we burn this

687
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,240
and pull it through uh as as a smoked

688
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,759
flower that's something that is uh you

689
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,200
know we're making some leaps here as to

690
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,558
what we're finding on the flower and if

691
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,919
any of that's going to make it into the

692
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,278
patient um after pyrolytic so U and with

693
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
that I will I will leave it with

694
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,880
questions I apologize when over this

695
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,278
clock didn't really start on time and so

696
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,278
I could be

697
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,480
late oh one more slide yes I've got to

698
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,049
say thank you for all the people who

699
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,120
worked on

700
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:45,440
[Laughter]

701
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:48,000
this um any yes

702
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,000
please my question is what was your

703
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,798
negative control on this if you uh when

704
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,599
you were looking at your samples on the

705
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,519
LA assay oh great great question so the

706
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,038
thermo kit comes with endotoxin-free

707
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,519
water and that is an important point

708
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:05,359
because many Ro systems don't perfectly

709
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:09,918
clean it out uh so you have to get very

710
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:11,558
specific water from um uh uh from uh

711
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,919
from Thermo uh and run that through the

712
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:17,480
assay but you didn't have a bacterial

713
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:20,120
free cannabis sample D no I can't find

714
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,558
one that's why I was going to ask if I

715
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,398
could have some yeah yes um but we did

716
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,839
run we did run tobacco I didn't put that

717
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,759
in there but the tobacco's loaded with

718
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,439
it too and it was more it was higher on

719
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,038
the pipe to tobacco than in the world

720
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,080
cigarette tobacco which was interesting

721
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:37,480
to us uh and we have since this I wrote

722
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,558
up these slides we have run um flower uh

723
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,360
versus pre-rolls we initially focused on

724
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:42,918
pre-rolls because the pre-rolls tend to

725
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,398
have a higher microbial fail if you look

726
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:45,799
through Sherman's data there's much

727
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:47,278
higher fail rate in pre-rolls I think

728
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,000
everyone just throws their their junk

729
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,359
into the pre-roll bucket um and so we

730
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,240
figured the numbers would be higher

731
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,000
there we looked at some like flower hemp

732
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,679
that we're able to get from Oregon um

733
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,960
and Oregon doesn't have they probably

734
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,399
the most lenient testing out there and

735
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,919
uh um those were equivalent so we didn't

736
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:04,359
see a big difference between pre-rolls

737
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,679
and flowers at least in that

738
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:09,158
circumstance but yeah tobacco has this

739
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,880
as well yeah to you you would see it in

740
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:12,799
pipe tobacco more because it's cured in

741
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,360
a different way than cigarette tobacco

742
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,359
no okay interesting

743
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:28,480
yeah okay I think uh oh Sherman's got a

744
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:29,319
question all right actually Kevin um I'd

745
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,278
like

746
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:35,720
to if I may u first of all thank you

747
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:37,480
very much for excellent talk on your

748
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,558
work i' like to just make a quick

749
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,798
comment from a regulatory

750
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:45,798
Viewpoint um there's a couple of States

751
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:51,599
because you mentioned in your talk that

752
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:54,079
remediation of uh flour you know can um

753
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,599
in killing the gram negative bacteria

754
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,720
could be a source of

755
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:01,519
endotoxins and there are a couple of

756
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,839
states that have much lower for example

757
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:08,440
total yeast and mold action levels of 10

758
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:11,158
to the three which may cause cultivators

759
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,759
to do this pre- remediation that's a

760
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,520
good point so maybe Illinois would be a

761
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:17,879
good place to look because there would

762
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:20,839
be more remediation going on there um

763
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,399
yeah sadly uh when we're looking at the

764
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:25,199
you know the hemp samples that that go

765
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:28,158
through no microbial screening versus

766
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,240
the ones in Massachusetts that uh

767
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,278
through the dispensary system we're

768
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,120
still getting very similar endotoxin

769
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,440
loads the plating is completely

770
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,479
different it's night and day on the on

771
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,679
the plates but um I I have a feeling

772
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,440
that's we we don't know this but I have

773
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,080
I'm assuming that someone is in fact

774
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,600
decontaminating the samples particularly

775
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:47,199
if they're if they're pre-rolls uh and

776
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,558
therefore we get nothing on plating and

777
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,558
we get endotoxins that are off the

778
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,868
chart all right

779
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,869
[Applause]
