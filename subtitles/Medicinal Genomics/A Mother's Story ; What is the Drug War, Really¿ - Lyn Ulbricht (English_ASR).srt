1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,940
hi I'm Lin ohlbrecht and I'm really

2
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:13,298
honored to be here with so many

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:16,660
qualified people my qualification I'm

4
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:18,910
Ross Ulbricht mother but that has given

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,629
me a crash course in the drug war and

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:26,050
what I think it's really about my son

7
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:29,259
Ross is a peaceful person he has no

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:32,770
history of violence whatsoever and yet

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,100
the judge sentenced him to a double life

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:40,810
without parole plus 40 years for all

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:43,500
nonviolent charges he's an example of

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,050
what's going on and the war on drugs the

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,880
government wants to cage Ross for life

14
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,669
for creating and allegedly running a

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,560
website so everyone who is a website

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,079
that might be interesting for the

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,780
government should take note of the

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,210
precedent that is being set here the

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,700
precedent is that a website host can be

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,180
held criminally liable for activity on

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,700
his or her site Ross is in prison not

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,970
for selling a product but for creating a

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,329
platform the site was Silk Road it was

24
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:20,109
an Amazon style online marketplace that

25
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:22,629
operated anonymously on the darknet with

26
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:26,439
tor and used the cryptocurrency Bitcoin

27
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:28,719
it was essentially a a free and open

28
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,090
market where vendors and buyers could

29
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,459
pretty much sell and buy whatever they

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,010
wanted however there were restrictions

31
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:38,739
the site was based on the principle of

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,469
everything being voluntary so the

33
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:45,089
administration restricted things that

34
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:47,709
created victims such as forbidden were

35
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,109
child pornography there was no child

36
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:54,000
pornography there were no stolen goods

37
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:56,920
you couldn't hire a hitman on Silk Road

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,769
nothing that created victims there are

39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:05,228
many legal things sold but also illegal

40
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:08,079
including a lot of drugs now I said

41
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:12,340
allegedly running because Ross has pled

42
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:15,400
not guilty to that the trial was a

43
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,020
travesty it is now being appealed the

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,240
investigation was riddled with

45
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,150
corruption there are

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,580
two corrupt federal agents in prison

47
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,580
right now for their activities on the

48
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,820
site and their ability to tamper with

49
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,360
material on the site as well as stealing

50
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:36,180
over a million dollars and recently

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,750
since trial that proof has been found

52
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,010
that evidence was tampered with and

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:46,620
there's a whole lot more that you can

54
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:49,379
read about at free Ross org now before

55
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,480
Ross was arrested I didn't really think

56
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,519
much about the drug war it wasn't really

57
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,169
on my radar my kids didn't have a drug

58
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,270
problem they hadn't gotten in trouble

59
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:59,939
about drugs and so I didn't really think

60
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,490
about it and then all of a sudden my son

61
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,579
was the poster boy of the drug war or at

62
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:07,409
least as it's gone digital and so I was

63
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,940
propelled into the crash course I told

64
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:13,799
you about where I've learned a lot and I

65
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:16,319
was talking recently with Ross about the

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,390
drug war and and he made the point he

67
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,359
said you know no decent person would

68
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:24,449
wish that destructive drugs like heroin

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,910
or crystal meth existed the trouble is

70
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:29,609
when you use government force to fulfill

71
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:35,419
your wishes first of all it doesn't work

72
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:38,490
and it compounds the misery involved

73
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:43,109
they can't even stop drug dealing and

74
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,210
drug use in the prisons so the drug war

75
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,700
has not worked

76
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:51,090
it's been over forty five years now over

77
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:53,969
a trillion dollars and I've asked myself

78
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,020
you know well if it's such a failure why

79
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:56,939
doesn't the government try a new

80
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,400
strategy why don't they do something

81
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,759
that works and I've come to the

82
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,819
conclusion that it's not such a failure

83
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:09,599
after all just consider what it's

84
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:12,509
accomplished see the results if you want

85
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,459
to make a lot of money you want to

86
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,629
expand government power and the ability

87
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,939
to intrude

88
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:21,810
the drug war has been a resounding

89
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:24,379
success unfortunately in the process

90
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,569
countless lives have been destroyed a

91
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:29,250
trillion dollars has been wasted and our

92
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,730
constitutional protections have been

93
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,339
terribly weakened

94
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:37,259
the drugs war started out by ignoring

95
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,709
the Constitution and it's continued on

96
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:44,730
from there when the government wanted to

97
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:47,789
prohibit alcohol use it passed the 19th

98
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:50,879
amendment a constitutional amendment and

99
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,590
then 13 years later when it realized it

100
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,409
wasn't working because prohibition never

101
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:57,899
does it passed the 21st amendment to

102
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,669
repeal prohibition well with the drug

103
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,489
war the government hasn't bothered with

104
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:04,889
all that they've just declared the drug

105
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,009
war and given themselves the authority

106
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:12,870
to wage it and one of the obvious

107
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:15,449
casualties of it is the erosion of the

108
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,019
Fourth Amendment the Fourth Amendment is

109
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,750
the the document that protects our

110
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:25,439
privacy and in this day and age privacy

111
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:29,250
is a huge issue and it's a major part of

112
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,889
Ross's appeal because unconstitutional

113
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,918
warrants and sometimes no warrants were

114
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:37,650
used in his case and his defense isn't

115
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,629
the only one saying this the National

116
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:42,389
Association of criminal defense lawyers

117
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:46,319
and EF F Electronic Frontier Foundation

118
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,240
joined Ross's appeal to say yes these

119
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,139
are unconstitutional warrants and should

120
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,139
not be allowed and Ross's case isn't

121
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,689
unique you can't even begin to calculate

122
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:00,209
the number of people who have been had

123
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,300
property seized been searched with

124
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:07,069
unlawful improper warrants

125
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,069
not to mention on illegal surveillance

126
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,650
unlawful wiretapping raiding homes with

127
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,550
SWAT teams on flimsy evidence sometimes

128
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:19,199
seriously harming people and all under

129
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,538
the name of the drug war so it's all ok

130
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,759
and this is basically what happened to

131
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:27,240
Ross the government essentially said

132
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,349
that because drugs are involved they

133
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,538
could pretty much do whatever they

134
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:34,560
wanted they could ignore his due process

135
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:36,000
rights and trial or trample on them they

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,750
could keep the jury from knowing about

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,089
corrupt investigators they could smear

138
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,740
his name with unproven and uncharged

139
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:48,929
allegations and many more

140
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:53,100
violations this sets a very dangerous

141
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:56,069
precedent and now there's an entrenched

142
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,439
and generally accepted drug exception in

143
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,180
the courts where if drugs are involved

144
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,050
the Constitution essentially takes a

145
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,030
backseat one lawyer called this the get

146
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,490
out of your constitutional obligations

147
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:14,539
free card for law enforcement and

148
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:17,579
prosecutors Thurgood Marshall in 1989

149
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,710
saw the slippery slope that the drug war

150
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:22,709
was putting us on and he dissented in a

151
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:26,370
Supreme Court decision that was it was a

152
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:29,430
drug testing case that used the drug

153
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:31,649
exception and he said no there is no

154
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,319
drug exception to the Constitution

155
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:40,529
there's no exception and principles of

156
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:42,870
law once bent do not snap back easily so

157
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:48,769
what is the result of this overreach and

158
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:51,780
this bending of the principle of law

159
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:55,500
which doesn't only affect drug cases by

160
00:07:51,779 --> 00:08:00,479
the way once law is bent and and damaged

161
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,100
it filters into all kinds of cases well

162
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,680
it's given the United States the dubious

163
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,470
honor of caging more of its citizens

164
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,110
than any nation on the face of the earth

165
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:13,040
this is the land of the free as this

166
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,600
chart illustrates the prison population

167
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:22,110
since the 80s and the drug war has

168
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:26,420
metastasized 500% is the latest figure

169
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:30,540
I've seen 2.2 million people in prison

170
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,960
this is a 500% increase and over half of

171
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,668
these people well over half are

172
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:40,009
nonviolent drug offenders and the main

173
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:40,009
drug involved is marijuana

174
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:46,379
the US has 5 percent of the world's

175
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,250
population and 25 percent of its

176
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:52,320
prisoners there are more people under

177
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:55,889
correctional supervision in the United

178
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,760
States than were in the Gulag

179
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,490
Archipelago

180
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:03,629
under Stalin at its height according to

181
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:07,049
book caging of America so what are some

182
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:11,580
of the policies that have reaped this

183
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:14,219
evil and tragic harvest mandatory

184
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,520
minimums which take judicial discretion

185
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,120
away from judges and sentencing longer

186
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,370
sentences and a spike in life sentences

187
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,459
have all crammed our prisons to

188
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,778
overflowing now according to the

189
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:33,179
Sentencing Project life sentences have

190
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:38,070
quintupled there are five times as many

191
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:41,370
as were in 1984 and the drug war one in

192
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:46,410
seven prisoners are sentenced to die in

193
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:48,990
prison one in seven over 17,000 of those

194
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:53,039
people that are serving life sentences

195
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,409
like Rosses are nonviolent people who

196
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:59,458
like Ross have never physically harmed

197
00:09:55,409 --> 00:10:01,230
or threatened anyone and now because

198
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:05,189
there's no parole in the federal system

199
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:08,100
again since the 80s life means life and

200
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,230
Ross said to me he said mom a life

201
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:15,440
sentence is a death sentence it just

202
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:19,528
takes longer now this is a quote from

203
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:23,430
the Atlantic by Judge Federal Judge

204
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:25,470
former federal judge nancy gertner who

205
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:28,439
is now a professor a law professor at

206
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,450
Harvard and judge Gertner said that the

207
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,940
vast majority of the sentences she had

208
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,970
to impose over the 17 years she served

209
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:39,800
on the bench were unjustified and she

210
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:43,500
believes Ross's is - which is why she

211
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:48,240
joined Ross's appeal challenging that

212
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,278
sentence as did drug policy Alliance Law

213
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,070
Enforcement Against Prohibition and just

214
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:59,838
leadership USA who said this sentence is

215
00:10:53,070 --> 00:11:01,860
excessive barbaric and unfair and

216
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,279
taxpayers are footing the bill for

217
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,600
housing all of these people for life

218
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:09,659
there's a lot of money being generated

219
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,070
more than 80 billion dollars a year on

220
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:14,969
this system and

221
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,190
so there's people who are very

222
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,330
interested in keeping it going now who

223
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:24,000
is that I think you can get a good idea

224
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:27,750
from this list the top 5 anti marijuana

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,330
legalization groups first we have the

226
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,839
private prisons where human beings are

227
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:37,500
inventory they have lockup quotas that

228
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,230
they have to meet that gives them every

229
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,690
incentive to keep those cages full you

230
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,940
can invest in human beings on Wall

231
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,890
Street even if you're a judge and a

232
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,120
prosecutor by investing in these private

233
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:53,250
prisons I would like someone to explain

234
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,720
to me how this is not human trafficking

235
00:11:53,250 --> 00:12:00,570
or even slavery then you have the police

236
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,850
unions and the prison guard unions one

237
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:06,740
person wrote the drug war is not a war

238
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:09,240
it's a jobs program and Mark Victor

239
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,009
writes about how he had a law

240
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,600
enforcement officer say to him yeah I'm

241
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:17,309
for the drug war I'd be unemployed

242
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,960
without the drug war the FBI data shows

243
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:22,709
that there are more arrests for

244
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,650
marijuana possession than alone than for

245
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,839
all violent crimes combined wow I feel

246
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,299
safer don't you I'm terrified of those

247
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,830
pot smokers I'm so glad they're behind

248
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,009
bars and you know don't worry about the

249
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,100
violent people

250
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:40,319
then there's asset forfeiture which

251
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,659
comes to billions of dollars that the

252
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,460
government's in various agencies seizes

253
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:50,879
from citizens it's often unconvicted

254
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:53,610
under the name of the drug war next on

255
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,700
the list are pharmaceutical corporations

256
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,930
and alcohol and beer companies well what

257
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,160
better way to eliminate the competition

258
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:05,159
than to keep it illegal and not on the

259
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,079
list but worth mentioning are the

260
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:11,850
violent cartels the violent drug cartels

261
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:13,980
that infest our cities and are attracted

262
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:17,278
and are able to have the power they do

263
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:22,680
because of the artificially inflated

264
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:25,950
prices that drugs get and there's also

265
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,489
the banks like hsbc who launder billions

266
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,028
of

267
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:34,230
in drug money and nobody went to jail it

268
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:36,450
would they paid a fine so unless you

269
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,028
measure the human costs the drug war is

270
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,730
quite successful but of course there are

271
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:45,059
terrible human costs statistics are real

272
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,250
people Ross is one of them I am one of

273
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,989
them because I can tell you when you

274
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,289
have a loved one in prison the whole

275
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,180
family is doing time here I am going to

276
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:57,028
the prison to visit Ross which I do

277
00:13:54,179 --> 00:14:00,509
regularly and I've gotten to know the

278
00:13:57,028 --> 00:14:03,120
other families and the children and the

279
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:05,549
children of the real heartbreak they

280
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,589
come so excited and enthusiastic about

281
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:10,740
seeing their dad a lot of them have a

282
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:13,290
little t-shirt I love my dad and they're

283
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,019
just jumping up and down with enthusiasm

284
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:17,399
and when we get upstairs they leap into

285
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,610
his arms and they're crawling all over

286
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,980
them and sitting in his lab and just

287
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,800
clinging to him and then after our

288
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,050
measly hour they're torn away from him

289
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,000
and it's a very different child going

290
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:33,269
back down on that elevator they're

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,149
crying they're brokenhearted they're

292
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:39,838
wounded these children are being hurt

293
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:41,759
and there are 2.9 million of them with

294
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,440
an incarcerated parent in this country

295
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:48,600
and 2/3 of those parents are nonviolent

296
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,060
mostly drug offenders and there's a

297
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,930
terrible ripple effect from this judge

298
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:56,849
Gertner said we know that the sons and

299
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:58,259
daughters of the people we sentenced are

300
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:03,180
now in trouble with the criminal justice

301
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:05,549
system but hey that's guaranteed

302
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:09,299
inventory for the people making money

303
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:11,849
off of this drug war and this system so

304
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:14,479
no problem with that plenty of future

305
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,070
inventory I had the privilege of

306
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,920
speaking in Eastern Europe about a year

307
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:21,629
and a half ago and I visited the

308
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,559
concentration camp Auschwitz in Poland

309
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:27,929
and Here I am at Auschwitz it was an

310
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:31,528
incredibly grim and impactful experience

311
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:33,569
to be there and to actually experience a

312
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:35,909
place where people did this to other

313
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,620
people it was hard to believe it even

314
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:39,919
happened

315
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:42,740
and I overheard a tour guide say to his

316
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,610
group the lesson here is watch your

317
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:49,009
politicians this wasn't that long ago

318
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,740
now I'm not implying that where Ross is

319
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:55,059
is comparable to Auschwitz although that

320
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,370
although the UN has called MCC torture

321
00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:00,649
but it's not Auschwitz

322
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:04,639
however concentration camps and gulags

323
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:06,079
were created by governments who claimed

324
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,259
the group they were doing the greater

325
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:13,850
good also and who were fulfilling wishes

326
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:16,519
with force also we need to pay attention

327
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:21,170
to what's happening here and where we're

328
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:23,629
going we need to end the drug war it's a

329
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:28,699
national disgrace and it's a crime

330
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:33,379
against humanity here is my son Ross in

331
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:36,440
