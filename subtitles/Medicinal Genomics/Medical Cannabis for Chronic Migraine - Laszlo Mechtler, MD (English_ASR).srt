1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,940
there was a comment made that I couldn't

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,320
get rid of is that in the United States

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,620
research is apparently in the private

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,198
sector at in Canada it's University

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,079
there's exceptions to the rule

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,820
I agree that Buffalo is on the border of

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,879
Canada the United States but still the

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,480
USA so I'm going to present my research

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:30,358
uh that we I have done now my background

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,859
is I have five board certifications uh

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,100
professor of Neurology oncology

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,280
neurology headache medicine

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,260
and neuroimaging and uh so I went

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,939
through the academic world and the last

15
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,799
time I gave this talk was that the

16
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:47,099
American Academy of Neurology

17
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:50,280
where there was 400 people in the room

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,879
and they had to get an overflow room

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,239
to tell you the interest at the

20
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:59,460
neurological level in academic medicine

21
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:02,280
so there's a tremendous interest and I

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,660
would love to see more Physicians come

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,460
down for this meeting because I think

24
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,899
it's well worthwhile to network with

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,599
that Physician Group

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,659
so I'm going to as you can tell I I

27
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,599
presently run about

28
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:18,420
110 research studies with Pharma so I'm

29
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,519
I'm in bed with Pharma big time and in

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,680
fact when I talk about migraines the

31
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,879
last eight drugs that have been FDA

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,220
approved

33
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,699
which is worth what billions for each

34
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:32,400
company eight different companies uh I

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,640
was uh I did I was part of the research

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,859
team that did that at our Institute

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,978
this is the Institute and I think the

38
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,078
most important part of it is is the 13

39
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:46,078
000 cannabis patients that we actively

40
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,239
see so you understand that this

41
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,438
NeuroScience Center sees about

42
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:56,399
uh 1 300 patients on a daily basis

43
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:58,859
so although it was 250 are migranters or

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,560
headache patients so that we have a huge

45
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,478
volume and the reason I chose migraines

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,540
being the director of the migraine and

47
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:09,060
the canvas Clinic it was so easy to do I

48
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,200
also I'm a chief of neuroncology so I

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,560
was very much interested in the

50
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:17,000
glioblastoma uh literature in cannabis

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,699
which is very new uh probably more

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,340
advanced in England and Spain but also I

53
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,259
I run a center in Europe uh called The

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,900
Mind clinic and that's in Budapest

55
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:30,479
Hungary it's a NeuroScience Center

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,400
so this is a breakdown of our cannabis

57
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,378
clinic so we have thirteen thousand and

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,780
seven that's pretty up to date this is

59
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:39,959
in the New York State uh medical

60
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,598
marijuana program or cannabis program as

61
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,739
I like to call it is is

62
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:49,799
um is quite regulated quite expensive

63
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:52,560
but you know it's it's we I'm about 10

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,379
or 11 of the whole state seeing patients

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,739
so we see a significant amount as you

66
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:00,598
can tell chronic pain is 70 and you go

67
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,519
down the list of cancer neuropathies

68
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:06,299
many of the chronic pain patients by the

69
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,719
way have cancer and other disorders so I

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,459
I uh you know I did I did one thing I

71
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,158
told the patients I won't accept a

72
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,319
dollar from you in cash but then you

73
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,079
have to fill out all this data and

74
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,878
that's your sacrifice and they trust me

75
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,099
they agreed to that so we have a huge

76
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,959
amount of data intake we don't send

77
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,060
patients away for a year we bring them

78
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,699
back depending on the disease state but

79
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,878
no longer than two to three months so

80
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,560
this way I'm gathering the data and I

81
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,239
agree

82
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,340
as somebody who runs around to my

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,920
studies I'm going to talk to you about

84
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,620
large population retrospective studies

85
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,958
the criticism of cannabis research over

86
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,599
the years has been obviously that this

87
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,120
numbers have been relatively small

88
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:54,839
so I talked about legitimacy only

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,500
because uh uh my fight is not with the

90
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Cannabis uh users or the business my

91
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,739
fight is to uh uh talk to the

92
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,319
academicians the presidents of societies

93
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,939
uh and change their attitudes to

94
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:13,399
cannabis and I know a lot of people in

95
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:16,918
the audience uh Bonnie Ethan

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,918
Dustin have also had this fight for many

97
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,478
years some longer than others but it's a

98
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,819
long-term fight and I didn't understand

99
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,399
that fight until I got into cannabis

100
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,459
about seven years ago which is when New

101
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,679
York State uh uh

102
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:33,899
legalized it now one of the other

103
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,300
reasons is that as a migraine specialist

104
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:38,659
who runs a large probably the largest

105
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,220
migraine Center in the country

106
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:45,360
many of my predecessors the people I

107
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,580
looked up to uh were actually gowers

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,280
from England who was a neurologist a

109
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,319
father of Neurology osley a father of

110
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,779
modern medicine from Canada who

111
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,879
developed Johns Hopkins these

112
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,279
individuals in their books at the 200th

113
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,519
Century the previous Century wrote about

114
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,799
use of cannabis in in the treatment of

115
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,120
headaches and migraines so in fact that

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,819
was probably one of the most common

117
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,939
cause and O'Shaughnessy in Calcutta did

118
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,040
the first scientific studies of pain

119
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:16,199
endometriosis went back to England to

120
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,020
treat the queen at that time and this is

121
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:22,080
something you all know uh is that

122
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,698
cannabis or marijuana extracts with the

123
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,879
first second and third most prescribed

124
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,740
meds between 1842 and 1890. if you don't

125
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,319
know the history of what happened and I

126
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,079
presumed this audience does

127
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,079
look it up review it because it's really

128
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,198
it opens your eyes how politics business

129
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,719
influence medicine so this is two

130
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,960
studies that I quoting you so I firmly

131
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,580
believe that people people ask me do I

132
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,859
smoke I said I don't

133
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:53,038
but I don't even drink and I don't I

134
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,038
don't smoke tobacco but many of these

135
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,839
so-called uh alcohol is being used for

136
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,120
medical reasons we all know that many

137
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:04,138
alcoholics become alcoholics because of

138
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:08,459
under underlining anxiety depression uh

139
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:10,918
PTSD so the bottom line is that that in

140
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,680
my opinion more people use medical

141
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,680
marijuana recreationally I'm a medically

142
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,959
than Recreation then we are understand I

143
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,780
went to Colorado at the beginning of my

144
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,359
search for this knowledge and I asked I

145
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:26,698
went to a bartender in a you know in

146
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,139
Colorado and asked him then what CBD

147
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,800
products do you have he said we don't

148
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,660
have many CBD products that go so

149
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,038
everything we have is THC I said why is

150
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,620
that because everybody wants to get high

151
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:41,038
and so how about my grandmother who's

152
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,560
got rheumatoid right arthritis at age 78

153
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,899
I need some kind of cannabinoid and the

154
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,879
reply was the same she wants to get high

155
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,698
and that's not the fact because in my

156
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,038
thirteen thousand patient I the question

157
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,800
I asked routinely it's it's on the data

158
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,259
do you get high from the cannabinoids

159
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,060
I'm giving you and the answer is in 99

160
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:03,419
no

161
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,978
so so there is this population out there

162
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:07,740
and I'm talking about medical marijuana

163
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:10,019
not recreational some people get drink

164
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,600
alcohol to get drunk some people use

165
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,459
alcohol on a daily basis to maintain

166
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,139
their quality of life whatever that may

167
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,120
be

168
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm not going to review that but the

169
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,519
endogenous cannabinoids which have well

170
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,919
be discussed uh and and uh and

171
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,079
phytocannabinoid noise we all know these

172
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,019
types and some of the you know these

173
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:34,740
researchers are in the audience uh we I

174
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:36,598
also uh don't believe in sativa and

175
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,780
indica and strains I usually use the

176
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:43,680
type 1 type 2 type 3 cannabis uh

177
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,779
chemovars which I noted above here and

178
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,879
the clinical endocannary deficiency

179
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:51,119
something I'm I'm really interested in

180
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,159
because as a neurologist I treat a lot

181
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,259
of people Parkinson's disease and

182
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,620
Parkinson's disease is a lack of

183
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:01,038
dopamine

184
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:04,098
Alzheimer's a lack of acetylcholine

185
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:06,418
depression a lack of Serotonin and

186
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:10,139
norepinephrine so we have these

187
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:14,399
deficiency states in the diseases that I

188
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:17,639
treat on a routine basis uh and the

189
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,038
endocannide deficiency syndrome and by

190
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,259
the way the endocannabinoid system is

191
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,139
not taught in medical schools except for

192
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,419
about eight percent so there's this

193
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,120
obvious ignorance and I use the term

194
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:32,338
ignorance Loosely that Physicians don't

195
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,740
understand it and because they don't

196
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,919
understand it a physician will then

197
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,080
build those walls around them and say

198
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:42,299
not for my patients so we have to

199
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,300
educate at the medical school level

200
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,519
about the endocannibal deficiency yet I

201
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:50,219
have to commend Ethan Russo because he's

202
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,860
one of the strong voices in this

203
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,440
community that really tries to make

204
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,240
Physicians understand and I say try

205
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,580
because sometimes it doesn't work out

206
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,139
and he's already laughing because he

207
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,080
knows I'm going to show that slide to

208
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,278
have to get to you because it's very

209
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,800
important to understand that the

210
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,580
endocannibal deficiency may be occurring

211
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:13,559
in disorders uh Beyond migraine and if

212
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,600
you know the definition of comorbidity

213
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:19,079
comorbidity means that you have one

214
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,180
disease and another disease happens in

215
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,120
that one individual that's statistically

216
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:27,259
higher than by incidents for example

217
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,639
migraners have a high your incidents of

218
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:31,519
fibromyalgia or idiopathic bowel

219
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,480
syndrome

220
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,879
post-traumatic stress disorder bio

221
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,759
bipolar disorder anxiety and so on so

222
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,220
these these circles Envision a subset of

223
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,100
a population which is rather significant

224
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,879
because if you look at migraine uh the

225
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,620
the the incidence of migraine is 12

226
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:53,039
uh which is the prevalence rate is 12

227
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:56,220
around the world in women it's about 18

228
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:59,458
percent and in women between the age of

229
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:03,120
20 and 40 it's close to 40 percent

230
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:05,518
so 40 percent of women in here are

231
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,799
migrators if they know it or maybe they

232
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,820
don't know it but I promise you that

233
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:14,159
migraine is a disorder that is

234
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,980
tremendously easy to do research on

235
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,958
because we have a strict criteria what a

236
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,959
migraine is based on the international

237
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,899
Headache Society classification so these

238
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:28,018
disorders are natural to be treated in

239
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:31,559
our clinic this is in Pasadena I think

240
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:33,659
recently last time I think uh uh Dr

241
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,239
Michelle came to the United States and I

242
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,319
had an opportunity to talk to him about

243
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,720
his

244
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,300
um about his theories about the use of

245
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,740
cannabinoids and headaches and so on and

246
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:48,000
and obviously he's a Pioneer and I don't

247
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,980
know if we call it grandfather or

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,019
Godfather of research and cannabinoids

249
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,759
so we know about all this I'm not going

250
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,980
to go through this because this but this

251
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:59,100
is the picture I want to show you the

252
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,800
individual way on the left is uh uh is

253
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,480
uh is is the president of the American

254
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,659
Headache Society this is at the American

255
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,180
Headache Society Dr Silverstein then as

256
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:12,059
myself and the one who's got the

257
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,039
microphone is Ethan Russo oh and the one

258
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,379
next to him is the next president of the

259
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:18,778
American Headache Society and he and and

260
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:20,659
and coming from London England

261
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,939
originally from Australia

262
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:26,100
which maybe I I'll leave his name out

263
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,380
for now but the bottom line is as Ethan

264
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,839
is appropriately answering a question in

265
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:33,120
an audience much bigger than this

266
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,120
he got up and said this is [ __ ] and

267
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,799
left the panel now you don't see that in

268
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,860
academic medicine I think you don't see

269
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,479
it in many places uh I I hope Dustin

270
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,700
doesn't come up here and say this is

271
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,278
[ __ ] and pushes me off this after

272
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,500
because he has that potential I saw him

273
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,838
dance yesterday he's got a potential for

274
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,919
a lot so the bottom line is this is

275
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,459
really this just tells you the internal

276
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:01,919
resistance from academic medicine toward

277
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:05,099
individuals who have really uh put their

278
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,639
academic career and their life for a

279
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,680
cause as advocacy and with science so

280
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,360
this is just tells me about headaches

281
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,759
now migraines I won't get into but I

282
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,379
will tell you there the migraines is one

283
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,019
of the most common disorders in fact

284
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:20,720
according to the World Health

285
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,039
Organization who

286
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,740
chronic migraines is the second most

287
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,500
disabling disease in the world

288
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,440
first one is low back pain

289
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,778
and and so if you're a microner you can

290
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,880
see how much one suffers that's episodic

291
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,980
migraine which is the on the left you

292
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,679
know 40 to 72 hours unilow location

293
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,500
pulsating moderate to severe aggravated

294
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,838
by causing physical activity

295
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,820
you have migraines with aura but that's

296
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,380
only about 15 to 20 percent of all

297
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,940
migraines so people say oh I don't have

298
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,078
an aura so I don't have a migraine not

299
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,079
true

300
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,299
chronic migraine 40 of my clinic is

301
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:00,479
chronic migraine by definition more than

302
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:02,338
15 disabling headaches uh a month of

303
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,500
which eight have to be migrants lasted

304
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,959
more than four hours a day so this is

305
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,778
the definition of international Headache

306
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,458
Society definition of migraine this is a

307
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:14,039
migraine there's a pro drone which could

308
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:17,099
last 24 to 36 hours

309
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:19,019
where you have mood changes cravings for

310
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,778
example everybody thinks well I eat

311
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:23,820
chocolate and now I got a migraine and

312
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:26,639
chocolate caused a migraine when in fact

313
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,740
maybe the craving a hypothalamic

314
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,180
phenomena is the cause of you craving

315
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,360
for chocolate and it's part of the

316
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:37,138
migraine itself the aura occurs in 15 to

317
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,259
20 headache phase postro

318
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:43,200
all right so the the numbers are huge so

319
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:46,799
if you want to try or study a disorder

320
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,519
in medicine then migraine is ideal

321
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,819
because these patients are are

322
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,519
quite frequently in our in our practice

323
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,339
and and quite easy to treat because

324
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,200
micronares tend to have a higher

325
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,519
medical knowledge than non-migranters

326
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,259
and that's been shown I'm not going to

327
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,360
go through the pathophysiology but it's

328
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:09,000
interesting that the cortical spreading

329
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,879
depression is electrical phenomena uh

330
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,799
that was outlined by Leo from Brazil and

331
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,820
then it goes to the migraine generators

332
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:20,939
in the brain stem the rafae nuclei the

333
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,879
locus cerelius uh and then through the

334
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:28,380
trigeminal vasculature we have cgrp

335
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:31,019
being a new uh entity now cgrp I listed

336
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:33,899
one two three four cgrps but it says

337
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,778
three other ones called uh uh also so we

338
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,120
I studied seven cgrps all seven were

339
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:41,039
approved by the FDA so yes I'm a

340
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,740
superstar in headache medicine because

341
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,500
the the pharmaceutical companies love us

342
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,180
because we we did this study and it was

343
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,458
not just at my Institute it was a

344
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,679
multi-center study the other g-pan

345
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:55,198
answer called yeah the ones listed at

346
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,778
properties the ones on TV you bravi

347
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,819
neurotech and so on trip dance uh came

348
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:02,220
out in 1992 we thought that's going to

349
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,139
change headache medicine it did somewhat

350
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,620
ergot it means we don't use any more

351
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:09,600
came out in 1920s and but Botox which is

352
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,519
neurotoxin is still approved for chronic

353
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,680
migraine we also do research in

354
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,839
neurostimulators and then I add cannabis

355
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,698
at the end the thing about chronic

356
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,060
migraine ners people with chronic

357
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:23,698
migraine by the IHS definition they have

358
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,859
low anatomide levels so this is somebody

359
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:27,838
asked about can you do spinal taps on

360
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,300
these patients well this is a study

361
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,760
looking at spinal taps on patients with

362
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:35,219
migraines and looking at anandamide

363
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,679
levels or endocannibals and by the way

364
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,660
in chronic migraine they're low I truly

365
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,939
believe that when I see a patient and I

366
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,620
see a lot of patients is that some

367
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,440
patients will respond to cannabis

368
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,139
wonderfully and they're they say you've

369
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,820
changed my life some people don't and I

370
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:53,459
truly believe that this is part of of

371
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,120
the endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome

372
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:58,439
where phytocannabinoids supplement

373
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,620
endocannabinoids in individuals who have

374
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,019
low cannabinoid levels so so anandamide

375
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,360
levels have been shown low in chronic

376
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,159
migraine so this is some of the

377
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,039
re-studies we've done so we did see

378
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,480
initially we did 263 patients obviously

379
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,259
we have more than that but when we have

380
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,659
to go back 88.9

381
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:20,458
reported Improvement in migraine 83

382
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:22,919
percent of patients reported Improvement

383
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:25,500
of their headaches besides migraine and

384
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:27,838
51 on Ops were able to reduce their

385
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,860
consumption completely or significantly

386
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,260
so this is a chronic migraine study

387
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,120
so the efficacy of medical cannabinoids

388
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:39,240
seems to be dependent on the ratio of

389
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,179
THC and CBD what we use because we know

390
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,000
the ratios the one criticism on New York

391
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:48,059
State Canada cannabinoid program is it's

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,919
expensive the the positive is that it's

393
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:52,679
regulated relatively rigidly and

394
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,958
strictly appearance of a distinct group

395
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,479
of receptors type 1 type 2 I'm going to

396
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,698
show you the and what's interesting

397
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,199
about this cannabis and chronic migraine

398
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:07,379
is I did that in parallel to cgrp

399
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,539
monoclonal antibodies these are these

400
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,040
are shots given once a month or an IV

401
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,199
once every three months if you're

402
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,298
familiar with these drugs those drugs

403
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,679
have been approved by the efda and the

404
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:18,359
cost of that drug is about eight

405
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,240
thousand dollars a year

406
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,099
now insurance companies uh have accepted

407
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,679
the research and are now paying for

408
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,480
these drugs 8 000 a year they won't pay

409
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,820
for cannabinoids but they'll pay eight

410
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,039
thousand dollars Botox is about six

411
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:34,980
thousand five to six thousand dollars a

412
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:38,519
year uh for chronic migraines but the

413
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:41,160
results of the studies albeit my study

414
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:44,819
was retrospective but parallel to the

415
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,120
other studies I did with Pharma uh and

416
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:53,519
you could see the results in

417
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:56,339
171 patients there was a 25.7 percent

418
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,139
of patients had a 75 Improvement on

419
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,418
headaches on cannabinoids

420
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,100
that number is remarkable by the way if

421
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,380
you deal with headache medicine I think

422
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:07,519
we have neurologists in the audience but

423
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,559
you look at 63.2 percent had a 50

424
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:13,379
Improvement of chronic migraines which

425
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:16,619
the who has stated is the second most

426
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:19,799
disabling disorder in the world

427
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:21,479
so fifty percent Improvement of this

428
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,639
population which is the worst of the

429
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,558
worst by the way many of these have

430
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,080
sleep disturbance comorbidities of

431
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,940
depression anxiety fibromyalgia go down

432
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,460
the list irritable bowel syndrome so

433
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,980
this is a population that now even 80

434
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,519
said there was a 30 Improvement on

435
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,259
cannabinoids and so this is these

436
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,960
numbers are actually if you look

437
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,779
parallel to the cgrp monoclone

438
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,500
antibodies that were approved by the FDA

439
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:51,119
are very similar numbers except one's

440
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,519
retrospective and the other one's is

441
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,558
randomized studies and I agree with

442
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,960
academic medicine that random my Studies

443
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,399
have to be done but that's you know

444
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,558
that's the next question who will pay

445
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:07,860
for that so uh and then this one here 63

446
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,500
percent responded very similar to all

447
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,298
the cgrp monoclonal bodies and this is a

448
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,900
cannabis and chronic migraine in this

449
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:18,480
population at 41.8 percent decrease in

450
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,759
headache monthly headache days per month

451
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,538
and then average decrease in monthly

452
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:27,660
headache days uh was significant so

453
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:29,700
cannabis can work in chronic migraine by

454
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,798
improving the uh depressive levels

455
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,840
anxieties analgesia and to influence

456
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:36,440
there's many reasons why and I'm I'm

457
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,839
purpose did not get into the uh

458
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:43,140
pathophysiology of how cannabis affects

459
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:46,019
the central nervous system because a lot

460
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,538
of this information was given to you so

461
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:50,099
this is the cannaboids I use so I first

462
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:52,679
question I ask are you naive or not

463
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:55,079
naive it's a simple question

464
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,000
um so most of my patients are in the you

465
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,879
know 60 and above so most of them are

466
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,359
quite naive so I'll use this titration

467
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,760
schedule in patients who are naive I

468
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,279
start lower patients are not naive I

469
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,440
start higher and I may give a higher THC

470
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,359
comma if they're smoking it and I want

471
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,519
to switch over because people are

472
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,099
realizing that as much as we love our

473
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:21,139
cannabis there's got to be a way that we

474
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:24,538
can find better than smoking it

475
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:28,140
or or vaping it now vaping it has shown

476
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:30,599
to be less toxic to the lung than than

477
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,299
smoking and the literature has not come

478
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,159
out with cannabis smoking is associated

479
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:38,579
with a higher incidence of lung cancer

480
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,980
like it is with tobacco so so uh

481
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:43,319
probably because most people are not

482
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,819
smoking as much although you're inhaling

483
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,319
it deeper so I'm not sure that

484
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:49,079
literature is going to stand for a long

485
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,359
time we'll be we'll find out but you

486
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,480
remember I'm an oncologist too so I have

487
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,019
to respect that so cost Berry is the

488
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,240
major issue for me when I treat patients

489
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:02,819
uh I I I bring them back if they don't

490
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,859
come back I'll give them a call my staff

491
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:08,339
does and says why did you not come back

492
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:11,479
why didn't you go to the I stop I looked

493
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:13,918
at the istop which is that regulatory uh

494
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,259
state-run system that I know when they

495
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,660
pick up the opioids the benzodiazepines

496
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:20,339
or the Cannabis and they didn't go pick

497
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,679
it up and I asked him why didn't you do

498
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,779
it so the numbers are straightforward

499
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,480
then I looked at zip codes

500
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:29,579
I looked at all the people who could who

501
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,259
went and said I can't afford it I looked

502
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:34,139
at zip codes and do I have to tell you

503
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:36,058
what the ZIP code showed in my part of

504
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,700
the world Western New York the zip codes

505
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:40,859
were downtown Buffalo it was a it was

506
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,779
totally on income and race

507
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,979
which is why we put these systems

508
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:47,220
together

509
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,140
it's not working and I know that and I'm

510
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,179
in yeah I have a lot of meetings with

511
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,340
politicians to say look you put a system

512
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,440
together and it's just not working for

513
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:58,379
the population that we need to be more

514
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,058
cognizant of so the barrier says so this

515
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,900
is the article I recently wrote came out

516
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:06,000
in two years ago or now uh two and a

517
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,559
half yeah two years ago and it's

518
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,440
cannabis and migraine it's complicated

519
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:13,139
that would be I urge you to review that

520
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,179
so my conclusion is cannabis work

521
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,640
because they're anti-convulsive and the

522
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:20,700
reason I migraine is not a seizure but

523
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,159
migraine has ion channels uh as has

524
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,860
epilepsy so there may be a correlation

525
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,559
analgesic anti-matic anti-inflammatory

526
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:31,798
it's a it's a promising compound yes we

527
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,918
do need rad to my study uh I have a few

528
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:36,179
things here of

529
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,820
post-concussive headaches and chronic

530
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,400
pain and all I can tell you in this

531
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:42,839
study we've done the 80 showed

532
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,659
subjective Improvement on

533
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,980
post-concussive and chronic pain 80

534
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,659
percent of improvement with sleep

535
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,519
sending Improvement and and the

536
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:54,600
treatment I use usually is a 20 to 1

537
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:56,720
oral tincture which I titrate slowly and

538
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,719
then

539
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,159
and then this is this is something in

540
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:07,500
the in the in the uh opioid uh epidemic

541
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,559
uh we have right now which is a real

542
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,659
serious problem uh that has to be

543
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,399
addressed uh is that if you look at

544
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,679
opiate consumption

545
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,320
look at the different diseases TN is

546
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:22,220
trigeminal neuralgia uh these are the

547
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:24,480
decreased in amount of opioids they use

548
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,220
based on the different disease States

549
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,980
but across the board you'll see

550
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,440
especially fibromyalgia at 63 percent

551
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,179
come off opioids this is important

552
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,120
reduction of opiate consumption and

553
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,298
should be studied to the hilt especially

554
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:41,339
now in in the study now this was

555
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:44,519
interesting trigeminal neuralgia another

556
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:47,240
pain syndrome lancetting pain and this

557
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:49,259
the results are really unbelievable 81

558
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,940
reported significant subjective

559
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:53,400
improvements so I'm going to go by

560
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,860
fibromyalgia anxiety I'm gonna go that

561
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,980
wherever the art of medicine is love

562
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:01,199
there's a lot of humanity Hippocrates

563
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,538

564
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,840
