1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,250
thank you very much for having stayed

2
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:11,500
that long it's definitely the better

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,019
choice you would be just stuck in

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:19,869
traffic so now you're stuck with me and

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:24,119
we are enjoying process chemistry so we

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:28,080
talked so much about the plant genetics

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:31,390
the chemo profiles of the cannabis and

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,109
then the cancer effects anti-cancer

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:37,689
effects and other medical effects but

10
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:39,820
I'm the Loney chemist Wow one of the few

11
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:41,920
chemists up here and I just wanted to

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,799
point out it's not as easy to just say

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,579
if OD Kosh works that's the one that

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,498
treats your indication and to make this

15
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,628
point that there is a little bit more to

16
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:56,079
the whole production pipeline than just

17
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:59,558
like strain and then you're good with

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,128
the medical outcome I just want to show

19
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:05,890
what all happens during these steps for

20
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:09,390
that I bastardized one of the discs

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:13,468
anomic present a graphical

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:18,359
representations because up here I

23
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:21,449
devised this kind of visualization and

24
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:24,188
here in the middle the middle circle

25
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,200
shows us which cannabinoids are present

26
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:32,798
so the blue ones are THC the red ones

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,109
are CBD so this shows the ratio and the

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,840
diameter of that circle is how much

29
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:41,140
there is the total concentration and the

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,270
same counts for the terpenes just pon

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,920
different point of view out and it's not

32
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,810
important to really remember which

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,759
cannabinoids which color and which

34
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,679
doping is which color it's just

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,140
important to just understand the basics

36
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:55,539
like ratio and the diameter is your

37
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,009
concentration I will also not

38
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,868
concentrate on cultivation or

39
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,390
formulation because they are not my

40
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:07,209
fields of expertise and we talked about

41
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:10,899
that enough over the last few days so we

42
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:13,209
do see different strains different

43
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,759
cultivars offer different chemical

44
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,040
profiles on the cannabinoid side not so

45
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,239
much because there as it was pointed out

46
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,250
in a recent paper

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,300
is actually not much difference thanks

48
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,389
to being able to test for THC all

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,310
cultivars in California and our high THC

50
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:31,929
if there was the greatest idea we are

51
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,360
not really sure but there is still a

52
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,870
large variation in the terpene profiles

53
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,590
and as you can see you have different

54
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,319
dominant terpenes here's the yellow

55
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,250
that's limonene then that's that's

56
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,219
Mersin and here the orange one is better

57
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,849
clarify lean but you also see them in

58
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:56,259
different concentrations so and that

59
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,849
there is a difference and terbium

60
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:02,799
profiles we saw on the talk yesterday

61
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:04,299
about this this omics and there's also a

62
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,260
very nice paper that talks about the

63
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,210
chemical chemo vas by Fischer dick but

64
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:12,219
again my focus is on what happens

65
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,290
between you grow it and then you

66
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:16,240
actually give it to your patient and I

67
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:18,459
just wanted to point out it might be

68
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,370
obvious but some people might forget

69
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,260
about this too is the way you draw your

70
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,719
plant actually he controls how much

71
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:28,299
terpenes there is so you don't have much

72
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,430
effect on the cannabinoids itself but if

73
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,230
you do the fast dry like hey I dry and

74
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,659
in four days and then I go on you lose

75
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:37,359
most of your terpenes and you have to

76
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:40,389
control the conditions in your drying

77
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,330
room to really control what is left on

78
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:47,250
the plant in the terpene on the terpene

79
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:50,650
side and we can take that further

80
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,620
depending on which atmosphere you store

81
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:57,159
the cannabinoid or the cannabis itself

82
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,780
you again you affect the concentrations

83
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,689
the amounts of terpenes the

84
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,390
concentrations of cannabinoids and even

85
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:07,169
the ratio of terpenes so if you look at

86
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:09,639
this here this is blue yellow grey green

87
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,859
which is the same here but if you change

88
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,829
the gaseous now we have instead the gray

89
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,780
we have a blue in here and I really

90
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,759
can't remember which happens they were

91
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:22,059
but the point is we are changing the

92
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,029
terpene profile so that is good and bad

93
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,160
for one if you wanted something to be

94
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:31,918
stable don't change your gases but if

95
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:36,509
you want to be more an artisan approach

96
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:38,668
- to really modulate the flavor or the

97
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:42,150
terpene profile you can do this you can

98
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:43,769
also use all these aspects to compensate

99
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,899
for any variance that might come out

100
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:48,689
from the grow maybe your lights were off

101
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,098
for a day or you had a hail day more

102
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:54,029
properly then it's all dead but if it

103
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:56,939
rained for example too much so and this

104
00:04:54,029 --> 00:05:00,809
is just in the drying and curing aspect

105
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:02,399
of the cannabis plant then my main field

106
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,009
of research has been on the extraction

107
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,168
side so if we just pick one of the of

108
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,210
the cured strains and we take them along

109
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:13,198
protip if you want to extract on cue

110
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:16,250
it's just a waste of time but for the

111
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,770
extraction part it even makes a

112
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,418
difference how you mill different

113
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:23,430
milling methods will give you different

114
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:26,189
extracts if you keep everything else the

115
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,038
same and I want to point out the food

116
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:30,360
blender here because you can't just say

117
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,818
oh I'm millet and then we are good

118
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,370
compared to whole flan because at 2

119
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,860
millimeters we get this basic best yield

120
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,348
out and if you do a food blender which

121
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,509
gives you a very imprecise very particle

122
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:45,449
size it will be all over the place and

123
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:48,598
if you care about efficiencies that's

124
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:50,460
definitely not the way to go and then in

125
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,860
the extraction itself and here I just

126
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,168
show that for supercritical co2

127
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,449
extraction you can really modulate what

128
00:05:55,168 --> 00:06:00,240
you extract I can pick out just the

129
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:02,550
terpenes I can pick out just the neutral

130
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,490
cannabinoids the THC here or I can

131
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,939
extract a THC acid so the acid form and

132
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:12,389
have that one relatively purified or

133
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:15,959
enriched so you can't even go like oh

134
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:18,269
you took sour cush and extracted it with

135
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,158
co2 you still don't know what you

136
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:23,250
actually go out and you can't go from

137
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:24,839
one vendor to the next they properly

138
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,098
don't use the same methods so you can

139
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:31,709
play with that but it's a as an extract

140
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:34,079
I myself I can now still use that to

141
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:36,288
play and modulate so what does the

142
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,818
doctor want what does the patient need

143
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:40,918
what variants did I get out of the Grove

144
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:44,129
what do I need to buffer and the same I

145
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,269
can actually do with CBD versus THC

146
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:48,600
extraction

147
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:52,799
they do have different solubilities in

148
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,290
co2 so I can now play with that ratio we

149
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,680
know from all these key move our studies

150
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:02,490
that this cannabis cultivars mostly

151
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,759
extract exclusive tier Express mostly

152
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,079
THC mostly CVD or one-to-one mixture in

153
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,050
the middle but if you want a three to

154
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,379
one from a cultivar you can do that if

155
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,900
you play with your extraction conditions

156
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:19,409
and for the hemp people if you need to

157
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:21,179
suppress your THC amount there is a

158
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,860
method there's a way doing that in the

159
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,900
extract and not having to deal with it

160
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:32,220
afterwards so okay now we're done right

161
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:34,439
unfortunately not because normally you

162
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:39,930
post process or most people will post

163
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:41,490
process the material and the general

164
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,240
thing that is done is decarboxylation

165
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:48,840
and i've seen it in person

166
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,060
far too often you go in an extraction

167
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,039
room and they have like these two liter

168
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,160
five liter beakers on a hot plate and

169
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,439
it's just bubbling away and so ask them

170
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,189
so how long does that go and they're

171
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:05,370
like yeah two three hours

172
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:07,800
not really that precise so we did some

173
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,810
research on like process analytics to

174
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,759
actually track that in real time how it

175
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,040
carboxylates but one of the big

176
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,439
takeaways was if you do decarboxylation

177
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,689
on the air you have oxygen you have heat

178
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,870
there's a lot of stuff that's going on

179
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:25,350
and in my case here when you do it under

180
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,050
air yeah you get your THC decarboxylated

181
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,439
but you also get delta ath see there's a

182
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:35,220
cbn and then there is a plethora of

183
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,259
stuff that you don't know like they are

184
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,279
currently known analytical methods that

185
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,319
can tell you what it is

186
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,669
well i'd made the people high it looks

187
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,680
clear so we're good but so far we don't

188
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:48,870
even know so i would recommend doing

189
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,389
that in under an inert atmosphere so

190
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,980
here x amplified by co2 there's an

191
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:55,970
oxygen presence so you don't get all

192
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,289
these wild and side reactions and

193
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,070
talking about side reactions that is

194
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:01,259
still possible

195
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,320
new distillation apparatus if you're

196
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,720
good in distilling you kill these few

197
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,790
percentage of THC a and maybe some other

198
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,589
minor cannabinoids and get rid of all

199
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,649
the flavor and you have like really nice

200
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,660
clear pure THC which we just saw on the

201
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:18,870
talk before isn't maybe not the thing

202
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,939
you should use anyway but if you don't

203
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,269
really know how to extract and you just

204
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:27,149
think Lee is king you get all these

205
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:29,310
other things that are currently still I

206
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:36,419
unidentified but at least they make you

207
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:38,099
high so so it's just boggles my mind as

208
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:40,500
a chemist like they don't know what

209
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,620
they're doing and like most people don't

210
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,889
seem to really care but we really need

211
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,068
to to think about this processing step

212
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:54,810
also on a very specific and organized

213
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:56,639
method and I said where I'm not talking

214
00:09:54,809 --> 00:10:00,539
about formulation I just want to do one

215
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,278
case study we have a patient so most all

216
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:04,139
of this research was done at outcault in

217
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,049
San Diego it's a fully vertically

218
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:09,899
integrated dispensary so we do see

219
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:12,240
patients and we had a patient in his mid

220
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:16,129
30s and he had about eight seizures a

221
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,139
day and the mother was at the end of her

222
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,909
hope everything else then classical

223
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:24,209
medications didn't work so she comes to

224
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:27,179
us and wasn't sure that she really wants

225
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:29,429
to do it is tea cannabis it's weird and

226
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:34,198
at some point she's like okay we try it

227
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:37,559
so she takes a bus this CBD THC tincture

228
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:39,359
with a 1 to 3 ratio 40 milligrams per

229
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,328
milliliter no terpenes because I do

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,938
remove them mainly for flavor aspects

231
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:47,159
out of my extract first and then MCT

232
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:51,208
also medium chain triglycerides from

233
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:53,448
coconut oil distillate and the patient

234
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:57,059
basically went seizure free for weeks

235
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:58,679
like a so then the mother comes back and

236
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,049
by Stan ice next bottle when it's empty

237
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,138
and it's the same bottle the three to

238
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:07,769
one oil and the she sees us we start

239
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:10,079
immediately and like she's freaking out

240
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:13,139
they in the dispensary freaking out

241
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,509
and this was

242
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:19,110
earlier this year so I had seen

243
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:22,919
professor Dini Mary's talk last year at

244
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:26,820
Harvard and I was like yes I was waiting

245
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:29,809
for this case because we changed

246
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,850
Kim OVA because we ran out of diamond OG

247
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:35,639
so we use lemonade haze but we

248
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:40,259
formulated it exactly to the same

249
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:43,049
concentrations and the patient ceases

250
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:46,289
again so we scrap together all the

251
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:47,879
leftover diamond OG give that to the

252
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,939
patient and the patient is seizure free

253
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,399
again so now I'm sitting there and it's

254
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,680
like that's awesome

255
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,190
and I have until Christmas because then

256
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:02,338
we are out so I look at this and okay so

257
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,230
CBD THC is exactly the same my

258
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,640
formulation scientists actually can do

259
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,209
his job and waste the materials

260
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,519
correctly we look at the acid forms of

261
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:15,028
the cannabinoids and they are kind of

262
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,149
the same we even look down our list of

263
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:21,838
tested molecules they're cbn present CVG

264
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:23,850
present THC V present and you can't

265
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,520
really say there is a difference and and

266
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:31,350
then it's CVG and CBC we do see a

267
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:33,539
present or absence but thanks to the

268
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,370
talks we saw before and that might still

269
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:38,578
not be the right answer but that's where

270
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,919
my analytics end i right now I have no

271
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:42,958
access to further analytics and I'm

272
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,669
definitely not going to fractionate my

273
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,739
oils and going to try that on the one

274
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:48,778
patient if it works or doesn't I'm not

275
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:54,480
going to do that like 20 different oils

276
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:55,919
let's see what works but it just we are

277
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,629
we are here at this conference and we

278
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,639
are already happy and yes cannabis works

279
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:05,669
it's great but it might not be as easy

280
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,870
we we should consider all the steps in

281
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:08,789
between and there might be hard and I

282
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,600
might be boring like I'm a chemist like

283
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:14,219
that kills the party normally but but

284
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,840
now when I tell them what I do I own

285
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:25,420
this party

286
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:26,920
but I like do you bring samples so we we

287
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:28,589
shouldn't get ahead of ourselves like

288
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:32,079
yeah cancer cures everything

289
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:34,780
cannabis cures everything what cancer

290
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,820
does you're dead and don't care but so

291
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,799
cannabis cures everything like don't

292
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,600
don't let's not do it that easy we still

293
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,629
have to you have a long way ahead of

294
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,340
ourselves and I was talking to a

295
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:47,740
formulation scientist recently and she's

296
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,290
like yeah we are born in the 1930s with

297
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,259
the progress that's currently there like

298
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:55,629
we have a few decades to catch up to the

299
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:57,669
other industries so I have to thank

300
00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:01,090
everyone I worked with so I worked or

301
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:03,939
work at outcall for now the dispensary

302
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:06,070
in San Diego that does all the work and

303
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,200
gives me all the material on these

304
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:12,100
optimization studies where you saw the

305
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:15,640
few disks that's about ten kilos or

306
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:18,519
twenty pounds of weed per disc just to

307
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:22,120
get the data points so that's a lot of

308
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,500
stuff but it makes it money back

309
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,139
afterwards and so then the other

310
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,700
companies we worked with is Nate for the

311
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:30,189
controls in the drawing room

312
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,550
Henkel Minh was for the gases and the

313
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,680
curing fridge is the milling study apex

314
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:39,279
is all the extraction work PerkinElmer

315
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:43,559
was the work we did for process

316
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:47,079
analytics and we did make it to the end

317
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:50,229
what I want to point out is I'm getting

318
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,930
kind of frustrated with like these

319
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:57,039
things we currently do and don't do yet

320
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:58,029
and can't do so therefore I wanted to

321
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,409
mention that earlier you don't actually

322
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:02,309
have to take pictures of it because I'll

323
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:04,779
upload everything on SlideShare and

324
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:07,389
otherwise if you have any questions or

325
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:12,129
want to do any collaborations please

326
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:15,009
find me there there are votes next month

327
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:17,559
I can't I'm German I'm heading to Canada

328
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:20,610

329
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,609
me there thank you

330
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:32,259
we have time for a couple questions if

331
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:34,509
you like I just clarify with those two

332
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:36,730
preparations were you fortifying with

333
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:38,769
isolated compounds to reach those equals

334
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:42,039
three-to-one levels we fortified with

335
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:44,949
CBD isolate yes we only grow THC strains

336
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,809
so we used isolated CBD and are you

337
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:50,680
aware if the patient has had a chance to

338
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:53,739
try CBG or CB GA I have no access to

339
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:56,699
that purified so I can't offer that

340
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,700
great thank you

341
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:06,338
