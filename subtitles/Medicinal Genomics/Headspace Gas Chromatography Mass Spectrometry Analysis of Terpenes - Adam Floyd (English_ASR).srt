1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,219
good afternoon everybody my name is Adam

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,509
Floyd I'm a field application scientists

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:11,939
with PerkinElmer and today I'm gonna

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:15,809
talk about three of my favorite subjects

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:19,230
which are cannabis gas chromatography

6
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:21,539
and mass spectrometry so I'm going to

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,839
talk for about 20 minutes 25 minutes and

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,890
then we'll have some time for questions

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,618
so I've worked in the cannabis industry

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,279
about eleven years has spent a lot of

11
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:35,850
time doing research on cannabis it's a

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,250
personal fascination of mine and I think

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,840
that some of the most interesting

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:45,269
chemistry that takes place in the plant

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,430
is with the terpenes so to begin with

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,289
why do we care about terpenes why is

17
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:54,890
this interesting well I always like in

18
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,079
the cannabis experience to drinking wine

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,808
you don't go out and buy a 200 dollar

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,509
bottle of wine because it has 15%

21
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,280
alcohol in it right so for the longest

22
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:08,219
time in the beginning of the industry it

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,909
was all about THC concentration THC

24
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,920
concentration

25
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:16,830
well THC is not necessarily what causes

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,439
all of these sort of residual entourage

27
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:23,188
effects right it's not what makes the

28
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,228
user experience interesting just like

29
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:27,508
you wouldn't judge wine by its alcohol

30
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:31,400
content you shouldn't judge your

31
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,438
cannabis flour by its THC concentration

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,840
so I says very interesting statement

33
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,179
from SC labs awhile ago where they had

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,000
tested all of the different winning

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,060
cannabis crop strains and the winners

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,709
sort of unanimously had very unique and

37
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,600
interesting profiles

38
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,509
which I thought was pretty fascinating

39
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,280
so they did all the testing and across

40
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,159
the board the THC concentration was

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,790
relatively in the same but the winners

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,270
really had this very sort of fascinating

43
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,270
terpene profile

44
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,709
well so in the cannabis flower there's

45
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:13,370
you know depending on you you talk to

46
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:15,409
you anywhere from 140 to 250 different

47
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,939
terpenes that are present I don't know

48
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:18,979
that there's really necessarily

49
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:22,280
consensus about that but there's a lot

50
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:25,189
so I often say 200 because it's right in

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,360
the middle so I get both sides to agree

52
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:32,629
with me

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:34,850
the science of testing for you know

54
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:37,909
really anything in cannabis has evolved

55
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:41,439
so much in the last 10 years or so and

56
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:45,199
so to see this evolution particularly in

57
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,989
terpene analysis is it's pretty amazing

58
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:52,609
right so we're gonna go through some

59
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:54,920
methodologies now and then I'm gonna

60
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,280
talk a little bit about the chemistry of

61
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:02,059
cannabis and sort of the science of

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,340
doing this testing so first of all so

63
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,759
terpenes are secondary metabolites

64
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:11,799
they're produced to the NBA and mep

65
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:15,139
pathways this is also follows the

66
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:19,790
cannabinoid synthase in in the cannabis

67
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:22,369
plant they are built from these 5 unit

68
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:24,229
carbon molecules called isoprene their

69
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,659
designation is a monitor being a

70
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:29,828
diterpene sequester terpene these are

71
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:34,519
all indicated by the number of 5 unit

72
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:39,379
isoprene molecules that make up their

73
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:41,780
their structure I talked about this a

74
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:44,539
minute ago a little bit the entourage

75
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:50,150
effect which is sort of the secondary

76
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:53,899
body high that you experience while you

77
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,659
consume cannabis right so people talk a

78
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,640
lot about how certain strains make them

79
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:02,120
feel sleepy or certain strains make them

80
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,059
feel paranoid or or bring euphoria about

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,359
though because of this metabolic

82
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,199
production it's not much of a far leap

83
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,980
to assume that there is interaction

84
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,229
significant interaction with

85
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:19,250
endocannabinoids system and these

86
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:22,639
molecules so there seems to be a lot of

87
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:26,180
strong evidence that it goes beyond just

88
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,490
sort of a flavor experience right so

89
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,410
some people really love like this you

90
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,759
know purple Oracle is amazing like it

91
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,189
tastes so good it makes me feel this

92
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,379
certain way and then why does this other

93
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:39,259
one make me feel paranoid and negative

94
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:41,269
and so it's you know there's a lot of

95
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,839
research that's being done to sort of

96
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:46,879
quantify these specific physiological

97
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,319
responses and I think in the coming

98
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:53,689
years you're gonna see a lot of that

99
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:57,050
research point back to terpenes now

100
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:59,930
we're gonna jump into the analysis of

101
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:04,009
terpenes typically this is done by gas

102
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,530
chromatography you can also do it using

103
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:09,740
liquid chromatography but as it's a

104
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:13,698
volatile compounds gas chromatography is

105
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,189
really more appropriate for this this is

106
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:19,910
the setup that we use so I'll get into

107
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:20,870
why I love headspace so much but for

108
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,570
those of you don't know this is a

109
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,939
headspace sampling system middle

110
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:30,969
instruments a gas chromatograph and then

111
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,969
we use mass spectrometry for detection

112
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,348
so before we do any detection we got to

113
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:38,779
get our samples ready now those of you

114
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:42,949
who have testing labs in California and

115
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:45,859
understand the very convoluted ECC

116
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:48,409
regulations they state that we have to

117
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,120
use 500 milligrams of samples so one of

118
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,220
the benefits of headspace is that you

119
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,280
can actually analyze your sample

120
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,780
directly now if I take 500 milligrams of

121
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,788
cannabis and I put it in a headspace

122
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,279
file all of my peaks are going to be

123
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:06,348
saturated so we have to do a dilution

124
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:10,029
and that's purely regulated by you know

125
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:10,029
the state state regulations

126
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,859
one of the downsides of doing this too

127
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,870
is it like as you well know every form

128
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,780
every matrix of cannabis that you can

129
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,750
think of exists in some form right so

130
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,568
just because you have a method that

131
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,819
works strictly for flour like I can take

132
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,319
my flour and put it in there and there's

133
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,110
not a tremendous amount of matrix

134
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,120
effects if I take oil and put that in a

135
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,550
headspace file and analyze it there may

136
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,550
be significant matrix effects so doing

137
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,879
an extraction is beneficial for all the

138
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,280
different types of matrices that you see

139
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,500
out in the market so we take these 500

140
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,788
milligrams we put it into a sample vial

141
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,819
we shake it up we crush it into powder

142
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:58,680
so use milled beads or agitation and so

143
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,330
once the ground it's it's ground

144
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,810
sufficiently sometimes people we use

145
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:07,639
cryo Mills or they'll just shake it then

146
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:10,530
we use IPA or methanol depending on

147
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,478
which solvent you prefer and we do a

148
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,309
fill the volume to 10 mils and then we

149
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,519
take a 20 micro litre extraction from

150
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,870
that put it into a headspace file and we

151
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,028
do what's called total evaporative

152
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:25,918
analysis so everything in that headspace

153
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:28,500
file is in the gas phase again here's a

154
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,329
small example of the number of matrices

155
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,870
that you see out in the market Oh

156
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:35,038
butane extract which we've always asked

157
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,050
me they go do you have an SOP for

158
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,509
extracts and well okay you take a look

159
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,340
at butter right it's structurally and

160
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:45,000
chemically much different than a butane

161
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:47,549
extract versus a co2 extract so no I

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,129
don't have 800 different SOPs for you

163
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,990
know sample extraction but we have some

164
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,990
general ones that that work pretty well

165
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:59,689
you know I've seen dog treats and

166
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,038
lotions and toothpicks and every sort of

167
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:05,120
cannabis product that you can imagine

168
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,120
has come through our labs

169
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,900
traditionally and I did this for ten

170
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,879
years before I started working heavily

171
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,789
with headspace we would do liquid

172
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,740
injection so you have to do an

173
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,540
extraction you pull out one microliter

174
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,160
whatever your sample volume is and you

175
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,040
drive it directly into the injection

176
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,380
port the problem is is that cannabis is

177
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,330
incredibly dirty right there's over a

178
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:31,170
thousand compounds found in cannabis you

179
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:34,799
have waxes and lipids THC right 20 plus

180
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:36,600
percent THC 8090 percent THC in certain

181
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,659
extracts so you have this huge

182
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:44,670
concentration of other analytes right so

183
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:47,490
the advantage of using head spaces that

184
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:50,639
we largely leave most of that stuff in

185
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,620
the vial right so we can dictate a

186
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,840
specific temperature at which we're

187
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,879
bringing this vial up and doing our

188
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,769
injection so anything with a boiling

189
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,830
point below that stays in our vial

190
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:04,319
everything with a boiling point that we

191
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:08,190
want to look at is in the gas phase and

192
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,760
we can do an injection so you can see

193
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,710
here this is contamination right so we

194
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,909
actually don't even use a glass wool

195
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,350
liner in our injection port but if you

196
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:21,990
do liquid injection you have to do that

197
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:25,830
so here's an example of your line or

198
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,899
after seven injections you're changing

199
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,550
those liners a lot so it's in the

200
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,889
maintenance that goes along with liquid

201
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:33,870
injection can be very problematic there

202
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:37,439
is certain advantages to it but

203
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,049
headspace really is hugely advantageous

204
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,010
I have been Taoiseach

205
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:43,469
although I'm not going to discuss it in

206
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:45,120
this presentation you also can do this

207
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,810
for residual to solvent analysis in fact

208
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,860
you can run residual solvent analysis

209
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:51,959
simultaneously with terpene analysis

210
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:58,080
which wouldn't necessarily be possible

211
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:59,790
or practical with liquid injection so

212
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,560
here's an example right so a lot of

213
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:08,219
flower research is done with threat with

214
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:10,829
direct analysis so I can take a sample

215
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,230
and can put it in headspace file bring

216
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,790
it up into the oven and I get all of

217
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,370
those volatile compounds to come off so

218
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:20,039
this technology is used

219
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:23,399
an environmental analysis when they look

220
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,289
at like VOCs in water or soil they're

221
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,720
able to analyze those samples directly

222
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:29,819
which is fantastic except there's so

223
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,950
much analyte that we want to look at in

224
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,980
our cannabis sample it makes it very

225
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,420
problematic right so terpenes depending

226
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,259
on the strain you're looking at three to

227
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:41,819
five six percent by weight of this you

228
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:43,319
know of our target analyte which is

229
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,850
significant you don't want to shoot that

230
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,450
onto your column it's gonna totally

231
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,430
overload your mass spec although it is

232
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,160
very advantageous for things like gummy

233
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:56,009
bears or lotion which are hard to

234
00:10:53,159 --> 00:11:01,319
extract and that matrix does work well

235
00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:03,299
in headspace analysis it things like

236
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,250
oils you can tend to get very poor

237
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,469
recoveries depending on the analyte so

238
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,720
heavy boilers like alpha visible though

239
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,970
tends to not want to come out of these

240
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,740
viscous oils so I did this very cool

241
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:18,120
research product a project where we got

242
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:21,029
certified reference material from

243
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,409
emerald scientific and ran all sorts of

244
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,909
different tests all sorts of different

245
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:25,860
extracts to sort of look at the

246
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:28,799
extraction efficiencies of these

247
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,600
different analytes so these heavy

248
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,079
boilers we were getting about 10 percent

249
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,710
recovery from a direct analysis and then

250
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:42,030
we did a DMA methanol extraction and we

251
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:46,100
were up to 90 percent recovery so here's

252
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:50,789
a slide showing sort of the theory of

253
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:55,070
headspace analysis so for example if

254
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:59,039
we're looking at terpenes you can run

255
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:01,379
your headspace at 130 140 degrees see

256
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,860
anything that has a boiling point above

257
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:06,269
that is going to stay in your vial so

258
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,879
when we do our injection from the

259
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:10,710
headspace of the of the vial all that

260
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,769
stuff is left behind it's ultimately a

261
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:16,200
much cleaner analysis

262
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:17,879
now in California we do this total

263
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,940
evaporative analysis it's also called

264
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:25,620
total evaporative technique where we are

265
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:30,000
doing an extraction and we spike either

266
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:33,740
10 20 40 microliters of analyte into our

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,879
vial so this is a very useful technique

268
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,129
particularly because in your headspace

269
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,870
unit you can dictate how long you're

270
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:41,730
making your injection so you can adjust

271
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,379
your sample volume so if I want to

272
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,690
inject more sample onto the column

273
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:47,850
increase my detection limits I'm able to

274
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:52,190
do that there's other problems that come

275
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:58,500
with that but it is a flexible

276
00:12:52,190 --> 00:13:01,140
methodology now for a long time terpenes

277
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,139
were traditionally analyzed using GCF ID

278
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:07,860
so a flame ionization detector detector

279
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:12,120
but as sort of the science of cannabis

280
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:16,740
and terpene analysis as evolved it sort

281
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,440
of creates this ambiguous analysis so if

282
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,370
you're trying to analyze a hundred and

283
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,830
forty different types of analytes using

284
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,840
an F IDs not really practical so the

285
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:31,080
people that I know that run it their run

286
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,170
time is 6070 minutes all right so our

287
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,800
run time for our twenty one terpene

288
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:39,779
method is nine minutes so your about

289
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:42,569
your more than six times more efficient

290
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:46,620
using a mass spectrometer also you're

291
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:51,629
able to get spectral data which is very

292
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:53,220
useful in determining what terpenes I'm

293
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:55,350
looking for so if I want to look at

294
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:00,690
unusual terpenes you've got to have this

295
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:03,060
a mass spec generally for production

296
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,370
style labs we do either twenty one or

297
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,889
forty two of the most common terpenes

298
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,419
was generally there's about seventeen

299
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:13,799
that people really tend to care about

300
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:16,379
and in more research settings we can you

301
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:19,229
know add a ton more I know of an

302
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:22,529
individual that runs a 70 minute method

303
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,090
to test for 140 terpenes which is not

304
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,289
always practical right if you're in a

305
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,660
production style and by

306
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:29,849
you're not gonna run 18 samples a day it

307
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,578
just doesn't make sense but we tend to

308
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,579
you know step back and focus on these

309
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:37,019
particular terpenes that people sort of

310
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:41,309
care about you see them a lot in

311
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:45,110
labeling well here's a chromatogram from

312
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:48,299
our 42 terpene analysis there's been

313
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:52,409
right around 200 terpenes identified

314
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:54,599
lots of sort of cool and unusual ones i

315
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:58,500
spent a lot of time doing research on

316
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:02,720
terpenes before I started doing this job

317
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:05,970
so we were looking at manipulation of

318
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,750
turpenoid production in cannabis right

319
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:12,720
so the idea is if I could always create

320
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:16,169
sort of these amazing strains of

321
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,528
cannabis it would be I mean that product

322
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:21,240
would fly off the shelves right so you

323
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,789
know if I could turn $2 bottle of wine

324
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,839
into a hundred dollar bottle of wine

325
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:27,419
relatively easily right if I could

326
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,970
always create these fascinating and

327
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:32,549
amazing terpene profiles from my plants

328
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:39,120
in a consistent way I would be hugely

329
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:42,028
beneficial the terpenes are very easy to

330
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,470
calibrate and very difficult to truly

331
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:48,269
measure and the problem is that they

332
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,879
share masses right so they're

333
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:53,519
structurally very similar they're all

334
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:58,708
built out of these five carbon isoprene

335
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:02,549
units so you see very similar masses 121

336
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:05,338
136 93 69 is present in most of these

337
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:08,818
terpenes so if you have Co eluting Peaks

338
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:11,939
in fi d you're just gonna see a single

339
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:16,919
peak you're not able to isolate those by

340
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:20,278
mass and mass ratio we usually do a

341
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:22,828
calibration from about 2 ppm all the way

342
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,438
up to anywhere from five hundred a

343
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:27,688
thousand they tend to be pretty linear

344
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:30,289
across this range if you're looking at

345
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:33,088
rare unusual terpenes you can go lower

346
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:36,179
they tend to make just beautiful looking

347
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:38,310
calibration curves which is really

348
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:39,149
pretty nice but then you have to sort of

349
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:41,159
sort through

350
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:44,789
this massive amount of data that comes

351
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,980
back there's not really a catch-all

352
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:52,490
method that's easy to analyze for

353
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:55,050
potentially 200 analytes what are the

354
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,299
one of the problems to with running

355
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:59,250
these kind of analysis is that you get

356
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,929
all these matrix effects like we talked

357
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,850
about earlier and I talked a little bit

358
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:05,220
about a research project that I did

359
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,610
looking at these and the oils seem to be

360
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:12,179
particularly problematic there's

361
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:14,789
something about you know there's some

362
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,230
chemistry which they love to bind to

363
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:18,808
these heavily boilers so you get like

364
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,789
beautiful recoveries from the first part

365
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:26,578
of your run and then at the end they

366
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:28,678
just drop down to nothing so I've run

367
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,730
through those of you in California and I

368
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,830
don't know if anybody's going through

369
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:36,029
validation right now but it is not a

370
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:38,339
particularly fun experience I've gotten

371
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:42,420
through validation a couple times with

372
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:44,659
different labs and doing with with

373
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,789
terpenes and and residual solvents but

374
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:50,850
focused now on terpenes so you

375
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:53,970
they typically include running precision

376
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:57,089
actors the matrix spike recovery LOD loq

377
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,500
so this stuff is the terpenes tend to

378
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:02,909
recover pretty well particularly with

379
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:08,700
flour again a little more problematic

380
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:12,960
with running oils but we have ways

381
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:16,580
around that again here's some data that

382
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,779
we ran for for precision and linearity

383
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:21,000
so we run these two different writes so

384
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:23,579
we run a spec standard 42 terpenes and

385
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,259
res Dex standard which is 21 and then

386
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:28,039
depending on the lab and their needs

387
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:30,058
sometimes they will add in individual

388
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:32,009
terpenes so I get this question all the

389
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,259
time like how many triplet terpenes can

390
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,910
you analyze for well how many terpenes

391
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,470
do you wanting and Alessa for how many

392
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,679
calibration curves do you want to have

393
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:45,049
right that that number is you know it

394
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:48,710
goes on as long as you you want it to

395
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:51,200
so in closing you know headspace gas

396
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,000
chromatography mass spectrometry really

397
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,009
is the cleanest most effective technique

398
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,039
to analyze cannabis cannabis products

399
00:18:55,009 --> 00:19:00,440
for terpenes I've had customers run for

400
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,170
multiple years without cleaning or

401
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,750
changing their columns which I suggest

402
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:09,980
that you don't do but it certainly can

403
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:14,720
be done it's sort of a testament to how

404
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,700
clean this process can be I have some

405
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,789
digital copies of application notes

406
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,590
relating to this that are available so

407
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:23,299
after the presentation if you want me to

408
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:25,699
send you one I can give you my card and

409
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,509
if you have any questions or comments

410
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,690
afterwards

411
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:33,410
don't catch me you can contact me at

412
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,029
Adam dot Floyd at PerkinElmer comm and a

413
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,580
special thanks to the PerkinElmer

414
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:40,700
cannabis team and Lee and Tom for for

415
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:43,579
helping me with all of this so I think I

416
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,529
talked a little too fast and flew

417
00:19:43,579 --> 00:20:00,740
through my presentation so we got time

418
00:19:45,529 --> 00:20:04,609
for some questions if anybody has any so

419
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:06,740
I have a question I'm over here Hey

420
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:09,049
so you indicated that in the plaint you

421
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,420
see about one percent total terpenes in

422
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:13,309
there when you're working with

423
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,440
commercial vape oils

424
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:18,379
what's a range of percentages you

425
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,850
routinely see so in Flour we typically

426
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,710
submit to see between one and five

427
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:24,259
depending on the strain and in

428
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:29,180
commercial base oil you see between 0%

429
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:31,670
and 60% 60 yeah I mean the range is

430
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,740
significant right so when you look at

431
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:38,710
food right so if they prepare like co2

432
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:41,809
oil there tends to not like when you are

433
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,880
formulating oils into cannabis products

434
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,970
like brownies you don't want it to taste

435
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,640
like a bud right so they tend to remove

436
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,500
all the terpenes and so it's just pure

437
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,860
ice

438
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:57,250
but you can see in certain extracts you

439
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:58,839
know 20 plus percent is not uncommon and

440
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,730
what just one follow-up question do you

441
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:04,509
see a difference in the terpene profile

442
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:07,750
if you extract it by butane versus co2

443
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:11,950
versus ethanol yeah absolutely so all

444
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:15,759
three of those have different capacities

445
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:19,150
to solving terpenes what do you think is

446
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:22,000
the best way to protect the terpenes so

447
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:24,130
butane extracts tend to be the highest

448
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,589
concentrations from from my experience

449
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,690
right so ethanol is problematic you can

450
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:31,538
pull aurifil and a lot of other things

451
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:35,288
out with ethanol but due to the

452
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:38,529
hydrocarbon nature of a butane you do

453
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:40,629
see tend to I think that it preserves

454
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:43,569
what they call sort of the keema bar or

455
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:48,100
the chemical fingerprint of the plan the

456
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:49,750
best thanks hope you're welcome I am

457
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,759
thanks for the information

458
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,548
first westbrook here from emerald

459
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,220
scientific the last round the spring

460
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:59,259
round of the proficiency test the

461
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,230
interlaboratory comparison component

462
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,099
showed quite a bit more deviation and

463
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,329
quantification of terpenes than we'd

464
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:07,000
like to cease but especially

465
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:11,740
acknowledging the importance of these

466
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,288
compounds in the in the outcome it's

467
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,880
there's there's been some conversation

468
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:18,038
speculation about what the industry can

469
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,690
do to improve it and obviously I think

470
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,669
these kinds of conversations go a long

471
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,830
way towards that I'm curious if you

472
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:27,490
think that simple runtimes

473
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:30,788
versus labs profitability and come into

474
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,650
play in an equation like this yeah so

475
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:36,548
that's always you know there's this

476
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:38,919
difficult contrast between doing really

477
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:41,589
really good science and making money

478
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,990
right so production labs they have a big

479
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:47,199
overhead they don't have the luxury to

480
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,990
run a 70 minute method so I do think

481
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,659
that that is partially problematic so

482
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:55,808
from from my experience with the the

483
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:57,669
Emerald Beatty tests they they come in

484
00:22:55,808 --> 00:23:00,670
an oil-based matrix which is very

485
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:03,550
difficult to efficiently extract

486
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,320
so I think that you know I've done a lot

487
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:09,700
of research with different combinations

488
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:14,980
of extraction solvents and I think that

489
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:18,910
there is one that is generally the most

490
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,470
efficient at pulling the most of the you

491
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,090
know the majority of these compounds out

492
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,980
of this play alright so if you do a

493
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:26,409
strict methanol extraction and oil

494
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,839
you'll see about a ten percent recovery

495
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:31,090
ten to fifteen percent recovery for the

496
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,709
heavier boilers if you add a little DNA

497
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:35,919
in there it suddenly jumps to eighty and

498
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,230
ninety percent so I don't think it's an

499
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,940
instrumentation issue I think it has to

500
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,430
do with sample prep and I tell people

501
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,640
this a lot 95 plus percent of your

502
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:50,500
problems happen before you put that file

503
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:52,210
into your auto sampler hi you did forty

504
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,920
two terpenes how many do you think is

505
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:59,049
possible that you could do so I've seen

506
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:02,890
one hundred and forty that have been run

507
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:06,789
so the problem comes from a finding

508
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,220
commercial standards and be making a

509
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:13,359
calibration curve with two hundred or a

510
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:18,430
hundred and forty calibrations right so

511
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:20,229
really as many as as you want to run you

512
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,880
don't for a lot of the commercial guys

513
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,309
they don't really care about most of

514
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,770
them they're not interesting right they

515
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,819
care about the 17 big terpenes those are

516
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,950
the ones that people want on their

517
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:32,339
labels so they answer your question is

518
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:36,190
as many as you want

519
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:37,990
thank you so my question is twofold one

520
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,299
what percentage of the products you're

521
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:43,240
testing are actually requesting the

522
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:46,389
terpene test and because the BCC back

523
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,150
down on the industry's pushback from

524
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,860
cost perspective what's being done to

525
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,019
bring the cost down so that terpene

526
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:56,409
profiling can be affordable and we can

527
00:24:53,019 --> 00:25:00,129
see that in the dispensaries so

528
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:02,890
interestingly enough I feel like the the

529
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,000
terpene requests for you know have

530
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,130
dropped down significantly

531
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,410
so a lot of the feedback right because

532
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,060
it's not a required test so you're

533
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,560
paying to put something on your label

534
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:12,779
which can potentially put you in

535
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:16,029
jeopardy

536
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,589
some people don't you know and to your

537
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:22,029
point I think that it's very valuable

538
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:24,609
information one of our focuses is a very

539
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:26,559
quick runtime another alternative is

540
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:28,990
combining the two methods right so

541
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:34,409
you're always testing for terpenes and

542
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:38,650
residual solvents so I think that really

543
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:40,390
it easier regulation and and faster

544
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,060
runtimes can help drive that cost down

545
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:49,420
and promote promote people want you to

546
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:51,819
do it and just to ask about another

547
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,940
added level of complexity in the terpene

548
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:57,099
world is the isomer differences that I'm

549
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,230
not sure the field is really embraced

550
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:01,929
yet yet we know in certain cases

551
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,849
lanaaaa all I think has different bio

552
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,340
activities depending upon what the

553
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:08,319
isomer is beta carry awfully we were

554
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:10,629
just talking and brake has different bio

555
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:14,139
activities depending upon what the

556
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:17,110
isomer is so what do you think the field

557
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,750
should do to embrace inserting isomers

558
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:22,449
standards into this technology that's a

559
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:26,019
very great question so we do see

560
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:29,250
separation of isomers I think education

561
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:31,539
is the key there right so if people

562
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,869
don't know what they want they're not

563
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:36,099
going to ask for it and laboratories are

564
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:40,119
not going to give people information

565
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:43,179
they don't want so I think that that

566
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:46,029
education really is the key there you

567
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:49,600
know we do see like system transnih

568
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:51,730
relied on people they're educated about

569
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,609
those and they they request those tests

570
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,769
but they could care less about beta

571
00:26:54,609 --> 00:27:01,299
carry awfully right but I think that

572
00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:03,460
further education helps to bring those

573
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:05,649
issues to light and I think that the

574
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,250
bioactivity of that is it's super

575
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,250
fascinating

576
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:16,359
I have my questions about pyrolysis

577
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:20,020
studies uh-huh so do you have any

578
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:23,969
recommendations if a lab was to be

579
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:27,220
interested for example in studying

580
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:31,298
different degradation and combustion

581
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:33,910
compounds in a smoke medium compared to

582
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:38,710
a vapor medium and and what's your take

583
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:42,029
on GC as an instrument for parsing out

584
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:45,789
some of the let's say the degradation

585
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:47,589
products and the product cascades that

586
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:50,740
might come from combustion yeah I think

587
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:52,298
that's totally a great idea right I've

588
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,298
had a lot of conversations recently

589
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:57,308
especially with sort of the Bates cares

590
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,720
you know they have devices hooked up to

591
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,308
a GC I think it's the appropriate

592
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,440
instrument I think a GC triple quad

593
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:05,710
would really be ideal for this so they

594
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,690
have devices that simulate smoking right

595
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,789
so they use these per cigarette analysis

596
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,779
what what's showing up in cigarette

597
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:17,109
smoke and I would I would love to create

598
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:19,298
a hyphenated system with this technology

599
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:21,909
right so you basically can measure what

600
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:24,759
a single lung full of smoke from a joint

601
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:27,759
or smoke from or vapor from a vape pen

602
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:29,289
contains and so you know you would be

603
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,419
able to see the degradation products

604
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,609
right you measure the raw product and

605
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:35,919
then the vape from it and you could

606
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:38,369
compare the two and see how much of it

607
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,620
is sort of retaining its integrity and

608
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:46,329
is PerkinElmer looking for any DEA

609
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:47,969
license labs to do these studies okay

610
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:54,129
maybe you don't know you're looking

611
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:55,269
right exactly right okay all right thank

612
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:58,680
you guys so much

613
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:58,680
[Applause]
