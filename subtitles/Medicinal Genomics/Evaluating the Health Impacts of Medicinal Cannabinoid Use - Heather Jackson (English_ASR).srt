1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:17,230
hello can you hear me okay excellent so

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,269
I will be discussing health outcome

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,789
comparisons between epilepsy patients

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:25,570
who use versus do not use cannabinoid

5
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:30,909
therapy I have a disclosure I'm recently

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:33,280
a shareholder of C W health the reason

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,009
why I stand before you is this little

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,739
bundle of joy right here the little

9
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,929
inset picture is acai and my son on

10
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,608
steroids one of the reasons I was

11
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:44,649
attracted to cannabis his therapy is

12
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,629
because he did fairly well using

13
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,460
high-dose steroids but he was a little

14
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:50,768
60 year old man at the end of that he

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,259
had cataracts and bone loss and the

16
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:55,058
seizures returned anyway he has a rare

17
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:57,789
catastrophic form of early childhood

18
00:00:55,058 --> 00:01:01,030
epilepsy called doza syndrome he

19
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:02,620
suffered seizures every single day most

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,650
of his life with the exception of about

21
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:07,170
eight months 500000 seizures by the time

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,790
he was 5 years old if you could imagine

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,680
by the time he was nine we had recycled

24
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:15,880
through 17 pharmaceuticals he was

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,740
transitioned to receiving hospice

26
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:19,719
palliative services and we wanted to

27
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:22,000
consider using cannabis as a quality of

28
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:25,659
life measure for Zakai that's him

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,489
getting an EEG in December of 2011 with

30
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:29,530
a service dog when the EEG showed

31
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:31,539
seizure activity every 10 seconds while

32
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,150
he was awake even seizures that we

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,160
weren't seeing and two to three times

34
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,350
that frequency while he slept so his

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,299
brain was on fire that's him an entire

36
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:44,799
swing recently he has used cannabidiol a

37
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:47,049
preparation that the whole plant

38
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,079
botanical extract for over six years

39
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:52,750
he's pharmaceutical free four of those

40
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,819
six years he was seizure free and then

41
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,219
puberty hit so we're kind of hanging on

42
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,139
white-knuckled through puberty and I

43
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:01,299
want to thank all of the researchers and

44
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,890
the scientists that are in the room and

45
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,679
is a complete honor to stand on this

46
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,480
stage and doctors like Bonnie Goldstein

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,340
and Dustin Sulak who have taken the

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,810
charge to help patients when their

49
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,209
doctors don't have this tool in their

50
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,360
toolkit my hat is off to you the

51
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:18,759
research I found on yes

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,800
the research I found on PubMed was the

53
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:24,099
light at an end of a very very dark

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,290
tunnel in my family's life so we created

55
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,799
the realm of caring foundation I want to

56
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:31,539
be extremely clear we are an independent

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,060
501c3 organization an independent

58
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:36,280
nonprofit we focus on research we're

59
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,710
currently enrolling in five different

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,900
studies so if you're a doctor and you're

61
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,629
trying to track patients hit our booth

62
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,610
please and if you are in the industry

63
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:47,560
and creating fabulous products you need

64
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,390
to stop by - because everyone needs to

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,150
be putting their data in this registry

66
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:54,429
so we do research so that we can educate

67
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,710
we operate a call center we field about

68
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,620
8,000 inquiries every single month we've

69
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,599
been on the phone over a million minutes

70
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,430
counseling families who are you trying

71
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,919
to use cannabis as therapy as well as

72
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,360
doctors and doctors are a third highest

73
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,419
referral source so they figured out

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,930
we're not a fringe group to get folks to

75
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:15,429
and we're building community so we

76
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,069
created an observational research

77
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,849
registry because the Kies story is just

78
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:23,769
a good story it's just an anecdotal

79
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:26,650
story what I call the amazingly amazing

80
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,540
anecdotal story but if we're not doing a

81
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,270
good job of collecting this data in a

82
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:33,310
scientific way I'm tracking what people

83
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,439
are actually using that they are

84
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,920
actually able to get out in a dispensary

85
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:41,500
or order through the mail then you know

86
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,569
I think we're doing a disservice so I'm

87
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,050
going to go over some data and our

88
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:49,180
general registry some epilepsy data from

89
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,219
our general registry we have an epilepsy

90
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,040
specific survey and then we have a

91
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,590
prospective cohort I we do have these

92
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,139
available at our booth we have a poster

93
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,719
boast that we can email you both on

94
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:04,209
epilepsy and autism so you can receive

95
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,639
this data dr. Bret did a pretty great

96
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,560
job of discussing what epilepsy is so

97
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,449
I'm going to save ourself a little bit

98
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,740
of time here it's important to realize

99
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:17,199
though that 30 percent sometimes up to

100
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,000
40% are they do have intractable

101
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,789
conditions on the other thing I'll

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,269
mention is that I believe statistically

103
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,650
this this still exists dr. Russo or

104
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:28,699
someone else can help us who's a

105
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:30,079
neurologist

106
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,029
that after the third failed

107
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,729
pharmaceutical you have less than a 1%

108
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:37,009
chance of finding one that's gonna work

109
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:39,140
so when I think about our fourteenth and

110
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,480
our 15th and our 16th and our 17th drug

111
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:43,310
that really makes me tear up we do have

112
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,710
quite a history of cannabis use in

113
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,300
epilepsy for thousands of years all the

114
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:50,329
way to of course you guys are aware of

115
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,730
an fda-approved drug for epilepsy

116
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:53,899
that's cannabis based so we do this in

117
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,400
collaboration with Johns Hopkins

118
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,919
University and the University of

119
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:59,899
Pennsylvania I'm biased I get it plants

120
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,699
saved my kid kind of loved the plant so

121
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:04,250
I looked for researchers who are very

122
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:06,409
very well published who had published on

123
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,019
the harms of cannabis as well as the

124
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,600
benefits of cannabis and so between my

125
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:14,620
two principal investigators there very

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,360
well published close to 500 articles

127
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,459
this we had a Natural History experiment

128
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,470
underway and an opportunity for phase

129
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:23,299
four data collection and so we're

130
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,430
comparing health-related outcomes of

131
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,379
cannabis users versus non users which is

132
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,280
unique about our registry we do have non

133
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:33,230
users or a control group most of the

134
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,969
prospective or observational studies

135
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,009
that are happening in this space don't

136
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,310
have that control group so we're looking

137
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:41,899
for trends and product views and dose

138
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,420
outcomes by health condition we're

139
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:46,399
evaluating those changes over time and

140
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,980
then we're evaluating the changes in

141
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,870
those who did a baseline survey who

142
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,970
we're not using cannabis as therapy and

143
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,560
then began using cannabis as therapy and

144
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:58,990
I think that's the richest dataset so

145
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,209
I'm going to orientate you to these

146
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,519
graphs real quickly so on your left hand

147
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:06,859
side is always going to be cannabis

148
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,469
users on the right hand side is non

149
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,939
users and then our p-value and/or our

150
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,880
statistical significance I've

151
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:16,310
highlighted there embolden there and

152
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,829
dark so this is all patient demographics

153
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,930
this dataset was locked at about two

154
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,550
years so we've been collecting the state

155
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:27,259
over two years this was locked at about

156
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:29,090
two years and there's 1,400 people in

157
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:32,060
this they are statistically

158
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:34,159
significantly older no real statistical

159
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,370
significance and race and they're and

160
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,230
they're more educated and that great I

161
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,050
did I didn't expect to see that so

162
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,300
that's pretty cool all patient outcome

163
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,569
comparisons again this is the the larger

164
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,740
registry we're seeing quality of life

165
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:51,500
statistically significantly improved

166
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,478
along with health satisfaction children

167
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,629
are sleeping better adults are sleeping

168
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:58,219
better anxieties anxiety is reduced and

169
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:00,259
depression is reduced so we hear these

170
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,449
anecdotal stories in the call center all

171
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,419
of the time but to be able to gather the

172
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,759
data use validated measures go through

173
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:08,870
the IRB process and have Johns Hopkins

174
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,169
statists

175
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,810
spit out this is wonderful for us we

176
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:17,870
don't see the medications show up yet

177
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,639
but we'll see that in a later slide this

178
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,598
is the primary medical conditions that

179
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,668
are in the overall registry so we're

180
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,189
serving mostly folks with neurological

181
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:29,959
disorder and that's due to a lot of the

182
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:32,990
national media we've been able to garner

183
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,750
over the last several years so you know

184
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,269
the first CNN special in 2013 and the

185
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:41,149
national story has been told in regards

186
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:43,158
to epilepsy quite a bit we have seen our

187
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:46,758
demographics change quite significantly

188
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:49,639
originally you know back in 2013 all

189
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,830
pediatric 89% and all catastrophic

190
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,098
epilepsy and we're now serving 65

191
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:58,370
percent adults and 35 percent children

192
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:59,930
chronic pain is a very large diagnosis

193
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,680
in fact in our adult population that's

194
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,348
just surpassed in our 50,000 families

195
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,819
that we serve pain is the highest that

196
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:09,560
people call in to the call center with

197
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:13,310
and then you can see some of the other

198
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,329
disorders there all where there are

199
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:20,930
strong mechanisms of action to indicate

200
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:23,899
cannabinoid use now this is the epilepsy

201
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,930
patient demographics and this is 397 so

202
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:29,598
400 participants in the study they are

203
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,189
slightly older and other than that the

204
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,908
demographics don't really show any

205
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:39,139
statistical significance so a wide

206
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:41,448
variety and many many different

207
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:44,240
diagnoses and seizure types there's 40

208
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:46,219
different seizure types and diagnoses we

209
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,680
see lennox-gastaut syndrome and dravet

210
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:53,449
syndrome doza syndrome which is what my

211
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:55,000
son has a car D epilepsy as a result of

212
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:58,209
traumatic brain injury

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,480
for example or brain malformation so we

214
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:04,960
see a lot of different diagnoses

215
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,399
represented in the registry we're

216
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,009
looking at cannabinoid therapy

217
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,240
characteristics so the vast majority of

218
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:15,220
people are using a high CBD product 38%

219
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:20,169
we do have some that are using a THC

220
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,940
product only 5% and I think that the

221
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:24,159
doctors who are taking care of patients

222
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,730
in this area you know obviously see that

223
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,549
as well

224
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,159
I was pleasantly surprised by this we

225
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:32,799
had a wonderful neurologist who did

226
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,809
everything that he could do for my son

227
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,919
in fact he made the first he was the

228
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:41,019
first neurologist to make a

229
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:43,870
recommendation back in 2012 for Zach I

230
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:47,049
for our state's cannabis license usually

231
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,330
you go to a doctor that's not practicing

232
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:52,629
who might just have a cannabis practice

233
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:57,639
so he did everything that he could in

234
00:09:52,629 --> 00:10:01,720
this registry 23% did not have doctors

235
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:04,149
recommendations and 22% did when you're

236
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,670
looking at I think doctors are concerned

237
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:10,629
about folks just starting to use weed

238
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:12,429
and not using drugs specifically in

239
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:14,470
epilepsy that actually works 70 percent

240
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:16,000
of the time but we're not finding that

241
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,220
we're finding most people are turning to

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,259
this as a last resort 34 percent and

243
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,220
using it as an adjunct therapy so

244
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:23,559
they're adding it to their

245
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,420
pharmaceutical regimen a very small

246
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:28,539
percentage only 4% are using this as

247
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:31,059
frontline medications and 12% are using

248
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:33,699
it a second-line medication we have a

249
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:35,979
little girl named melody she has a cardi

250
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,890
syndrome generally a cardi has a very

251
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,720
poor outcome and they generally don't

252
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:45,879
walk and talk often they need feeding

253
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,860
tubes I just got a video of melody who

254
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,450
has sight words who's learned her

255
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,180
alphabet she's starting kindergarten

256
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,860
she's dancing and this was their second

257
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:55,659
line therapy they tried depakote and

258
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,589
then they turned right to cannabis and

259
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:02,049
so what I'm excited about elated about

260
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:03,940
is that people are turning to this

261
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:07,079
sooner they don't have to wait a decade

262
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,680
like we did where health outcomes are

263
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,450
significantly

264
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,809
affected for the rest of their life

265
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,700
Sakai will probably be dependent on us

266
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:18,309
you know into adulthood and then we've

267
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,870
got to figure that out afterwards so I'm

268
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:22,209
actually really excited that people are

269
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,370
turning to this as medicine sooner

270
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,860
rather than later

271
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,289
the reason why I did pull out the CW

272
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,740
hemp juice was because 61% of the

273
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:35,588
epilepsy population were using some sort

274
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,810
of product from CW and because it's a

275
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:40,180
regimented product we're able to see

276
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:42,669
exactly how many milligrams that is so I

277
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:45,549
wanted to give you some variances in

278
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,899
dosing if you attended the CME course

279
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:49,599
yesterday you learned that there's this

280
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,179
really really wide range and we see that

281
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,278
here as well this is when you turn these

282
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:57,729
into milligrams this is seven milligrams

283
00:11:54,278 --> 00:12:00,519
a day up to 600 milligrams a day of CBD

284
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,680
the average is 2 milligrams per kilogram

285
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,179
and I think this is really important for

286
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,109
doctors to recognize because if you're

287
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:08,049
looking at double-blind

288
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,209
placebo-controlled trials to give dosing

289
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:12,549
for a whole plant botanical extract

290
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:15,039
where those don't met those don't match

291
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:16,990
up and so I think they start up a

292
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,208
dialect at 5 milligrams per kilogram and

293
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,769
we're seeing 20 or 25 milligrams per

294
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:24,129
kilogram so it's really important to

295
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:27,970
recognize there's quite a dosing

296
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:30,278
disparagement there people are of course

297
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,930
are using many different products some

298
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,929
are very difficult to figure out how

299
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:38,528
many milligrams they're using so a high

300
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:40,269
THC cannabis flowers the top 114 users

301
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:42,070
and so they would they would use 14

302
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:43,720
joints per day so of course that's

303
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,020
really difficult to figure out how many

304
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,680
milligrams they're using but people are

305
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:52,659
accessing what works for them which is I

306
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:55,208
think frustrating for people but

307
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:58,659
incredibly empowering to people like me

308
00:12:55,208 --> 00:13:02,049
who I appreciate pharmaceutical I'm very

309
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:04,569
thankful for its role but it was a big

310
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:06,309
ball and chain for my family and I with

311
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,350
very severe side effects for a very long

312
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:10,179
time so the individualized medicine

313
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,009
piece kind of scares people the nice

314
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:14,109
part is this is individualized medicine

315
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:17,970
and you can figure out what's going to

316
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:21,278
work for you so health characteristics

317
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,360
we see health satisfaction statistically

318
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,639
significantly in

319
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,039
as well as children sleeping better and

320
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,679
adults sleeping better anxiety is

321
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,870
clinically improved but not

322
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,569
statistically significantly improved in

323
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,250
this population and then depression is

324
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,329
also statistically significantly

325
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,100
improved and then we don't see

326
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:43,359
prescriptions show up quite yet but we

327
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,639
do in a future slide healthcare service

328
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,889
utilization so this is economic data to

329
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,629
me so if they're on less pharmaceuticals

330
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:50,889
if they're going to the doctor less

331
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,659
emergency room visits and

332
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:55,208
hospitalizations that's a financial

333
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:56,740
burden often to Medicaid because a lot

334
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:59,049
of the families we serve have

335
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,240
disabilities and so we're seeing less

336
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:03,458
outpatient visits we're seeing less

337
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,589
emergency room visits and less hospital

338
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:07,359
admissions we're seeing a few less sick

339
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:10,300
days too although not statistically

340
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,690
significant now this is a relatively

341
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:16,059
small and it's 24 and in that large

342
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,649
registry we have an epilepsy specific

343
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:20,588
survey so we need to get more people

344
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:23,259
completing this additional survey but

345
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:26,350
hospital visits are down both

346
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:29,708
seizure-related outpatient visits ER

347
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:33,879
visits and hospital admissions we've got

348
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:36,069
the seizure activity is down so 42

349
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,350
seizures about 216 seizures so that's

350
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,240
statistically significant and then the

351
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,519
length of the seizure is decreased

352
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,350
that's about three minutes and 40

353
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:47,169
seconds to about less than two and a

354
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,089
half minutes so clinically significant

355
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:52,269
certainly if you've ever held a loved

356
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:54,459
one who's having a seizure and five of

357
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:57,028
these 24 reported no seizure activity in

358
00:14:54,458 --> 00:15:00,039
the past month of the twenty-nine nine

359
00:14:57,028 --> 00:15:02,198
users who initiated use quality of life

360
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,299
shows up here health satisfaction

361
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:06,958
statistically significantly improved as

362
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:09,419
well as children's sleep anxiety

363
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:13,509
statistically significantly improved

364
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:15,519
depression is off the charts there you

365
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:17,500
see prescription medications about 25

366
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,060
percent reduced over-the-counter

367
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,860
medications are statistically

368
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:25,659
significantly reduced and when asked 275

369
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,399
respondents this is free text so they

370
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:30,219
can just it's quantitative data they

371
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,929
could just type it in 50 they were asked

372
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,860
how has therapeutic use of cannabinoids

373
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:37,259
helped two hundred and

374
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,080
seventy-five respondents just typed

375
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:42,149
things in 52 percent reported reduction

376
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,950
in seizure activity 18 percent reported

377
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,949
an improvement in cognition which we've

378
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:49,200
heard from earlier speakers 13 percent

379
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:53,700
reported improved mood and 12 percent

380
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:56,610
reported a reduction in their seizure

381
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,830
duration when asked about harms caused

382
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,889
or problems associated with cannabinoid

383
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,139
use 64 percent typed in hey we don't

384
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,669
we're not having any issues but there is

385
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,590
a small percentage of folks that are

386
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:10,139
having issues four percent reported

387
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,060
increased seizure frequency usually at

388
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,970
initiation or at the time of a dose

389
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,619
increase which can level out four

390
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,009
percent reported a problem with cost

391
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:23,490
three percent reported consequences with

392
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:26,789
legality or concerns with legality and

393
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:29,220
then 2 percent so a very small side

394
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:31,679
effect profile GI related issues feeling

395
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,680
foggy or tired interactions with their

396
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,569
antiepileptic drugs or the stigma

397
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,819
associated with cannabis which

398
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:42,090
unfortunately still exists so in

399
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,620
conclusion this observational study was

400
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,110
conducted with a diverse group of

401
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,519
epilepsy patients cannabis therapy users

402
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,950
scored better on most health-related

403
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,889
outcomes measured compared with a

404
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,090
demographically similar control group

405
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:56,069
outcomes replicated and were

406
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,320
corroborated by the prospective study of

407
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,090
a sub group who were controls at

408
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,980
baseline and then initiated use so

409
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,799
that's always a little checkbox for us

410
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,559
to take a look at CBD products were used

411
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:12,119
by the majority of these folks often as

412
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:14,220
a last treatment choice and many cases

413
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,229
of substantial positive clinical and

414
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,699
quality of life impact for individuals

415
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,190
which is what our world revolves around

416
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,050
at realm of caring adverse consequences

417
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,970
are rare but they do certainly present

418
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:25,740
in a subset of participants so I think

419
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,240
it's important to look at that and we

420
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,309
definitely need a larger sample group

421
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,140
for more subgroup analysis so to just

422
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:33,450
pull out your one minute to just pull

423
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,220
out doza syndrome for example so some

424
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,930
limitations I definitely want to discuss

425
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,279
is that there are a variety of cannabis

426
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,920
products available and so dose

427
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,200
calculations fairly difficult it is a

428
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,150
convenient sample there certainly could

429
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,700
be some bias in reporting that should be

430
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,190
considered the data is limited

431
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,200
to self-reports either of themselves or

432
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,090
of a caregiver so there could be a lack

433
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,740
of objective assessment I think that's a

434
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,750
limitation but I think a true strength

435
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,579
of the study is that we're asking for a

436
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,909
report of current status and that's

437
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:04,379
going to minimize recall about bias and

438
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:07,409
there's really no incentive for them to

439
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,230
lie on the survey and certainly label

440
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:12,570
accuracy is also an issue so a special

441
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,929
thanks to my principal investigator ryan

442
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:19,648
van dree marcel von miller aaron and

443
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:21,419
nick joel from my team my entire team at

444
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:23,129
realm of caring we do have a booth so

445
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,380
please come check us out all the

446
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,210
participants who supported this body of

447
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,429
evidence and lest we forget

448
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:33,380
this isn't about cannabis it's about

449
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:33,380
community so thank you very much
