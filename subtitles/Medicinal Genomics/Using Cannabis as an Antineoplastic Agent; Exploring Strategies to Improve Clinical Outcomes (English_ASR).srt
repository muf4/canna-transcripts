1
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:13,599
good afternoon or I might even say good

2
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:16,750
evening I'd like to thank Doug and and

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,969
Bonnie goldstein and the organizers of

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:24,698
the conference for inviting me to

5
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:28,059
moderate I'd also like to thank the

6
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:37,929
remarkable panel that has agreed to

7
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:40,450
share their knowledge with us today I'd

8
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:43,600
only tired cardiologist who first became

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:46,750
interested in cannabinoid oncology

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,480
when I saw Mara Gordon show brain scans

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,399
from patients with brain tumors who were

12
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:54,819
treated with cannabis and had

13
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:58,120
well-documented shrinkage of the tumors

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,750
when I saw those images I knew that's

15
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:04,539
what I wanted to do Mar was kind enough

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,069
to teach me her method for approaching

17
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:09,939
patients with tumors

18
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:12,818
I saw many patients many patients were

19
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:14,950
able to shrink their tumors and many

20
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:18,849
were able to achieve no evidence of

21
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:21,909
disease however I saw far too many

22
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:25,899
patients who failed to respond to

23
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:30,310
cannabinoid antineoplastic therapy about

24
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:32,799
a year ago dr. Betty Mary gave a talk to

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,799
the Society of cannabis clinicians and

26
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,079
this presentation stimulated me to

27
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,368
reassess the therapeutic cannabinoid

28
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,129
protocols that I had been using I'm

29
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:48,819
gonna can I mention your names down and

30
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:50,708
just sort of wave your hand to introduce

31
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:57,159
yourself when I say your name I thought

32
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:59,349
what you correct so I'm afraid when I

33
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,959
was asked to moderate this panel and

34
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:04,179
select the panelists I thought that we

35
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,819
would learn the most by merging the

36
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:13,750
intellectual capital of the best

37
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:16,599
researchers dr. Mary dr. Sanchez dr.

38
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:20,099
Russo and

39
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:25,150
nation's doctors herdin rather &amp;

40
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:27,129
Goldstein an aspect of dr. Murray's work

41
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,129
also dealt with the use of various

42
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:33,819
solvents and so I wanted Dustin Mahon

43
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:36,310
the CEO and chief executive chief

44
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:39,579
science officer of Indo can alabs in

45
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,129
Colorado to show us extraction results

46
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:45,310
of several chemo VARs with multiple

47
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:47,259
solvents laboratory work that we have

48
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,439
available in this country we don't have

49
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:54,519
mass spectrograph since dr. mary has as

50
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:56,650
at his disposal dr. Goldstein and dr.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,340
Hagen rather will share their experience

52
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,980
first hopefully speak to their failures

53
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,310
as well as their successes in using

54
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:08,979
cannabinoids in the treatment of cancer

55
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,259
then and then mr. Mahan will show us

56
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:13,659
some comparisons of various cultivars

57
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:16,870
and multiple solvents with that

58
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:20,020
background we will then begin asking the

59
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,330
full panel the questions detailed in the

60
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,510
panel description I hope you have all

61
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:29,050
those you have those at your disposal

62
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:33,120
now otherwise I'll be reading them as we

63
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:38,130
go and and the objective of the panel is

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:42,009
to learn how we can better apply

65
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:46,780
preclinical research to improve patient

66
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:50,429
outcomes so with that if if you would

67
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,430
start please dr. goldstein

68
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,379
good evening everybody

69
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:58,869
so I'm gonna talk about my experience

70
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:03,969
with mostly pediatric patients that I

71
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:05,400
treat with cannabinoid cannabinoids for

72
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:09,819
cancer

73
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,400
remember cancer is a term that we use

74
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:15,419
that encompasses a whole bunch of

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,120
different diseases and as dr. Sanchez

76
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:21,488
and dr. Murray's research shows that we

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,259
can have breast cancer we can have colon

78
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,609
cancer but there's still subtypes and

79
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,909
they may not respond the same way so

80
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,139
it's a it's a very difficult complex

81
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,300
question when you're approaching

82
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,759
patients that come into your office and

83
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,300
are asking for help a few of the

84
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,550
concerns with Pediatrics is that they

85
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,030
are same chemotherapies are being

86
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:46,470
recycled over the years of very few new

87
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:49,419
treatments for these kids also

88
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:52,000
unfortunately pediatric cancer only

89
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:56,110
receives about four percent of all

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,660
cancer research money so there is 96

91
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,600
percent of the cancer research money

92
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,810
goes to adult cancers and so that's also

93
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,390
kind of hindering research I will tell

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,730
you that also what I'm finding is that

95
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,099
when parents come in with their children

96
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,140
one of the biggest concerns is my child

97
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,510
may survive but what is the quality of

98
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,639
my child's life going to be down the

99
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:21,250
future is my child going to get a

100
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,779
secondary malignancy from radiation is

101
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,790
my child going to have cognitive

102
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,289
impairment from chemotherapy and

103
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,020
radiation is my child going to have

104
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,460
cardiac disease and I was preparing for

105
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,259
this panel I actually read about a

106
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:34,539
gentleman who's doing research at

107
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,909
University Hospital in San Antonio who

108
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:41,290
he himself is in his forties and he is a

109
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:46,660
cancer survivor and he is in his 40s had

110
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:48,669
has had severe repercussions from the

111
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52,330
chemotherapy he's had a cardiac arrest

112
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:56,019
he's had strokes and so he is actually

113
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:58,418
studying what chemo does to those who

114
00:05:56,019 --> 00:06:00,339
survive from childhood cancers and he

115
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:03,009
says it accelerates the aging process

116
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:04,810
and if you've seen some research in the

117
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,209
last couple years about cannabis we know

118
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,089
that it can help actually kind of

119
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:11,829
reverse aging as well so when I have a

120
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:13,359
patient that comes in with cancer of

121
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,779
course I go through a history physical

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,669
exam I talk about with the family what

123
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,319
their goals are with cannabis therapy

124
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:24,009
for some of them it is just symptomatic

125
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,810
treatment because they're on a protocol

126
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:31,589
that may give them very good survival

127
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:36,600
some of them want to add cannabis as a

128
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:39,250
adjunct antineoplastic agent and so I

129
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,569
often discuss both treatments with the

130
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,249
families many of them do opt even

131
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,658
they start with symptomatic treatment

132
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:46,610
many of them as they see that their

133
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:47,899
child's responding really well then they

134
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,550
come back and say you know what we want

135
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:52,908
to up the dose we want to start giving

136
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,520
our child more cannabis to see if we can

137
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:58,728
try to kill it increase the chances that

138
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,938
our child's going to survive this with

139
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:04,128
children I use all the cannabinoids we

140
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:06,349
were there obviously the research that

141
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:08,149
dr. Mary and dr. Sanchez are doing is

142
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:10,278
very helpful but still to this day we

143
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:13,579
don't know what combinations are going

144
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:15,588
to kill which cancers so as we're going

145
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:18,079
to discuss I think other panelists are

146
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:20,300
gonna probably say the same thing I have

147
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,118
found that combination treatment is

148
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,848
clearly the way to go I usually use five

149
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:30,529
different cannabinoids and once I heard

150
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:33,498
me speak yesterday so CBD THC THC a CBD

151
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:37,399
a and C B G I try to use as many

152
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:39,289
different preparations and also from

153
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,759
different companies because then I can

154
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:42,139
be sure that they're probably going to

155
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,389
be grown a little bit differently

156
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:47,329
they're going to hopefully cover a lot

157
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,860
of the different compounds right now I

158
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:50,449
kind of look at this as you know

159
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,800
somebody comes into a hospital who's

160
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:56,269
really sick and you do not know what

161
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,619
let's say they know they have an

162
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,418
infection but you don't know what they

163
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:00,669
have he may send a culture and you cover

164
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:02,748
them with what we call broad-spectrum

165
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:04,908
antibiotics till you can narrow down

166
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:07,009
what's going to work and that's kind of

167
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:08,718
how I approach this broad spectrum using

168
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:12,379
multiple different compounds to try to

169
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:14,509
see what will work and I start low dose

170
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,879
and we titrate up of course always

171
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:18,408
concerned about side effects if there's

172
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,329
going to be any I will tell you children

173
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:22,338
because I have taken care of adults with

174
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:24,769
cancer too children tolerate

175
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:27,079
cannabinoids way better than adults they

176
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:28,879
have they don't drive a car they don't

177
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,778
go to work they don't have to make

178
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,918
dinner so they kind of go with the flow

179
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:36,049
many of them

180
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,448
I will tell you the parents will tell me

181
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,948
there is absolutely no side effect and

182
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:42,708
their child goes from being sick on

183
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:44,179
chemo or side effects of radiation I

184
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,549
have one patient it went down from about

185
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,500
90 pounds down to 57 pounds post

186
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:52,729
radiation and she's gained it all back

187
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,278
just from adding cannabis in so children

188
00:08:52,730 --> 00:09:00,619
really tolerate cannabis well and

189
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:02,989
in my experience I am seeing just over

190
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:05,028
the last few years that more and more

191
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:07,699
patients or parents are bringing their

192
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:10,159
children to me earlier in treatment

193
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:11,568
rather than waiting until they've been

194
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,238
told that there's no other treatment

195
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:18,139
many of them want to help their child

196
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:21,139
get the but of course the best results

197
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:23,178
so that's all I have to say I don't know

198
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:26,480
if there's anything that you want to add

199
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:29,269
Joe you'll have a chance to oh to weigh

200
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,339
in later okay just one other thing Joe

201
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:35,989
did ask me to talk about like possibly

202
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,059
the patients that don't respond so

203
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:39,709
sometimes people get to my office so

204
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:41,389
late like unfortunately had a child show

205
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:43,808
up on a Wednesday and the child died

206
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:48,350
Friday that's obviously not enough time

207
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:49,969
to be able to intervene although the

208
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,298
family didn't even have time to get oil

209
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,678
I've had other patients come in who

210
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:56,119
clearly it's towards the end and I don't

211
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,519
think that it's going to reverse

212
00:09:56,119 --> 00:10:00,259
anything but certainly quality of life

213
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,119
at the end of life so that the child's

214
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:05,778
out of pain may be eating a little bit

215
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:08,269
baby boy playful certainly makes a

216
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:10,308
difference for these families there are

217
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:12,889
a few cancers that have I've not got

218
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:15,399
good results with DIPG if you've heard

219
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:17,418
of that it's a very rare brain tumor

220
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,328
unfortunately we have not gotten very

221
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:22,578
good success one of patients who have

222
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:24,318
leukemia seem to respond really well so

223
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:26,178
of course it also depends on the kind of

224
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:28,009
cancer in terms of response and also

225
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:31,808
what at what stage they are when they

226
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,808
get to me thank you

227
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:40,129
well I wanted to first thank the or the

228
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,720
organization for the opportunity to

229
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:43,759
participate it's wonderful to get

230
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,860
together with our colleagues from around

231
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:49,458
the world and meet new folks in the

232
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,680
field I've been a cannabis doc for a

233
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,539
long time I started my career about 40

234
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,969
years ago on a commune in Tennessee

235
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:57,649
learning about cannabis as medicine but

236
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,470
cancer wasn't part of that at that time

237
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,940
wasn't until I opened my office about 20

238
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,120
years ago up in Sebastopol California

239
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,279
that I began to see cannabis cancer

240
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,139
patients on a regular basis at that

241
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,149
point there are somewhere in the range

242
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,180
of 8 to 10 percent of my patient

243
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,919
population came with cancer and since

244
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:18,259
that time really in the last three years

245
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,509
this demographic has changed drastically

246
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:22,789
to where now they're about 30 to 40

247
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:25,129
percent of the patients that come in to

248
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:28,250
see me are coming because of cancer and

249
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:31,250
mostly asking for treatment that may

250
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:34,309
mitigate may help in the in slowing the

251
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:36,320
progression of these tumors that's a

252
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:38,539
huge difference and I think those of you

253
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,390
are are going to see the same kind of

254
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:43,939
demographic in your practices I have

255
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:46,939
seen some amazing things over the years

256
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,860
and some of the first ones were smoking

257
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,410
a small amount of cannabis on a daily

258
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,079
basis to see a Glee a glioblastoma never

259
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:55,850
recur for eight years for nine years I

260
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,189
might add before that point that the

261
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,509
patient stopped smoking cannabis and he

262
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,209
had a full recurrence of the tumor

263
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:05,088
within a year I've also seen a

264
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:07,278
neuroblastoma disappear after UCSF had

265
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:09,380
given up on him and they sent him home

266
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,689
and said comfort care we don't have

267
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:13,490
anything more to offer and then he too

268
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,810
as a nine-year-old began to smoke a

269
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,389
little bit of cannabis for pain relief

270
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,849
and within a couple years the tumor had

271
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:21,409
disappeared malignant melanoma is

272
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,190
another case where I've seen them

273
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:24,889
disappear

274
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,230
these tumors disappear in multiple

275
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:30,350
patients over a period of time and since

276
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,690
these other tumors had a carcinoma other

277
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,810
people with glioblastoma and really

278
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,699
multiple tumors have done well but

279
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:39,708
saying that I also have to say the

280
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:42,198
majority of patients with cancer don't

281
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:44,028
see this kind of response of course I'm

282
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:45,859
not controlling for either the cannabis

283
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:47,689
or for the

284
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,430
treatment protocol I might advise a

285
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,920
treatment protocol but I have no idea

286
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:54,588
what they're gonna do once they go out

287
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:58,009
into the back to home and try to find

288
00:12:54,589 --> 00:13:00,110
these products so approaching a patient

289
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:03,528
with cancer I think is very important to

290
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,528
just be and as you know the ethical

291
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:09,200
approach is to say look I expect that

292
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:11,838
we're going to get treatment benefits in

293
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,519
terms of symptomatic cures or

294
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,200
symptomatic relief you're going to have

295
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,060
a better appetite you're gonna have some

296
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,769
pain control you're gonna sleep better

297
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,689
your mood is going to be better the

298
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,519
anxiety is going to go down nausea and

299
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,980
vomiting are going to be controlled we

300
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,019
can expect that in most all patients who

301
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,209
use cannabis at all but whether or not a

302
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:31,578
tumor is going to regress that's a whole

303
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:34,039
other thing and you know it's looking at

304
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:36,828
the work of dr. Sanchez and dr. Mary and

305
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:39,110
others before who have really led us to

306
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:41,629
say well you know it was McCallister's

307
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:45,320
work of seven years ago eight years ago

308
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:47,899
who said hey THC and CBD work together

309
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,629
better there's a synergy of these

310
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:52,970
molecules so this has led us along the

311
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:55,309
way to being directing patients to some

312
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,560
at least hope that we're gonna find a

313
00:13:55,309 --> 00:14:01,819
combination of cannabis cannabinoids

314
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:05,629
that that may work best so at the least

315
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,699
I want symptomatic relief at the most we

316
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:10,338
may get lucky and be able to treat a

317
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:12,708
cancer really effectively and slow the

318
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:15,529
progression or in a rare case see a

319
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,909
tumor disappear but for those patients

320
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:20,480
that come to me and they're already

321
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:22,370
chronic cannabis smokers I say look you

322
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,528
know it doesn't really look good because

323
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,289
this tumor has developed in in the face

324
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:29,600
of a regular use of cannabis and we can

325
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:32,088
certainly try high-dose therapy and we

326
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,829
often do that so that's getting up into

327
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,500
these gram quantities that have kind of

328
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:39,078
gotten known as the Simpson Simpson oil

329
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,519
and that protocol of taking a large

330
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,039
amount of cannabinoids

331
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,009
I can't attest to any results for that

332
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:49,189
but people are at least trying it

333
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:51,740
we also are still faced with the issue

334
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,690
of people come in and say what is the

335
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,789
best strain for me to treat this cancer

336
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,030
and we simply do not have that

337
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,490
information yet

338
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,799
we're close as we can feel the research

339
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:06,120
coming I know people are gonna be

340
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:08,309
looking for THC and CBD and CBD and from

341
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,919
this point on they may also be looking

342
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:15,859
for compound 3 3 118 B you know that

343
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,079
they didn't say the right one right

344
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:22,519
[Laughter]

345
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:25,410
okay I'll scratch that out of my notes

346
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,870
so method of administration I think is

347
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:30,299
very interesting because we do know that

348
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,970
a puff on cannabis has a very high blood

349
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,979
level for a short period of time and it

350
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,960
was the great work of Donald tashkin

351
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,409
sitting in the front row who taught us

352
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,660
that yes this is in it does provide some

353
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:44,279
injuries some irritation to the lung in

354
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,409
the Airways but we're not going to be

355
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,509
causing COPD and emphysema and

356
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:51,120
significant alterations in the pulmonary

357
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:53,100
function studies so you know I don't

358
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,019
discourage people from smoked or

359
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,149
vaporized cannabis as a method of

360
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,279
administration otherwise if we're going

361
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:01,769
to be treating cannabis treating with

362
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,230
cannabis we tend to look to the to the

363
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:07,649
oral forms in order to get the big doses

364
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:10,080
that we think might be necessary again

365
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:13,019
some of these cases that did so well

366
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,240
earlier 15 years ago in my career as a

367
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:18,029
cannabis specialist were very small

368
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,680
amounts in many cases and so I don't

369
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,750
know if we're way over acting to be

370
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,088
giving graham quantities of cannabinoids

371
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,610
we may be but there seems to be

372
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:29,010
information that we don't really fully

373
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,480
understand yet and that would be markers

374
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:32,669
of the tumors that would give us some

375
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,980
clues as to what tumors are going to

376
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:38,069
respond best to what cannabinoid

377
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,889
profiles dosing in frequency this is

378
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,810
tailored to meet the patient's needs it

379
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:44,549
really has to do with what kind of tumor

380
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:46,559
we're doing dealing with if it's a

381
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:48,209
slow-growing tumor and they just want to

382
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,189
come in and have an idea as to what to

383
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,780
do it may be a small dose of

384
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,210
cannabinoids at bedtime that's

385
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:57,000
sufficient if we want to ramp it up we

386
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,280
might give a big dose of of CBD in the

387
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,990
daytime even twice in the day the

388
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,360
morning in the afternoon and have a more

389
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,949
sustained blood level so now you can get

390
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,088
up into hundreds of milligram quantities

391
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:10,318
of CBD rich full plant extract cannabis

392
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:13,619
oils if they

393
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,778
tolerated the THC in their product then

394
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,969
fine I think it's probably a good idea

395
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:20,009
until we learn better but for a bedtime

396
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,370
dose I'm really encouraging people to

397
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:26,338
use a combination of THC and the other

398
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:28,379
cannabinoids acid cannabinoids I think

399
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,629
are certainly a value too and I do talk

400
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,399
about the green green cannabis as well

401
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,919
if they have friends that are growing

402
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:37,018
put those buds in a blender and and have

403
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:41,070
them on a daily basis if they possibly

404
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:44,099
can the duration of action is different

405
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:45,720
because of these p450 cytochromes that

406
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:47,638
are a little different from patient to

407
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,490
patient some people are gonna probably

408
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:52,859
be adequate with a dose a day and others

409
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,409
may need three doses a day in order to

410
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:58,408
optimize or maximize their cannabinoid

411
00:17:55,409 --> 00:18:00,330
therapy so I'm excited to be in the

412
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:03,028
field I do the best that I can and I'm

413
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:06,178
really relying on these colleagues of

414
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:08,490
mine in this field to guide us as to

415
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,230
what might be best in the future and

416
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,628
it's one thing to grow them in a lab and

417
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,210
kill cells in a laboratory on a petri

418
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:18,000
dish and quite another to be able to do

419
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,190
it in vivo in people that are dealing

420
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,009
with these cancers so that's more or

421
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,048
less the way I'm approaching cannabis

422
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:27,089
therapy of cancers and I'll welcome the

423
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:35,190
opportunity to answer questions if they

424
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:37,470
come along thank you thank you my name

425
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,700
is Dustin Mahan I'm the president CEO

426
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:43,019
and CFO of ICI labs in Denver Colorado

427
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,750
last two years I was out in the crowd

428
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,849
with you guys watching these great minds

429
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,200
up here I mean I'm so humbled right and

430
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:53,339
how did he apply here with this panel

431
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,950
that I words can't say enough of how

432
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:58,528
thankful I am to dr. Joe and all the

433
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:01,230
people that can met here cannabis has

434
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:03,778
saved my life and it has fascinated me

435
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,278
ever since I jumped into the to

436
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:08,398
understanding it I did a quick

437
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:10,528
experiment here to try to help help the

438
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:12,589
panelists and understand a little bit

439
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,589
more

440
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:19,480
go gotta go back

441
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:38,610
which way am i okay so we are extraction

442
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,440
experts at Colorado in Colorado we use

443
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:43,740
hydrocarbon extraction as methanol

444
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,558
extraction I did use a lab white label

445
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,839
to do some co2 extractions for me here

446
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,389
so there's still much more research that

447
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,819
needs to be done from the cannabis plant

448
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,160
on what things do what here but we

449
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:59,069
wanted to focus specifically on the

450
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,600
cannabinoids and terpenoids cannabinoids

451
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:03,359
and turkeys have shown largely they have

452
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,939
a significant impact on cancer cells

453
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,769
there are far too many variables right

454
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,350
now to validate really a best

455
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:12,089
classification for solvents however this

456
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,919
experiment will provide information on

457
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:15,808
the best solvent for specific

458
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,420
applications like total cannabinoid

459
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:21,869
potencies or efficiencies right now we

460
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,330
have an inability to test all of the

461
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:26,299
great things that my friend here gets to

462
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,558
test with cannabinoids and turkeys but

463
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,509
it leaves us with probably more

464
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,639
questions and we have answers but this

465
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:36,119
is as far as we've gotten we really need

466
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,040
a lot more research so the few things

467
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,500
that we look for out of the cannabinoid

468
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,259
extraction or from extraction of

469
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,299
cannabinoid plant is going to be

470
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:46,859
efficiencies so how much of the

471
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,690
cannabinoids and the terpenes did we

472
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:50,939
pull out of the plant material as well

473
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,350
as potencies so how pure is the

474
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,700
concentrate that we get out of it

475
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:56,459
the other thing that I like to look at

476
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,640
is the decarboxylation rates you know

477
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,670
the plant grows in their raw acidic

478
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,100
cannabinoids and certain extraction

479
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:09,630
techniques actually will activate those

480
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:12,689
cannabinoids so the different variables

481
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:15,990
that I tried to accomplish here we're

482
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:19,019
gonna be using a quick wash versus a

483
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,910
soak which is going to be plant material

484
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:23,009
on a quick wash is contacted and very

485
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,140
minimal exposure time trying to increase

486
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:27,539
the period ease but you're gonna

487
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,130
sacrifice some efficiencies versus

488
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,720
soaking the plant material where you're

489
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,550
contacting with the solvent for

490
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,529
prolonged periods of time trying to pull

491
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,200
as much of the cannabinoids and

492
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:37,920
Terrapins out of the plant material but

493
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,160
understanding that you'll probably pull

494
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,940
some

495
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,910
impurities as well so we took two

496
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,710
different chemo VARs of cannabis we took

497
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,500
the high THC strain and a high CBD

498
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:52,710
strain here we ran them through several

499
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,539
different methodologies of salt of quick

500
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,750
wash and soak with five different

501
00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:02,460
solvents and we had the cannabinoids and

502
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:05,009
terpenoids tested on the starting plant

503
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,920
material the concentrate as well as the

504
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:10,740
ending plant material so we used propane

505
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,900
and butane we used ethanol and then we

506
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:17,549
did a subcritical and a supercritical

507
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:20,790
co2 extraction one of the major

508
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:23,819
questions that I get is how much solvent

509
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:25,980
is left over every state in the that's

510
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:28,049
legalized to set some sort of residual

511
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,660
solvent level even the United States

512
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:31,529
pharmacopoeia set a residual solvent

513
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,690
level that they could have in

514
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:34,980
pharmaceuticals however I'm a huge fan

515
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,809
of leaving that you should really not

516
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,289
have any residual solvents left over in

517
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:42,480
your product and I have proven and it is

518
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:43,619
possible to remove the solvents from all

519
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,500
the different methodologies that I've

520
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:49,889
shown here so it's a quick you know test

521
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,420
that we get in Colorado from rm3 a lot

522
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,610
of n B's up there I could flood your

523
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,920
inbox with n DS but I think we can all

524
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:57,149
agree that it's it's very possible to

525
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,910
get all your solvent out of there

526
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:02,220
so the different cultivars I used the

527
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,890
first one this is my THC strain this is

528
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,890
our alien rock candy somewhere in about

529
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:12,380
6% terpene content 22% cannabinoid

530
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:15,570
content to your cannabinoid test from

531
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,880
the alien rock candy and then my

532
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:21,359
spectrum strain spectrum is a very high

533
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,520
CBD strain we grow it out to a little

534
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,799
over the point 3 percent THC mark but

535
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:31,319
it's used heavily in Colorado as a hemp

536
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:32,789
strain so our M 3 distant testing for us

537
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,740
and the things that we were able to

538
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:36,509
figure out well we wanted to look at

539
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,799
what solvent extracts Tobel total

540
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:42,119
cannabinoids with the highest potency

541
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:45,629
here so on the THC heavy strain we found

542
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,009
that supercritical co2 actually tested

543
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,590
at the highest purity at eighty five

544
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,900
point three three percent propane quick

545
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:52,819
wash which is you know

546
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,800
minimal soak time which makes sense we

547
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:56,659
hit eighty three point eight one percent

548
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,930
and the butane quick wash at eighty

549
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:02,000
three point five nine percent on the CBD

550
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,430
strain your propane and your

551
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,940
supercritical flipped but they're pretty

552
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:09,259
negligible in in potencies they're at

553
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,690
eighty one point eight and eighty one

554
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:14,450
point seven six and then the propane so

555
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,630
came in eighty one point zero one so the

556
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,610
way I looked at for highest efficiency

557
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,780
isn't necessarily how many grams you

558
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:22,309
pulled out of there but how many

559
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:23,930
milligrams that you pulled out of there

560
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:26,869
so multiplying your grams by your

561
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:28,400
potencies there and on their heavy THC

562
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:30,859
stream we found that the butane quick

563
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,560
wash came in at the the highest

564
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:35,899
efficiency and ethanol soak right behind

565
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,539
that which again with in point one

566
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,009
percent so pretty negligible and the

567
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:43,519
propane quick wash came in right after

568
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:46,160
that on the CBD strain we had a really

569
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:49,009
really great extraction with the ethanol

570
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:54,019
soaked supercritical co2 came in after

571
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:57,170
that and then a butane quick wash as far

572
00:24:54,019 --> 00:25:00,200
as terpenes go propane quick wash one

573
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:02,570
out on both sides there the ethanol we

574
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,450
had a soak for THC and a quick wash for

575
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:07,730
the CBD and then the ethanol quick wash

576
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:11,029
again for THC and a butane quick wash

577
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:14,059
for the CBD and then as far as the

578
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:16,099
extraction efficiencies propane again

579
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:19,429
looking really good for your terpenes

580
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:22,369
coming in ethanol and butane right

581
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:25,549
behind that so the only thing that I

582
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:28,129
really recognize in the testing for

583
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:31,389
decarboxylation rates was that it was

584
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,620
the co2 process that tended to

585
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,630
decarboxylase the plant material now I

586
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:37,849
understand there is specific ways that

587
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,030
you can run your machines we ran these

588
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:43,039
on a very commercial very standard

589
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:45,579
supercritical subcritical and we saw

590
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,879
that supercritical across-the-board

591
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:50,960
decarboxylase both THC and CBD about 60%

592
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,140
the interesting thing though on the

593
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,650
subcritical run is that your THC in your

594
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:01,110
spectrum THC jumped about 20% and the

595
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:04,080
CBD jumped 40% however the

596
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:06,990
or the THC in the CBD strain jumped 40

597
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,808
percent but the CBD in that spectrum

598
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,669
strain only jumped 2 percent so i

599
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:13,678
theorize that it's actually the

600
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,149
different pressures that are extracting

601
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,440
in that subcritical the difference

602
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:19,079
between subcritical and supercritical

603
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,200
being the pressures that our subcritical

604
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:25,648
hit high enough just to activate the THC

605
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,019
but not enough to activate the CBD so is

606
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:29,428
there really a best solvent I think what

607
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,259
we have shown is that each solvent has a

608
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:32,940
unique ability to do something different

609
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:34,500
than its counterpart we have shown that

610
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,778
there are some better than others in

611
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,429
specific categories but and we've also

612
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:40,109
shown that there are far more variables

613
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:42,269
and extraction that are still to be

614
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:44,219
found out I think that the fact that

615
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:47,700
every body and every cancer is unique

616
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,558
that a combination approach is

617
00:26:47,700 --> 00:27:06,679
absolutely necessary and far more

618
00:26:49,558 --> 00:27:11,389
research is needed thank you yeah I

619
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:15,480
should have told you can we turn the

620
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:19,620
screen off for now so so with that

621
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:23,038
background what I'd like to do is is is

622
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:27,509
is ask some questions of the panel dr.

623
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:31,558
Hogan rather alluded to how to sum the

624
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:34,140
ratio of THC to CBD how do we know when

625
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:36,859
when to give more THC are there

626
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:43,490
situations where we want to give more

627
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:46,558
CBD than then THC how do we learn if if

628
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:52,308
how do we decide how much of each

629
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,308
cannabinoid to use anybody

630
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,660
in a situation like that if I were asked

631
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:02,429
that question by a patient I would try

632
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,509
to go to the literature and see what

633
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:10,049
Christina or daddy or Manuel Guzman has

634
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:11,609
done previously that indicated that

635
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:14,639
there was a preference for a particular

636
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:18,029
cap cannabinoid or whether there

637
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:21,090
actually had been combinations tried

638
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:23,069
before additionally I have the benefit

639
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:25,829
of having a large network of friends

640
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:28,259
that I can ask about this kind of thing

641
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:30,659
I would additionally look for any

642
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:34,549
synergies that might be present in the

643
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:37,710
turpenoid literature but as we've seen

644
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:41,039
sometimes it's not not so clear but

645
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:43,380
first thing is to see what has been done

646
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:47,250
or what even might have been known

647
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,320
historically and what history tells us

648
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:52,140
that a lot of treatments of tumors in

649
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:54,929
the past were with what appeared to be

650
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:59,610
raw cannabis whether it would have been

651
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:01,920
CBD a predominant or THC a dominant and

652
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:06,019
as we find out in the last year from

653
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:11,460
another group in Spain Nadal at all that

654
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:14,490
THC a is a peep or gamma agonist so

655
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,390
that's a nuclear receptor that affects

656
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:20,789
gene transcription and may have a very

657
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:23,610
prominent role in treatment of cancer

658
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:27,659
but that still needs to be investigated

659
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:29,869
further thank you why I might might add

660
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:35,250
that one of the techniques that I have

661
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:37,819
been attracted to is that that we know

662
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:42,690
from from dr. Sean McCallister's work

663
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:45,629
that CBD down regulates the ID one gene

664
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:52,200
and the ID one gene is associated with

665
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:54,360
tumor growth and and metastasis so if

666
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,720
there's if if if searching the

667
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:05,269
literature shows that a particular tumor

668
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:16,579
routinely our level of ID one be a

669
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:35,589
good indication I spawned for me your

670
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:42,139
mics breaking I know how often how how

671
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:45,139
how often should the THC be taken in my

672
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:49,160
experience it's easy to give the

673
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:52,009
majority of the THC at bedtime because

674
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:55,910
the patient can sleep through the psycho

675
00:30:52,009 --> 00:31:00,670
activity but dr. Goldstein referred me

676
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:04,490
to an article of patient with with

677
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:08,720
lymphoblastic leukemia who expressed

678
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:11,329
blast cells that were not curtailed when

679
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,390
the THC was given twice daily but when

680
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:17,359
it was given every eight hours the the

681
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:20,270
blast cells fell so so I would like to

682
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:26,719
ask the question of the panel how often

683
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:29,299
should we give the THC and when I can

684
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,970
tell you what I do so for most of my

685
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:34,299
patients again with children it's a

686
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:37,519
little bit easier because they're

687
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:40,609
they're usually not losing function that

688
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:44,779
most of us would not want to give up by

689
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:47,119
driving a car you know functioning if

690
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:48,980
the family expresses to me that they

691
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:52,309
want their child to still go to school

692
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,589
and to function well at school I will

693
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:56,000
have them take THC in the afternoon when

694
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:58,609
they get home from school and then in

695
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,319
the evenings if it's a child who's not

696
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:01,939
going to school which as you know if

697
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,579
they have cancer many of them are not

698
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,289
attending school I usually recommend THC

699
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:10,009
every eight hours along with the other

700
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:13,430
oil CBD and the raw cannabinoids and now

701
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:15,599
I've added in CBG as well I'm probably

702
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:18,029
and I tell people this I'm aggressive

703
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,250
and I often over treat but I'm terrified

704
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:22,288
to under treat to be perfectly honest

705
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:25,349
because again children tolerate

706
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:29,429
cannabinoids very well and I find that

707
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:31,439
really the only downside is on is the

708
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:33,269
cost at most families if we're getting

709
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,150
somewhere with with the cannabinoid

710
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:37,829
treatment I don't if we actually can get

711
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:41,090
to a point where the cancer is gone we

712
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:44,819
can back up and go to more affordable

713
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:46,678
doses so again much of it if they're

714
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,379
very small it doesn't cost that much to

715
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:52,320
give a fair at high dose but in general

716
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,210
in children again THC I often recommend

717
00:32:52,319 --> 00:33:00,288
that every eight hours we don't have a

718
00:32:54,210 --> 00:33:01,470
lot of clinical really very few clinical

719
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:06,480
trials

720
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:08,190
to really hang our hat on how long the

721
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,779
cannabinoids are going to hang around in

722
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:12,029
any particular person with Jeff's

723
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:14,668
experience with patients just smoking

724
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:16,649
and getting results certainly we know

725
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:18,419
that when you inhale it's not doesn't

726
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:21,179
last in your body a very long and

727
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:22,770
certainly not at high doses so it

728
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:24,900
certainly has to do a lot with the

729
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:28,859
sensitivity of the tumors as well to

730
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:31,259
exactly what they're taking I would

731
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:35,029
concur with dr. goldstein

732
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:39,058
if I can get a patient to take a THC CBD

733
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:41,668
balanced medication in three times a day

734
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:44,759
I'll encourage them to do that if it

735
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:46,230
doesn't work into their life plans if

736
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,319
they're going to pick up the kids at

737
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:52,589
2:00 in the afternoon then take the CBD

738
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:56,158
in the morning and reserve this THC for

739
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:59,399
later in the day so I I do encourage

740
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,620
that often right from the start I in

741
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,548
California under the under the laws that

742
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:05,158
we have today

743
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:07,048
I tell people right from the get-go you

744
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,710
you need to start thinking about growing

745
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:12,980
your own medicine the cost of these

746
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:16,019
molecules have gotten so expensive

747
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,019
maminta are gonna be taking a dropper of

748
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:21,389
dropper full of cannabinoids three times

749
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:24,179
a day and I say no you're we're talking

750
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:26,340
about a bottle of an ounce bottle of

751
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,490
cannabinoids a couple times

752
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:31,769
cost is absolutely prohibitive in this

753
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,709
kind of dosing so I really encourage

754
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:37,530
people to talk to friends and consider

755
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,659
growing their own medicine again

756
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,880
multiple cultivars I think are very

757
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,250
important and the opportunity again to

758
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,400
get acid cannabinoids into the mix I

759
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:50,940
think also is really valuable thank you

760
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:54,690
so I want to say something maybe to be

761
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,960
the bad boy on this panel we don't know

762
00:34:54,690 --> 00:35:01,470
that's the truth okay so the answers

763
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,720
here was how to give cannabis that the

764
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:06,149
patient will be comfortable we're not

765
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:07,829
treating a patient how to patient to be

766
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,800
comfortable we want to kill the cancer

767
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:13,199
so when a physician give chemotherapy is

768
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,870
not an saying if you can drive or not

769
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,819
drive

770
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:20,609
we don't know every answer will be good

771
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:22,650
as the other answer we don't we don't

772
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,360
know what the patient needs to get we

773
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,820
don't know if it's accumulating the

774
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,740
tumor so in the mice I can tell you that

775
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,780
they see accumulation of cannabinoid in

776
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:35,699
the tumors it's like stuck there is it

777
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:37,320
this true for patients do we need THC in

778
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:39,809
the evening do we know it CBD in the

779
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,870
morning the truth that we don't know so

780
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:47,969
every answer will be as good as the

781
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:50,670
other answer Kristine Sanchez and me

782
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:53,699
like the scientists we know that we cure

783
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:56,639
every types of cancer in minds so it's

784
00:35:53,699 --> 00:36:00,179
not true for people so there is a huge

785
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,789
gap between killing cells in the plate

786
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:06,809
killing tumors in the mice and treating

787
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:09,059
a person's and the correlation so far

788
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:10,619
that even if we learn about it in the

789
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:13,079
mice we won't know how to treat the

790
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,420
patient before we'll do real clinical

791
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,909
trials checking this kind of thing so

792
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,010
the truth in all these conferences

793
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:21,719
people are coming and asking what we

794
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,090
need to give the patient first of all we

795
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,849
don't know really that it's working we

796
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,140
are assuming we hoping and even if we

797
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:30,659
know we don't know what to give them

798
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:33,799
that's the truth that we can't run

799
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:38,478
around it thank you

800
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,479
[Applause]

801
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,280
how did

802
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:00,900
so I have another slide I have the slide

803
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:04,980
from your from your most recent paper in

804
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:10,048
nature and and and what you showed which

805
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:12,750
which is impressive and and so important

806
00:37:10,048 --> 00:37:16,920
and I'm so thankful that we have this

807
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:21,989
that you compared you compared 36

808
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:24,750
cultivars versus 94 cannabinoids and you

809
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:28,588
can see from from this top part of of

810
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:31,920
the other of the chart that that there

811
00:37:28,588 --> 00:37:34,318
are different cannabinoids in different

812
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,798
cultivars and they're all over the place

813
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,798
and

814
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:52,450
and also you I stole this slide from

815
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,869
your from your patients out of time

816
00:37:52,449 --> 00:38:05,919
presentation in May and this this shows

817
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:09,549
that this shows six different different

818
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,720
solvents and this this this confirms

819
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:15,920
what what

820
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:20,449
Dustin found so the the solvents here

821
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:24,260
the this the first six down here are the

822
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:27,859
same as the six across the top and here

823
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,920
are two cultivars extracted with six

824
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:34,730
different solvents and what we can see

825
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,940
is for example if we're looking for for

826
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:39,110
CBC bgv

827
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:43,579
we're not going to get it in this

828
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:48,579
cultivar with any any solvent but if we

829
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:53,199
take a cultivar that has that has that

830
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:57,739
cannabinoid we can extract it with with

831
00:38:53,199 --> 00:39:01,419
only butane and carbon dioxide not with

832
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:08,289
ethanol which which many of the fun

833
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:14,599
extracts are made with so so for for me

834
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:19,119
it's pointing in the direction of making

835
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:23,269
our medicine with multiple cultivars

836
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:28,179
extracted with multiple solvents in

837
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:30,980
order to get all the cannabinoids now

838
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:35,980
dr. Mary showed us in his presentation

839
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:39,320
this afternoon that there were a few key

840
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:42,079
compounds that were necessary to kill

841
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:45,440
the cancer so I'm wondering if you would

842
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,630
comment on the the

843
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,818
benefits or potential benefits or lack

844
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,970
of benefit of of making these

845
00:39:49,818 --> 00:39:56,300
combinations of multiple cultivars and

846
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:58,848
multiple solvents yeah I'd like to take

847
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:01,700
that one initially for me it's easy

848
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:02,990
there are only two possibilities ethanol

849
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:05,539
or co2

850
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:09,259
I have little confidence and the ability

851
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:12,079
to totally purge of these other solvents

852
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,119
many of which are toxic additionally

853
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,250
there are a lot of people out in public

854
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,950
that think that they can do a home

855
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:21,650
extraction with butane and they blow

856
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:25,669
themselves up in the process is the

857
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:28,519
story I told on Monday that the safe

858
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,039
ones are ethanol and co2 extraction

859
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:35,119
obviously for the latter you need some

860
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:38,300
very technical equipment but I I just

861
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:43,519
don't see the place for the others

862
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:45,650
myself ethanol is just as flammable and

863
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,358
I've seen very big fires for methanol

864
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:49,519
just throw that out there yeah I don't

865
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:55,608
recommend the patients do this at all

866
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:58,699
but I can add something I completely

867
00:40:55,608 --> 00:41:00,619
agree with Ethan and we have to keep in

868
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:03,409
mind that we are talking about patients

869
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:06,349
that take this medicine on a daily basis

870
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:08,929
several times a day doing very prolonged

871
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:10,760
periods of time so if you have a tiny

872
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:12,949
little bit of something that is below

873
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,890
detection limits in your sophisticated

874
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:18,618
equipment but if you accumulate that a

875
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:22,309
little bit of something three times a

876
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:23,960
day every day for months for years that

877
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:27,409
tiny little bit becomes something

878
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,510
important so I could be with you so I

879
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:31,549
just want to say it for my defense first

880
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,859
of all it's like hitting the experts I

881
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:37,550
don't remember these figures it's a long

882
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:40,549
time ago but second this is academic

883
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:43,160
work and this is not coming to treat any

884
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:45,500
patients and for sure that there are

885
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:48,409
solvent there which are poisoned just to

886
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:51,679
showing the different solvent create

887
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:54,139
different extracts it doesn't I don't

888
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,579
want nobody to treat with these solvents

889
00:41:54,139 --> 00:42:02,389
patients

890
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:03,710
and I think what Christian and then like

891
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:06,710
the people here said it's extremely

892
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,360
important when you're doing extract you

893
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:11,389
need to think about the solvent what is

894
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:14,210
left with the patient and regarding your

895
00:42:11,389 --> 00:42:16,900
questions so when you are mixing

896
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:19,460
different cultivars you diluting

897
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,730
compounds so it's true that you have

898
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,949
higher variability but you're diluting

899
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,050
the compounds and again I don't have the

900
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:30,349
answer what is good and bad to the

901
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:32,390
patient I just know what is the action

902
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:35,539
that we are doing and what is the result

903
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:38,089
and I think the physicians here have

904
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:42,710
much much more experience how to treat

905
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:45,410
the patient sobani and we don't we were

906
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:48,730
far away from knowing you know in this

907
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:52,670
we just showing the complexity and how

908
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:56,599
how much we don't know but we have good

909
00:42:52,670 --> 00:43:01,579
answers I guess so so dr. Lisa would you

910
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:04,329
would you think that that combining co2

911
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:07,880
and alcohol extracts might provide

912
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:09,469
better patient outcomes possibly but

913
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:14,510
again you know I'd want to see some

914
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:19,969
evidence a rationale behind combining to

915
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:22,550
get those specific components so I say I

916
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:25,099
want to say something about fire and an

917
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:28,519
ethanol when I started to do extraction

918
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:31,309
I look to to find a method in PubMed

919
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:35,840
it's usually where scientists look for

920
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:37,759
evidence and there was no good way to do

921
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,090
the ethanol extraction so I went to

922
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,380
YouTube's

923
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:44,269
first of all I I thought that I'm the

924
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,849
first one there doing extra ethanol

925
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:48,710
expert extraction without the two-second

926
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:51,199
the guy said the most important thing

927
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,590
when you're doing the extraction don't

928
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:53,589
smoke

929
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:03,769
thank you

930
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:09,470
and wondered since you used ether in

931
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:11,539
your lab did anybody go to sleep I used

932
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:16,879
ether yes

933
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:29,269
the first solvent it's it's may explain

934
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:32,720
why this student was very slow so so one

935
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:36,400
of the one of the things that intrigued

936
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:40,639
me from from dr. Sanchez's recent paper

937
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,700
was the the lack of emphasis efficacy in

938
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:47,269
in adding back the terpenes now she she

939
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:51,129
added back five terpenes two of those in

940
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:53,539
in dr. Russo's publication on on

941
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:56,869
antineoplastic terpenes only two of the

942
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:59,690
five were designated as as

943
00:44:56,869 --> 00:45:05,089
antineoplastic little rule and alpha

944
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:07,369
humulin so what that triggered in my

945
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:09,140
mind is when we talk about the entourage

946
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:12,769
I've always thought of the entourage

947
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:16,699
being the terpenes but I'm wondering if

948
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:19,699
it's not as much or more so the minor

949
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:22,219
cannabinoids that make up the full

950
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:26,500
entourage and and and what I was

951
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:28,969
thinking about in the combining the the

952
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:32,630
extractions from multiple cultivars and

953
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:35,029
and with multiple solvents was enhancing

954
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:37,789
the entourage if you had compounds that

955
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:41,060
were not present in one cultivar you

956
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:43,940
could bring them into play and and and

957
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:47,150
and even though it's it's diluted if you

958
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:50,420
standardize for THC and CBD its diluted

959
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:53,720
but but maybe maybe in that that slide

960
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:57,050
that the last presentation the small

961
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:58,669
amount of CB GA was what made the

962
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:01,250
difference and maybe it doesn't take

963
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,920
very much maybe it's a catalyst rather

964
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:05,460
than a

965
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:10,740
a true act activator of anyway I

966
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:15,139
appreciate your comments on that you yes

967
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:17,879
please sure it's an intriguing question

968
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:21,029
one of the things I noted when I read

969
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:25,318
Cristina's paper from her group was that

970
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:28,500
there was no detected limonene limonene

971
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:31,009
e actually has had observed activity at

972
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:34,469
least in vitro and in breast cancer

973
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:36,799
there was a study done in humans of

974
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:39,629
high-dose limonene in breast cancer

975
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:41,789
unfortunately it didn't read out and my

976
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:47,400
impression of that was while they forgot

977
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:50,969
the cannabinoids so yeah certainly when

978
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:54,119
I thought it did relate to minor

979
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:56,368
cannabinoids and again given what

980
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:58,858
Cristina said in relation to my question

981
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:02,548
I'm really I have a strong hunch at this

982
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:09,358
point that THC a is responsible for the

983
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:11,818
difference from THC alone so I want to

984
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:15,509
comment about the terpenes I think we

985
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:17,130
all think the terpenes are important I'm

986
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:20,309
speaking by myself so I think the

987
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:24,720
terpenes are important but I know even

988
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:27,269
mine what are you thinking and I'm quite

989
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,519
disappointing so one of the first thing

990
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:31,679
that we're doing in the lab when we see

991
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:35,009
phenomenon would cut the terpenes out to

992
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:37,409
see if it's affected and except for

993
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:40,140
sleep disorders that we have a mice

994
00:47:37,409 --> 00:47:43,230
model for sleep disorders that we do see

995
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:46,618
the terpenes important in epilepsy in

996
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:50,250
the cancer models in the other models I

997
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:52,140
didn't find that they are important so

998
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:54,420
every time that we cut them out it

999
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:57,269
doesn't affect the phenomena which is

1000
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:00,150
extremely disappointing for me but these

1001
00:47:57,269 --> 00:48:02,460
are the results for now so again except

1002
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:05,789
sleep disorder I didn't find anything

1003
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,710
that they were in the mice model and

1004
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:11,849
then with the cell model that there

1005
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:14,568
Turpin's was very effective so that's

1006
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:14,568
the results

1007
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:23,449
so so a quick question yes him a

1008
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:33,050
legitimate source of CBD in

1009
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:36,569
antineoplastic protocols I didn't but I

1010
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:40,320
didn't get the question I want to know

1011
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:44,580
if we can use him it's very difficult

1012
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:48,809
for some patients in Europe to get to

1013
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:52,710
get high CBD cultivars for their

1014
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:56,759
medicine it's virtually impossible I do

1015
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:59,460
some consults from Europe or worth

1016
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:02,880
patients in Europe it's also difficult

1017
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:07,099
in many areas in the United States to

1018
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:09,990
get ac/dc and and and other high CBD

1019
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:13,759
cultivars and I'm wondering but but hemp

1020
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:16,709
seems to be much more available and and

1021
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:20,940
I've looked at some of the the lab work

1022
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:23,730
on on the lab analyses of hemp extracts

1023
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:26,610
and they there are some that do have a

1024
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:29,159
rich terpene profile and have

1025
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:32,880
substantial amounts of CBD and I'm

1026
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:40,710
wondering if that is a a potential

1027
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:42,450
source of CBD maybe however I think

1028
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,000
they're going to spend a fortune in the

1029
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:48,750
bargain given the kinds of prices I've

1030
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,489
seen you know a lot of this is a

1031
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:56,059
byproduct of prohibition let's be clear

1032
00:49:52,489 --> 00:50:00,389
you know the there are better ways a

1033
00:49:56,059 --> 00:50:03,809
dedicated what we'd call drug keema var

1034
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:09,269
that's rich in in CBD is likely going to

1035
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:12,000
be preferable plus with a hemp extract

1036
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:14,639
so-called generally we're not talking

1037
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,400
about any significant amount of THC and

1038
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:21,949
for most tumors that's a necessary

1039
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,950
component right right

1040
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:31,660
I'm just thinking about the the the CBD

1041
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:34,150
component what I've seen from a lot of

1042
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:36,069
CVD extracts is that in a raw CBD

1043
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:39,400
extract and ethanol extract if you will

1044
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:42,940
is that you can see THC get into the 3

1045
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,829
to 5 percent range on that which for

1046
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,360
some patients I've seen some really good

1047
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:49,090
responses to that one with some of my

1048
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,230
cancers but like you say it's still kind

1049
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:52,660
of out there I would like to have a lot

1050
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:55,329
more THC but for those people that don't

1051
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:56,859
have access to anything better I can't

1052
00:50:55,329 --> 00:51:00,909
see the harm and I think it could

1053
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:03,910
actually help and and and so a follow-up

1054
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:06,819
question on that is we've heard a lot of

1055
00:51:03,909 --> 00:51:10,379
talk about CB g + CB GA at this

1056
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:13,480
conference and it looks like it is

1057
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,280
turning out to be a useful cannabinoid

1058
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,490
that we ought to include in our

1059
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,670
antineoplastic protocols and would help

1060
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:28,049
be a good source of CB g years and CB g

1061
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:31,990
a wave one strain in the lab that have

1062
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:37,600
17% CB gene without tips in CBD almost

1063
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:41,229
at all like 0.2 CB t 0.4 CB g yes THC

1064
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,449
and this is a very potent strain so you

1065
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:46,530
see that there are cancer that being

1066
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:49,839
affected by that there is in the

1067
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:52,480
epilepsy model it's affecting like there

1068
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:55,600
is many models affected then again I

1069
00:51:52,480 --> 00:52:00,219
don't know if it's just CPG but for sure

1070
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:02,259
this strain is very very potent strained

1071
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:06,069
for many things and I believe that CB

1072
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:09,840
G's as potent as tits in CBD it's

1073
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:14,320
usually not in high percentage but I

1074
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:16,930
guess again my belief that T it's in CBD

1075
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:19,269
is a little bit covering for the others

1076
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:21,759
but if you eliminate them there will be

1077
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:23,530
other cannabinoids with high affinity to

1078
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,050
the receptors and they can be very

1079
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:28,048
potent if they will be in the percentage

1080
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:32,009
of the states in CBD in

1081
00:52:28,048 --> 00:52:34,139
as we and we usually see them so it

1082
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:35,998
might be that there are other what we

1083
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:38,038
call minor cannabinoid that if there

1084
00:52:35,998 --> 00:52:40,169
will be in high percentage have higher

1085
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:42,059
affinity to the receptor so we call it

1086
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:44,729
affinity of an avidity how much it's

1087
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:47,278
binding the receptors and we see that

1088
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:50,188
there is minor cannabinoid with very

1089
00:52:47,278 --> 00:52:53,039
strong activity on the receptors and

1090
00:52:50,188 --> 00:52:55,528
just amount I believe that in the

1091
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:57,150
cultivars and then they think that

1092
00:52:55,528 --> 00:52:59,969
people are doing we will find more and

1093
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:02,639
more strains that have different

1094
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:06,568
cannabinoids that are expressed there is

1095
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:09,150
already like THC v strain with 10 and 11

1096
00:53:06,568 --> 00:53:10,978
percent of THC v which is extremely

1097
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:13,489
psychoactive people think that that just

1098
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:17,669
eight sees psychoactive to achieve is

1099
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:19,739
also very psychoactive but we will see

1100
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:22,170
more and more cultivars with different

1101
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:26,239
cannabinoid expression and different

1102
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:29,309
effects I already I already see that

1103
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:31,139
people think that they can send

1104
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:39,170
everything to my lab in FedEx and they

1105
00:53:31,139 --> 00:53:41,248
are right so I see a lot of things I've

1106
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:44,039
because of my work with children with

1107
00:53:41,248 --> 00:53:45,568
autism and families of course searching

1108
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:47,939
for products that might help their

1109
00:53:45,568 --> 00:53:50,579
children I've learned about a couple of

1110
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:54,989
CBG actually three CBG products

1111
00:53:50,579 --> 00:54:00,420
available here in california two of them

1112
00:53:54,989 --> 00:54:02,519
are very very low THC so can be sold

1113
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:05,039
across state lines is kind of under the

1114
00:54:02,518 --> 00:54:07,948
hemp but we've gotten them tested at

1115
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:13,890
multiple labs and they one runs about

1116
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:15,599
50% CBG with about 2% CBD and I can't

1117
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:18,900
remember what the THC it was very very

1118
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,239
low and one of the other ones I'm

1119
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,369
waiting on lab tests and then one is a

1120
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:26,068
sublingual tablet that you can get in 3

1121
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:28,650
milligram amounts and we've have that

1122
00:54:26,068 --> 00:54:30,630
pending right now in a lab test so CBG

1123
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:32,278
is becoming available I'm sure there's

1124
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:34,048
going to be more products on the market

1125
00:54:32,278 --> 00:54:36,478
if you're interested in using it and

1126
00:54:34,048 --> 00:54:38,009
there is some an article and maybe Joe

1127
00:54:36,478 --> 00:54:38,788
you can share that with people the

1128
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:43,699
article that

1129
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:52,799
talked about CBG for colon cancer yep

1130
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:55,199
I'd like to can you here with me yeah

1131
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:57,809
you can in right now so you you said

1132
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,909
that you you suggested the patients

1133
00:54:57,809 --> 00:55:01,109
throw a couple of buds in their smoothie

1134
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:04,348
in the morning to get the raw

1135
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:07,348
cannabinoids there is there is a pretty

1136
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:12,419
extensive literature for the raw

1137
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:14,910
cannabinoids that the CBG a has I think

1138
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:18,268
I found five articles showing that it

1139
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:21,989
had benefit for breast cancer doctor

1140
00:55:18,268 --> 00:55:25,528
Mary has shown some experience with THC

1141
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:27,929
a and and prostate cancer but in in in

1142
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:30,809
your slides when you when you showed

1143
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:34,559
that in one of your YouTube videos it

1144
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:39,179
turned out that that THC a also killed

1145
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:42,919
the glioblastoma cells in in in vitro if

1146
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:46,289
not next to next to the the

1147
00:55:42,918 --> 00:55:50,568
decarboxylated THC the THC a was the

1148
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:57,119
second most potent cannabinoid so

1149
00:55:50,568 --> 00:56:00,298
there's also literature on CB GA and and

1150
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:07,588
and and there's paper sawn on colon

1151
00:56:00,298 --> 00:56:10,650
cancer with with with DHEA and and CBG a

1152
00:56:07,588 --> 00:56:15,478
and so I'm wondering if we should

1153
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:20,039
include raw cannabinoids in in a formal

1154
00:56:15,478 --> 00:56:23,278
way in in our cancer protocols so so I'm

1155
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:25,769
just envisioning that that since they're

1156
00:56:23,278 --> 00:56:29,338
not psychoactive the patient could take

1157
00:56:25,768 --> 00:56:32,488
the the CBD and raw cannabinoids during

1158
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:35,818
the day and take a big dose of THC at

1159
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:36,630
bedtime and get all of the get a really

1160
00:56:35,818 --> 00:56:40,199
full

1161
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:43,499
entourage of compounds to fight the

1162
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:48,340
cancer and and I would like to here's

1163
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:54,799
the can the panel is response to that

1164
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:56,630
yeah great share it around so so

1165
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,550
throwing a few buds into the blenders a

1166
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:01,789
pretty good way to do it if you can't

1167
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:05,930
make the oil and and there's not many

1168
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:08,989
many products available in the

1169
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:15,919
dispensary that have a full complement

1170
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:18,199
of cannabinoids so I want to say two

1171
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,740
things yes there are cancers that been

1172
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:23,239
affected by the acid form of the

1173
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:25,129
cannabis and I don't know if it's the

1174
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:31,819
acid form or other terpenes I didn't

1175
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:34,789
they sect it yet to know the major cell

1176
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:38,330
lines that we checked were more affected

1177
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:41,059
by the Decker box elated but there are a

1178
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:43,190
few of them in prostate cancer is one of

1179
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:46,670
them and being highly affected by the

1180
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:50,119
acid form we need to remember that the

1181
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:52,550
acid form is the native form and if they

1182
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:55,099
on the plant so the plant not creating

1183
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:58,070
they it creating THC and there is a

1184
00:57:55,099 --> 00:58:01,909
logic to think that there is a role for

1185
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:05,019
that you know in animal receptors if

1186
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:10,789
it's kind of defense or attract

1187
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:13,639
mechanism for the plant and but usually

1188
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:16,009
they are less potent than the active

1189
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:21,349
form like the decarboxylated from that

1190
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:23,390
at least in our results if the patient

1191
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:27,049
can eat cannabis like that it's not

1192
00:58:23,389 --> 00:58:32,150
affected so the is-8 and said why not so

1193
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:37,039
I want to say like you you same thing

1194
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:39,590
that are more related to two United

1195
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:42,619
States in Israel we don't have a problem

1196
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:44,780
of the amounts of the plant the patient

1197
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:48,980
they are not paying for that it's not

1198
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:51,080
related to a price the pain fixed price

1199
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:54,530
doesn't matter how much they are getting

1200
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:55,969
they can get 600 gram and months or 2

1201
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:58,849
grams a months it's this

1202
00:58:55,969 --> 00:59:01,730
amount for them we don't have a problem

1203
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:04,730
of CBD cultivars they can choose so

1204
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:06,829
every girl will have at least one high

1205
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:09,380
CBD cultivars and they can choose and

1206
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:11,869
can have it so all of these problems we

1207
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:14,780
don't have it just we don't know what is

1208
00:59:11,869 --> 00:59:18,050
good to give them but if we know it was

1209
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:21,460
available for the patients so do you

1210
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:23,450
routinely use the THC a now with

1211
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:27,500
recommended to patients with prostate

1212
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:33,009
cancer my patient have four legs and a

1213
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:37,250
tail I'm not a physician

1214
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:40,520
I'm routinely tried checking it in my

1215
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:43,820
lab on this the models that I have I'm

1216
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:46,099
not I'm not offering your patient and

1217
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:48,710
I'm trying to avoid it I think you know

1218
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:51,580
people that are experienced and

1219
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:54,139
physicians should take these decisions

1220
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:58,389
one minute can I make a quick comment

1221
00:59:54,139 --> 01:00:01,009
sure sure so I think ultimately you know

1222
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:03,019
there's a huge amount of research that

1223
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:04,220
has to be done including clinical trials

1224
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:06,289
and one of the biggest problems of

1225
01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:08,118
course is the schedule 1 status so any

1226
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:10,309
chance you get to try to talk to any

1227
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:12,320
politicians if you're if you know people

1228
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:18,559
we have to get it D scheduled so that we

1229
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:21,680
can do the research period we live in

1230
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,869
chaos where CBD is still a Schedule one

1231
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:25,519
drug if it comes from a pharmaceutical

1232
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:28,190
company just recently now it's a

1233
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:30,530
Schedule five but how do and then

1234
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:32,720
there's a patent right on THC by the

1235
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:34,130
government for neuroprotection but yet

1236
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:35,809
it's still a Schedule one so that it's

1237
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:39,920
utter chaos and that has to get sorted

1238
01:00:35,809 --> 01:00:42,259
out but ultimately having the science

1239
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,480
that that dedi and

1240
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:47,720
and Christina are doing is so very

1241
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,130
important but at the same time what

1242
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:50,929
we're being warned about over and over

1243
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:53,750
is not to take their results and then

1244
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:56,210
apply it to human beings because that is

1245
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:58,309
not that that's not linked it's the

1246
01:00:56,210 --> 01:01:01,480
initial findings what we're seeing is

1247
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:04,460
sure maybe it it definitely helps in

1248
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,079
breast cancer cells in a test tube and

1249
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,750
then also in mice but again remember

1250
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,210
we're missing clinical trials for Jeff

1251
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:13,429
and I that tree human beings that come

1252
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:16,369
into our offices we offer the best that

1253
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:19,279
we can there is no one protocol that's

1254
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:21,679
going to work for everybody I I had the

1255
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:26,240
unfortunate well I guess it's a mixed

1256
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:28,909
experience I've seen two teenagers with

1257
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:32,679
the same exact stage for osteosarcoma

1258
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:35,989
it's very similar stories one young man

1259
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:37,789
the family was very motivated they took

1260
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:41,179
high-dose oils and that young man

1261
01:01:37,789 --> 01:01:42,829
survived and he was diagnosed at age 14

1262
01:01:41,179 --> 01:01:44,869
was probably not going to make it till

1263
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:47,090
17th birthday and he just turned 20

1264
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:49,219
about a month ago but at the same time I

1265
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:52,579
had another case referred from the same

1266
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:55,849
oncologist who the family came and I

1267
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:57,769
gave a very similar protocol and they

1268
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:59,989
just had a really hard time giving the

1269
01:01:57,769 --> 01:02:01,280
oil whether a psychosocial situation or

1270
01:01:59,989 --> 01:02:04,879
the child didn't want to take it and

1271
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:07,390
that boy died so there there's you you

1272
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:10,130
you can't conclude very much other than

1273
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:12,019
there is certainly a chance and what

1274
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,640
we're seeing I know dr. Hagen rather

1275
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,980
night better quality of life

1276
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:19,519
maybe extension of life for certain

1277
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:21,320
patients and certainly an ability to

1278
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:23,840
give somebody some hope and to move

1279
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:26,210
forward despite the diagnosis of cancer

1280
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,850
and sometimes very devastating cancer

1281
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:32,780
diagnosis but at the same time there is

1282
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:33,949
no one magical protocol that seems to

1283
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,360
work for everybody

1284
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:38,419
despite the fact that you may have the

1285
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:41,090
same cancer or the same type of cancer

1286
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:42,980
you have to remember that we're still

1287
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:44,750
very early in the stages of this and I

1288
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,340
don't think that I'm sure a lot of

1289
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,750
people came to this panel saying well I

1290
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:49,789
want to know what to take or what to

1291
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:52,139
recommend to my mother-in-law but at the

1292
01:02:49,789 --> 01:02:55,860
same time what I'll tell you is that

1293
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:57,989
there's no reason not to try if you sir

1294
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:00,030
if you certainly have an advanced cancer

1295
01:02:57,989 --> 01:03:03,359
or certainly if it doesn't look good for

1296
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:04,740
you because we are out of time but if

1297
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:08,539
you want to take one question from the

1298
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:11,429
audience will be we can we can do that I

1299
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:13,559
want just to say that there is few

1300
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:16,619
clinical trials in Israel that running

1301
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:19,739
now with cannabis and cancer there is

1302
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:21,949
like three weeks seems some like there

1303
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:24,599
is one on glioblastoma and thank this

1304
01:03:21,949 --> 01:03:26,849
data that will come from there we start

1305
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:28,980
to give better hints and I totally agree

1306
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:30,869
the Bonnie that you know you can

1307
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,940
conclude for the mice and from the cell

1308
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:35,400
lines how to treat patients but I think

1309
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:38,639
from these researchers will be better

1310
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,829
and I admire these physicians that treat

1311
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:43,920
the patient and and take the advantage

1312
01:03:40,829 --> 01:03:47,849
as they said it's not toxic and there is

1313
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:54,420
no it's even if it's give a little hope

1314
01:03:47,849 --> 01:03:56,400
to the patients were see you all for in

1315
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:59,099
your own way pointing out what we don't

1316
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,780
know which I think forces us to zoom out

1317
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:02,940
and use more of a Systems Theory

1318
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,040
approach when it comes to working with

1319
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,420
patients what I didn't hear and I'm

1320
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,630
wondering if some of you could comment

1321
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:11,460
on would be cautions or

1322
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:13,769
contraindications from using cannabis

1323
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:17,010
and patients that say might be doing

1324
01:04:13,769 --> 01:04:20,179
immunotherapy or based on some animal

1325
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:23,880
data that just came out this month from

1326
01:04:20,179 --> 01:04:31,019
Lopez Valero at all showing that CBD may

1327
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:36,780
reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen decay

1328
01:04:31,019 --> 01:04:38,159
shion's to offer I can make a comment so

1329
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,140
when a patient comes in of course

1330
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:41,759
they're required to supply me with the

1331
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:43,909
list of medications that are taking

1332
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,860
including and in chemotherapy or any new

1333
01:04:43,909 --> 01:04:48,869
immunotherapies one of the things that I

1334
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,849
find helpful is that you can call a

1335
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:53,369
pharmaceutical company they're always

1336
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:54,170
open to questions and if you ask them

1337
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:56,598
have there been

1338
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:58,789
of course drug drug interactions with

1339
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:01,430
anything like CBD is usually the big one

1340
01:04:58,789 --> 01:05:04,420
that we find interactions and for some

1341
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:07,969
of my patients if they're on a

1342
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:09,680
medication and their oncologist wants

1343
01:05:07,969 --> 01:05:12,409
them to take that sometimes I'll tell

1344
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:14,960
them you know you can take low doses of

1345
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:17,989
cannabinoids to try to mitigate side

1346
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,880
effects however it may not be in your

1347
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:22,038
best interest to take high doses of

1348
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,750
cannabinoids right now if it's either

1349
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:25,220
going to clear that drug out of their

1350
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:28,099
system quicker or actually allow that

1351
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:30,230
drug to accumulate and create toxicity

1352
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:32,990
so we have to be very careful because

1353
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:34,880
the vast majority of patients that are

1354
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:37,879
coming in now and I'm sure Jeff can say

1355
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,430
this too are choosing treatment they're

1356
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,380
not coming at the last resort like it

1357
01:05:40,429 --> 01:05:44,239
used to be maybe about five or eight

1358
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,858
years ago most people that are coming in

1359
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:50,179
are actually coming in fairly early and

1360
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:53,048
so now it's created this review of all

1361
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:55,489
medications because many of them are

1362
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:56,719
interested in combination therapy and

1363
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:58,909
that's why it's important that

1364
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:01,159
especially now that there's legalization

1365
01:05:58,909 --> 01:06:03,348
in our state here in California that

1366
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:08,808
someone over 21 doesn't self-medicate

1367
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:10,400
while they're on a oncology protocol

1368
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:13,250
because they could actually make

1369
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,070
themselves toxic on medication doesn't

1370
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:18,760
have the round of applause for our panel

1371
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:18,760
[Applause]
