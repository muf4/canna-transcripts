to be here i regard this as my coming

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,599
out post pandemic

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,719
yeah and with that said how nice is it

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,759
to be back

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,880
um in person at a meeting like canmed

13
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,280
and what are you hoping to get out of

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,679
this event well it's familiar but novel

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,200
at the same time we've all been cooped

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,000
up for a couple of years this would be

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,480
my first in-person presentation although

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,238
we've made good use of zoom

19
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,799
for presentations all over the world

20
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,640
so you know i found out i don't have to

21
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,799
be there but i certainly wanted to be

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,359
there for this yeah and again what is it

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,358
about an in-person event that

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,558
makes it better than you know zoom which

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,640
we've been living with for the past

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,280
three years well you don't have the

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,560
ability to network

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,799
on zoom

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,159
the same way you know it's not just the

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,600
meeting it's the uh little get-togethers

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,920
in a

32
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,039
quiet room afterwards or dinners

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,118
together

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
uh the chance to really get to know your

35
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,280
collaborators

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,799
all that you know that's irreplaceable

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
right yeah the business really takes

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
place between the talks sure

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,159
excellent and now are there any

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,000
presentations at this year's event that

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,880
you're looking forward to oh there's so

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
many

43
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,640
uh of course professor mishulam

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
my spiritual uncle and all this

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,799
um

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,118
dustin sulak bonnie goldstein

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,118
um

48
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,078
yeah stacy gruber

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,719
so many yeah no i didn't mean to put you

50
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,399
on the spot if she's curious and um so

51
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,078
your keynote presentation it's titled

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,478
cannabis and psychiatry the final

53
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,399
frontier and um i have to admit i'm a

54
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,280
little curious about the final frontier

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,799
part

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,399
because certainly there must be some

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,920
additional frontiers that we've yet to

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,080
conquer with cannabis medicine yeah

59
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,039
there are the other notable one would be

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,040
the area of obstetrics and gynecology

61
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,840
now what they have in common is these

62
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,439
were

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,039
very

64
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,520
commonly

65
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,959
indications for cannabis-based medicine

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
in the past

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,959
historically the literature from the

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,120
19th century and even before pointed to

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,759
those areas as

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,759
being ones where cannabis-based medicine

71
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,799
was very effective

72
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,359
particularly for psychiatry though

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,200
it's sort of a forbidden territory yet

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,959
same with obstetrics and gynecology

75
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,280
most psychiatrists are extremely

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,360
conservative

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,680
particularly about the

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,000
idea of a drug of abuse i.e cannabis

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,599
that can be used therapeutically but i

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,959
think many of them are unfamiliar with

81
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,878
the history

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,158
and they're also thinking in terms of

83
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,639
what they've seen

84
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,039
which is really abuse

85
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,919
related to thc

86
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,560
but

87
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,039
there's more to cannabis than just thc

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,120
right and the real

89
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,439
contributions are going to come from

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,000
additional components

91
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,359
with maybe just a touch of thc yeah i

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,598
was going to ask you that i mean because

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,519
obviously thc is the the known

94
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,439
psychoactive compound so is that sort of

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,360
essential to be

96
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,598
used here no they're preparations for

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,480
instance there have been a couple of

98
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:42,158
randomized controlled phase 2 trials

99
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,039
of cannabidiol as an isolate

100
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,759
in

101
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,158
treating schizophrenia quite effectively

102
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,878
but the doses were so high eight hundred

103
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:54,479
to a thousand milligrams i think that we

104
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:57,359
could do a lot better with less making

105
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,119
it more accessible and less expensive by

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,560
having other components particularly

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,400
cannabidirl which i'll be talking about

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,239
in the keynote

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,640
that's a component of great promise

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,599
most people really haven't had access to

111
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,839
it

112
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,159
let alone knowledge of its potential

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,000
yeah so is that an example where you

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
know these additional compounds can sort

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
of

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,639
um when i talked with kevin spellman

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
about some of the pharmacology of the

118
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,759
different compounds he explained that

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,320
some of them are almost served as an

120
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,400
icebreaker where they can sort of help

121
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,079
with the penetration of the medicine so

122
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,079
is that an example of why you know the

123
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,279
entourage effect is so important well

124
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,159
it's just one factor among many yeah

125
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,198
but

126
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,600
you know i i named my paper taming thc

127
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,439
back in 2011 because

128
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,199
that really describes a lot of what

129
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,680
some of the minor cannabinoids and

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,360
terpenoids will do is increase the

131
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,120
therapeutic index of thc making it a

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,439
better more tolerable medicine

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
excellent okay and so i wanted to quote

134
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,279
from your abstract here you said that

135
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,240
the endocannabinoid system has a

136
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,159
critical

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,038
role in neurotransmission and

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,280
homeostasis of the limbic system can you

139
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,360
speak more about how endocannabinoids

140
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,000
and phytocannabinoids help regulate this

141
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,000
important area of the brain sure so the

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
limbic system are the emotional centers

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,959
of the brain of course

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,320
and what we find is there's a very high

145
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,599
density of the cb1 receptor where

146
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,839
thc

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,639
and the endocannabinoids and nanda mine

148
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,879
and two eric adonal glycerol work

149
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,759
so that that was a hint i mean when this

150
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,800
was established back in the 90s it was

151
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,840
obvious to some of us that boy there's a

152
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,800
real target there and this explains why

153
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:52,159
cannabis could be so effective for a

154
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,600
variety of psychiatric conditions

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,840
and really that's the foundation

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,560
then it just becomes a practical matter

157
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,758
of what do you use what's in it what's

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,439
the dose

159
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
on where is it going to be most

160
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,879
effective

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,080
that's what i'd like to be working on

162
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,759
you know for

163
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,038
the rest of my career right you've got

164
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,240
to conquer that frontier right hopefully

165
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,079
and i did want to bring up since we're

166
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,079
talking about psychiatry it's becoming a

167
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,599
bigger topic kind of in our circles and

168
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,439
we have a few presentations about it

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
here at this year's canmed

170
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:29,600
psilocybin and psychedelics

171
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,840
what role will they play in psychiatry

172
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
again great promise

173
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,679
there's been a resurgence of interest in

174
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,399
the psychedelics

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,720
just analogously to cannabis it's been

176
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,560
submerged for some decades because of

177
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,960
prohibition

178
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,879
but again i'd like to be a student of

179
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,038
medical history

180
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,719
back in the 50s and 60s there was some

181
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,478
tremendous research on psychedelics

182
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,199
for a variety conditions treating

183
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,000
addictions particularly alcoholism

184
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,400
uh intractable depression end-of-life

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,598
things the same kinds of things you're

186
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,478
here now

187
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,918
um

188
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:11,279
so it's interesting how there's been

189
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:14,639
sort of a transition uh from cannabis to

190
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,598
psychedelics uh and it may be that we've

191
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,038
got

192
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:21,199
psilocybin or mdma available

193
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,318
as pharmaceuticals

194
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,160
before there's better access to a wide

195
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,319
range of cannabis based pharmaceuticals

196
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,280
it's not a competition i'd like to see

197
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,598
both um

198
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,598
something i'd like to emphasize is most

199
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,000
of the current research on psychedelics

200
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,360
is focused on synthetics

201
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
or sim single molecules um i think that

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,000
there's synergy in the philosophy

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,680
mushrooms and many of the other

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,800
botanical sources of psychedelics and

205
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,519
i hope to focus more on those

206
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,400
uh rather than the isolates right so

207
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,159
again the entourage effect uh yeah if it

208
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,239
works for cannabis it should work in

209
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,800
this realm as well

210
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,120
excellent um and so in your abstract you

211
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,720
also mentioned you mentioned it here um

212
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,399
answering one of the earlier questions

213
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,479
of there being a long history of using

214
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,478
cannabis to treat mental conditions what

215
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,680
are some good examples of that

216
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:22,000
well it only goes back about 4 000 years

217
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,918
you know the sumerians uh there was a

218
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,720
listing of the attributes of what we

219
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,519
believe is cannabis i'm sure it is

220
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,520
but one of the the lines about this

221
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,519
plant was for

222
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,240
or against panic

223
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
and

224
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,799
that is the 4 000 year old demonstration

225
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,320
of the biphasic dose response curve of

226
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,039
cannabis meaning

227
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,959
at very low doses it's great for anxiety

228
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,919
a dose that's too high and induces

229
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,399
anxiety right there it is right there

230
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,679
so um that's a blueprint for everything

231
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,759
that

232
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,359
came before and hopefully will come

233
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,679
subsequently

234
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
another highlight would be um

235
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,799
jean-jacques monroe de tour in france on

236
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,000
the 1830s wrote a whole book

237
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,439
about the promise of cannabis

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
for treating

239
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
schizophrenia and other psychiatric

240
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,040
conditions

241
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,000
unfortunately the tradition didn't carry

242
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,199
through

243
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,720
to the modern day but we have a chance

244
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,959
to write that historical wrong

245
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,959
excellent okay and just in closing

246
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,799
before i let you go um

247
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,879
just curious that you know given that so

248
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,399
much of the research that goes into

249
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,320
medicinal cannabis

250
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
is done by privately funded companies

251
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,519
like your own

252
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
how important is it to come to events

253
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,360
like canmed and share that information

254
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
with the community because

255
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,399
not all companies are going to be as

256
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:53,119
forthcoming as as you and others well

257
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,440
again you have to keep some things close

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,759
to the vest in terms of development uh

259
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,640
like it or not one has to have

260
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,039
intellectual property attached to be

261
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,039
able to continue the work

262
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:10,159
as it is now

263
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:13,519
we have found ourselves at credo science

264
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,360
going uh into a few tangents to try and

265
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,000
support the operation

266
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,720
but we've got a lot of proverbial irons

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,720
in the fire

268
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,320
but the chance to network

269
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,800
again is fundamental here to see with

270
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,440
whom you want to collaborate on whatever

271
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,519
level who's got the novel extraction

272
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
technique that might be ideally suited

273
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,200
to the medicine that you're trying to

274
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,320
develop right um

275
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,720
seeing what the markets are

276
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,640
it's always a matter of what what are

277
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,360
other people doing

278
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:52,000
how can we either work with them or

279
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,320
maybe it generates a new idea we can

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,240
take in a different direction

281
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,640
so again it's that intellectual

282
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,440
interchange that's just fundamental to

283
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,078
how

284
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,519
science advances yeah no and that's one

285
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,359
of the things we've noticed in the last

286
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,919
few years there being more sort of

287
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,919
announcements of novel technologies or

288
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,199
novel methods that that go on at the

289
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,399
event so

290
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,519
we like to think that's the strength of

291
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,639
the event

292
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,078
hopefully

293
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,759
all right ethan well thanks again for

294
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,519
taking the time hope you enjoyed your

295
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,200
time in the cam ed coffee talk lounge

296
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,320
and look forward to having a great event

297
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,320
with you a pleasure thank you

298
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,039
you
