1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,179
thank everybody for joining us sorry for

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,769
the delay my name is jeff chen i'm the

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,779
director of the UCLA cannabis research

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,118
initiative really excited to be here and

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:21,149
host canta med here at UCLA i actually

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:24,420
earned my medical degree and my MBA both

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,368
here at UCLA so I'm a Bruin any Bruins

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,850
in the audience yeah we got a bunch

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,469
right okay and just a quick 30 second

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,198
blur about what is the UCLA cannabis

11
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:35,579
research initiative so we started the

12
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:37,349
program about a year ago and it was

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,338
through a generous gift from Terry and

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,408
Jane Cemil and our mission is to advance

15
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:46,920
the scientific understanding of the

16
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:50,969
impacts of cannabis on body brain mind

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,408
and society and so we have 37 faculty

18
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,298
members from UCLA who've joined the

19
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:55,829
initiative it spans over 15 different

20
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:57,920
departments in six different schools

21
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,298
here at UCLA so it's an incredibly

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,670
collaborative multidisciplinary effort

23
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:08,129
and today we're here to talk about

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:11,490
Alzheimer's disease and by 2050 it is

25
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:14,039
estimated that one in two seniors when

26
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:18,328
they pass will suffer from some form of

27
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:19,950
dementia one and two and Alzheimer's

28
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,718
disease is the most common form of

29
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,950
dementia and that's why we're here to

30
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:26,339
talk about this so I'd like to introduce

31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,679
our panelists so to my right here we

32

have dr. Jamie Cox he's the chief

33
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:33,379
medical officer of sundial growers which

34
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,399
is a cannabis producer in Alberta Canada

35
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:38,009
dr. Cox works with healthcare

36
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,450
organizations universities and industry

37
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,608
partners to help them understand

38
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,310
cannabis as a viable medical treatment

39
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:46,709
he has over two decades of senior

40
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,719
healthcare leadership roles including a

41
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:52,349
stint including his role as medical

42
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,568
director of General Motors to my right I

43
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,699
also have dr. Gary smalls he's a

44
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,350
professor of psychiatry at the UCLA

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,450
Semel Institute for Neuroscience and

46
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,099
human behavior he's also the director of

47
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,829
the UC a longevity Center and the

48
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,780
director of geriatric psychiatry he's

49
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:08,728
developed brain imaging technology that

50
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,649
can detect Alzheimer's years before

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,569
symptoms start he's also tested

52
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,729
medications that can delay the onset of

53
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:17,068
Alzheimer's and he's developed healthy

54
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:18,840
aging lifestyle and memory programs that

55
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:21,810
are widely used throughout the

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,759
les Scientific American magazine named

57
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,830
him the world's top 50 innovators in

58
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,019
science and technology and he's written

59
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,420
the New York Times best-selling book the

60
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:33,209
memory Bible and finally at the end of

61
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,889
the table we have dr. David Schubert he

62
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,299
is a professor and co-founder of the

63
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,309
neuroscience program at the Salk

64
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,439
Institute he established the first

65
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,299
additional chemistry lab at the Salk

66
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,889
Institute and his recent work has

67
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,750
focused on developing treatments for

68
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:48,238
neurodegenerative disorders including

69
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,280
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's he has

70
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,890
developed synthetic derivatives of

71
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,840
naturally synthetic derivatives of

72
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:57,259
natural plant compounds that have much

73
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,329
improved properties over their natural

74
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:03,209
analogs and he's starting phase one

75
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:06,060
human studies for one of his drugs j14 7

76
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,759
for Alzheimer's disease he has also been

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,340
conducting drug screening on various

78
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,780
cannabinoid compounds to elucidate their

79
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,878
neuroprotective properties in

80
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,318
Alzheimer's disease so please join me in

81
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,318
a warm welcome for our panelists today

82
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:25,229
and so I think the first question to

83
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,480
start off with is maybe let's talk about

84
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,849
the current state of evidence and state

85
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,769
of treatments for Alzheimer's in terms

86
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,000
of actually the progression of the

87
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,530
disease what what treatments are

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,120
available right now what are the

89
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,419
benefits what are the side effects that

90
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,629
we're looking at well I can start with

91
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,149
that we we have several medicines that

92
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:47,549
are called symptomatic treatments which

93
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,560
means they help temporarily with the

94
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,739
symptoms they don't cure the disease

95
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,780
they don't stop its progression and

96
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:58,140
they've been around for several decades

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,150
so they're already directly marketed to

98
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,779
consumers you've probably seen ads about

99
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,030
them on television and we use them

100
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,849
routinely when patients have mild

101
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,310
moderate or severe Alzheimer's or other

102
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:14,729
forms of dementia there's been a lot of

103
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:17,608
drug development and other treatment

104
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:20,370
development in trying to come up with

105
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:23,370
what's often termed a disease modifying

106
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,590
treatment so that would mean that this

107
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,050
treatment would actually get into the

108
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:32,039
brain and have an impact on either

109
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,560
stopping the disease or slowing it one

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,050
way to think about symptomatic versus

111
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,509
disease-modifying if you had pneumonia

112
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,759
you would take aspirin as a symptomatic

113
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,339
treatment but you'd have to take an

114
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,269
antibiotic as a disease modifying

115
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:50,579
treatment unfortunately more than 99% of

116
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:51,870
the disease modifying treatments have

117
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:55,439
failed there actually

118
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:58,259
all of them have failed thus far so you

119
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,478
know we're all looking for better

120
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,509
approaches to try to deal with this

121
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,469
devastating illness yeah I'd like to

122
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,620
comment on that

123
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,650
certainly yesterday it was well

124
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,139
demonstrated by the at the CME session

125
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:17,219
the neural protective benefits of the

126
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,199
various cannabinoids and for us not to

127
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,020
start looking at that seriously I

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,449
believe as a group the service to

129
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:26,639
protential e half y'all in the audience

130
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,219
okay because one and two of us are gonna

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,469
get it so it's up to us to start making

132
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,159
a difference you know the the old saying

133
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,300
keep doing what you've

134
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:36,399
you're gonna keep getting what you've

135
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,179
got it's time for us to make a change

136
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,889
so I'm full on to the looking at the

137
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:46,408
camera noise in them in the proper

138
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:50,168
perspective because like dr. small said

139
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:53,110
99.9 percent failure rate it's not very

140
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:57,038
good I wouldn't say so let's try doing

141
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,479
something slightly different and maybe

142
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,579
on that note you mentioned disease

143
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,348
modifying agents what are some of the

144
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,300
currently used disease modifying agents

145
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:07,240
how effective are they what are the

146
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,249
potential downsides well for Alzheimer's

147
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,528
disease there are no disease modifying

148
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:13,719
agents that are being used there are

149
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:16,240
several that are being studied and

150
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:19,360
tested most of them there's quite a few

151
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,478
in development right now most of them

152
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,939
have focused on trying trying to clear

153
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,848
out the amyloid plaques that build up in

154
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:31,479
the brain alois alzheimer defined the

155
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:34,658
disease in 1906 when he did a brain

156
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,699
autopsy study on a middle-aged woman who

157
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:38,769
had the clinical symptoms and he

158
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,679
revealed to the medical community for

159
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:44,528
the first time abnormal protein deposits

160
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:46,658
called neurofibrillary tangles and

161
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:48,459
amyloid plaques that collect in the

162
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:51,938
centers of the brain that control

163
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:54,369
thinking and memory so a lot of the drug

164
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:57,729
development has been to try to clear out

165
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:59,679
those plaques that hasn't worked at this

166
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:02,110
point they're trying to use those

167
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:03,908
treatments earlier in the course of the

168
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,889
disease so they'll look for families

169
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:07,868
where there's a genetic mutation and

170
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,028
treat people who they know are going to

171
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:12,729
get the disease as a result of the

172
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:14,558
mutation to try to prevent the disease

173
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:16,899
and I think that's progress and a lot of

174
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:19,959
the research we're doing is trying to

175
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:23,949
target people before they have dementia

176
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:26,439
this is a very slow insidious gradually

177
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:29,740
progressive condition that our studies

178
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:31,990
and other studies have shown that the

179
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,059
these abnormal protein deposits actually

180
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,478
collect in the brain decades before

181
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:39,309
people have symptoms so I'm a big fan of

182
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,008
trying to protect a healthy brain rather

183
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:45,129
than trying to repair damage once it's

184
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:46,210
extensive and and dr. Schubert what are

185
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,610
some of the MEC

186
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:51,339
in isms through which cannabinoids might

187
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,189
be able to have therapeutic potential

188
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:56,049
for some of the actual disease

189
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:57,728
progression of in Alzheimer's well I

190
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,439
think that's a tough question but I just

191
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:02,430
sort of like go back a step because I'm

192
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,750
a big fan of plants and we do have

193
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,250
synthetic drugs which we're trying to

194
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,079
get into clinic and some of these are

195
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,168
pretty well long at least in the

196
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:15,129
preclinical stage and so if you look at

197
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:17,228
the history of you know drug development

198
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:19,449
the majority of the drugs in the clinic

199
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:22,569
today are based on plants I mean this

200
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:24,430
chemical scaffolds are basically those

201
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,219
from chemicals that derived from plants

202
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:30,280
so the problem with Alzheimer's is we

203
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,070
realize a long time ago or so maybe ten

204
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,228
years ago is that this amyloid idea is

205
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,610
was a very good idea to begin with and

206
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,080
where you hear accumulate the plaques

207
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,918
and the tangles and whatever the initial

208
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,040
description but that may not be the only

209
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:47,199
thing that's going on so so we took an

210
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,240
approach that we did some library

211
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,290
screening of big collection of plant

212
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,110
extracts and found some compounds that

213
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:59,139
worked quite well and these we developed

214
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,720
a series of essays which mimic the old

215
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:03,730
brain what happens in the aging brain

216
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,800
and then we screen compounds and trying

217
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,250
to find ones that work and then modify

218
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:12,159
those so that they could make a better

219
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:16,480
pharmaceutical the appropriate drug and

220
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:19,149
so the question is in the cannabinoid

221
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,379
field how you would go about doing that

222
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,850
and I think the plant itself as you've

223
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,740
heard this morning has a lot of

224
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,579
attributes and probably a lot of things

225
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,110
are going on in what when you are

226
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:33,609
exposed to this plant that you really

227
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,209
don't understand as far as the

228
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,028
therapeutic potential so so I think if

229
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:42,819
you want to talk about specific targets

230
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:44,528
I think that may be something of a

231
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,360
mistake because I don't think you know

232
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:48,759
what this target should be for

233
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,190
Alzheimer's disease and you have a

234
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:55,990
couple ideas obviously the cannabinoid

235
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:58,209
receptors are widely studied but there's

236
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,129
obviously some problems looking at

237
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:02,879
directly at those

238
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:05,909
so the idea has been to sort of take

239
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,039
away take apart the plant and look at

240
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:10,110
their 500 so unique chemicals in the

241
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:15,209
plant and screen those and assays which

242
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:18,840
we have used to to identify potential

243
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:23,370
therapeutics and that's that's what

244
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:25,230
we're going to do hopefully and but you

245
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,590
know I think it's probably not a good

246
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,200
idea to try to pre-select a target for

247
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,660
this particular disease because you're

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,990
looking at genetic based targets and

249
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:39,269
looking at pre selected targets that

250
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,039
sort of implies you know more about the

251
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,389
disease and what you really do so

252
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,929
particularly with a lot of these

253
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:47,759
neurodegenerative diseases this pre

254
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:50,609
selected target idea is probably not

255
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,620
good so we like to do sort of screening

256
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,440
assays without knowing their target and

257
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,639
trying to find drugs at work and and can

258
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,730
you clarify when you're talking about

259
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,500
target are you referring to a target

260
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,420
drug to study are you referring to a

261
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,360
target receptor in the body that you

262
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,069
want to design a drug around usually

263
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,009
when you're talking about drugs you're

264
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,870
talking about a molecular target and so

265
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:16,860
that means one molecule the drug

266
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:18,330
interacts with and what if you what what

267
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,870
have you discovered as to the properties

268
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,520
in of any cannabis derived compounds

269
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,960
that you've done in your lab that might

270
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,779
be relevant to neurodegenerative

271
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,660
diseases well what's unique about our

272
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:33,389
lab I think is the screening assays we

273
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:35,069
use to pick up these activities and and

274
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:37,830
they're based on as I said they're

275
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:41,010
basing on aging things that happened in

276
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,870
older brains so so age is the biggest

277
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,000
risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and

278
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,009
people have known that for a little I

279
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,529
mean the last hundred years of it but

280
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:52,590
people the drug discovery world has not

281
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:55,919
really paid much attention to that and

282
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:58,230
so I think that's a big mistake so so if

283
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,779
you look at the cannabinoids in the

284
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,870
context of what we've learned from our

285
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,579
own work I think there's a number of

286
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,600
pathways which are affected in the

287
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:12,110
answer inflammation is a major component

288
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:16,220
most neurodegenerative diseases systemic

289
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:19,959
information contributes to that there is

290
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,610
something which is sort of hidden in the

291
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:24,109
literature but it's it's appreciating

292
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:28,789
the aging field as this mTOR pathway

293
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:32,028
which is an anti-aging pathway and we

294
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:34,068
were just we found that our drugs affect

295
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:35,990
this very much like these anti-aging

296
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:40,099
compounds is sort so called Jarrow

297
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,259
protectors and so the cannabinoids

298
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,990
actually influence this pathway in a

299
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:47,329
pretty profound way so I think that

300
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,149
could be a target pathway but there's no

301
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:53,508
really serious studies in the way of

302
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:55,639
neuro degeneration in this pathway this

303
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:56,600
target particularly so you mentioned

304
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,448
inflammation

305
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,190
you mentioned the mTOR pathway there was

306
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:03,559
also some work that your lab had done I

307
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:08,149
believe with THC and amyloid buildup

308
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:11,379
could you speak briefly on that so one

309
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:13,519
of our drugs which were should start

310
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:19,419
clinical trial approval next week

311
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:23,149
actually the it works in part by

312
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:25,099
activating one of the cb1 pathway and I

313
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:28,159
think this is an indirect activation of

314
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,920
this pathway so so we know that these

315
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,838
drugs clear out this ham Lloyd which

316
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:35,240
accumulates inside neurons and very

317
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,569
early stages of Alzheimer's disease and

318
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:43,039
we've looked at like 10 non psychoactive

319
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:46,578
components of the cannabis and they also

320
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:52,639
do very much the same thing CBD CBD CBN

321
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:54,849
and one potential explanation of this

322
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,100
these are anti-inflammatory there

323
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,839
antioxidants and some respect and so we

324
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,360
think that this there's a structural

325
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,130
we've been looking at the chemistry of

326
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,688
these molecules because we do medicinal

327
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:07,938
chemistry and we're trying to figure out

328
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:10,188
if there's some structural motif which

329
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:14,629
probably identifies a different type of

330
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:17,208
receptor and brain tissue that it can be

331
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:19,818
engaged by these molecules and they're

332
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:23,119
clearly not working exclusively through

333
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:25,338
the cb1 cb2

334
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,860
because we have a one of our screening

335
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,540
of assays uses cell a nerve cell line

336
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,250
that doesn't have these receptors so

337
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:33,199
there's something else going on we're

338
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,120
just trying to figure that out thank you

339
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,610
and so we've been talking a lot about

340
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,769
the underlying mechanisms that cause

341
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,480
Alzheimer's we just touched on some of

342
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:43,759
the underlying mechanisms through which

343
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,009
cannabinoids may have some therapeutic

344
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,929
potential let's shift gears a little bit

345
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:49,639
and maybe talked about and you touch on

346
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:53,500
this very briefly dr. smalls is the

347
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:56,360
symptoms of Alzheimer's and I think

348
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,580
anecdotally there are folks who are

349
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,409
using cannabis to manage the symptoms of

350
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,759
Alzheimer's and is there any grounding

351
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:03,049
and science for that what are the what

352
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,458
does the literature say maybe let's

353
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:06,349
start with talking about what are some

354
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,909
of those symptoms of Alzheimer's and how

355
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,589
do we treat some of those symptoms right

356
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:16,028
now so early on when Alzheimer's strikes

357
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:19,459
people generally develop memory issues

358
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:22,338
but they also can experience mood

359
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:25,369
changes and behavioral changes social

360
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:28,010
withdrawal anxiety depression a months

361
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:31,490
or even years before the diagnosis is

362
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:34,069
made so there can be quite diverse

363
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,399
mental symptoms that present although

364
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,250
memory short-term memory seems to be the

365
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:44,750
biggest complaint as the condition

366
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:47,950
progresses there are there's worsening

367
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:51,440
of the memory problems there's confusion

368
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:53,890
there are language difficulties there's

369
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,290
problems of course with paying attention

370
00:15:53,889 --> 00:16:02,149
their personality changes there are

371
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:04,429
visual spatial problems so pretty much

372
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:07,909
all areas of cognitive functioning are

373
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:10,699
affected and as you get further and

374
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:12,439
further into the disease there is more

375
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,110
and more emergence of behavioral

376
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:19,130
symptoms aggression psychotic symptoms

377
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:22,100
paranoia and it can be quite difficult

378
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:25,370
for caregivers to manage that the

379
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,220
treatments are generally the symptomatic

380
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:31,929
medicines that I mentioned before

381
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:35,620
medicines like to nepo sill rivastigmine

382
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:39,039
and memantine that are used to help with

383
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,379
these symptoms and we also try to

384
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:44,189
counsel families on dealing with the the

385
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:47,259
difficult behaviors along the way

386
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:49,960
another approach that we've championed

387
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:52,269
and others have gotten behind this is to

388
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,670
try to help people with their everyday

389
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:57,299
lifestyle there's there's been a lot of

390
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:59,799
compelling research showing that

391
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:02,889
genetics don't account for all the risk

392
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,930
factors for developing dementia

393
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:08,500
certainly age is the greatest single

394
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:10,230
risk factors that was just mentioned but

395
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,130
people who are physically inactive

396
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:18,150
people who don't get adequate sleep

397
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:21,130
individuals who are obese and midlife

398
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,620
people who don't eat a healthy diet who

399
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,480
are stressed out chronically these are

400
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,188
all risk factors for developing

401
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:32,140
cognitive decline and we try to help

402
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:35,890
people with that as well and just to add

403
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,429
another reality-based issue that a lot

404
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,929
of the senior population have especially

405
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:44,470
those afflicted with early onset

406
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:46,600
Alzheimer's is the polypharmacy

407
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,900
that we see bereft in the older

408
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:51,789
population one of my prior roles was a

409
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,179
medical director at a large extended

410
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:57,549
care facility and the number of

411
00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:01,450
off-label drugs that are used in the

412
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:05,678
older population is really overtly

413
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:08,559
concerning to me too we're already

414
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,870
dealing with the brain disease as dr.

415
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,000
small has elucidated with with the

416
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:16,000
inflammation which leads to the

417
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,549
Alzheimer's add on top of that atypical

418
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,950
antipsychotics benzodiazepines

419
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:26,710
neuroleptic medications and then try to

420
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,539
function knowing that you've also got

421
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:32,309
this coexisting condition that's

422
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:34,990
creeping up and beers report is really

423
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:37,899
underutilized in the senior population

424
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,880
in my opinion and if we had a clear

425
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,679
focus on the pharmaceuticals that are

426
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,270
being used in this population and

427
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,030
started weaning these ineffective

428
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:46,379
medications off

429
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:49,200
it would give us a much greater

430
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,110
opportunity to actually impact people's

431
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,390
lives which is what we as physicians are

432
00:18:52,109 --> 00:19:00,750
responsible to do improve quality of

433
00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:03,600
life do no harm so if I can just expand

434
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,930
on that a bit more another common

435
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,969
problem is people take over-the-counter

436
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,890
medicines for sleep or they take

437
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,620
antihistamines that have an

438
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,920
anticholinergic effect now that's

439
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:19,079
important because one of the

440
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,490
neurotransmitter systems that gets into

441
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,730
trouble in Alzheimer's is the

442
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,700
cholinergic system so that will in fact

443
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,710
several the drugs that are have been

444
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,870
developed and used for Alzheimer's are

445
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,420
cholinergic drugs so that's a problem

446
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:36,359
and as as I mentioned some of the

447
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,840
behavioral problems that emerge later in

448
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:42,779
the disease which which generally lead

449
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:44,629
caregivers to to get their family

450
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:48,809
members into nursing homes and

451
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:50,910
institutionalized facilities we don't

452
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:52,679
have great treatments for that we have

453
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,180
these antipsychotic drugs there are

454
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,769
black box warnings and there are

455
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,049
problems with that sometimes you use

456
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,970
antidepressants so there's a lot of

457
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:02,099
research going on right now looking for

458
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:08,029
medicines that might calm people down

459
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:08,029
now there have been some studies using

460
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:13,919
marijuana products to treat that and the

461
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:16,079
results are a bit mixed sometimes they

462
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,470
cause side effects sometimes they seem

463
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:21,119
to calm patients down and what are some

464
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,460
of that you mentioned black box warnings

465
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,809
for some of these medicines and kind of

466
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,039
described ions what what that is and

467
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:29,450
what are some of the risks associated

468
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:31,639
with these medicines so there are

469
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:34,799
antipsychotics typical and atypical

470
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,210
antipsychotics that can increase the

471
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:41,009
risk of a stroke or increase the risk of

472
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,960
diabetes and so there's been a lot of

473
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:44,629
concern about that so doctors try to

474
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,819
even though they can be quite effective

475
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:50,730
when patients are psychotic and

476
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:53,099
aggressive we're concerned about the

477
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,559
side effects from that and the other

478
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:58,278
issue with that is the use of atypical

479
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:01,249
antipsychotics in this population

480
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:04,159
is not meant to be chronic use of the

481
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:06,229
pharmaceutical if it's if there's

482
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,778
aggressive behavior or psychotic

483
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:10,609
behavior it's supposed to be used at

484
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:11,528
that time and then it's supposed to be

485
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:14,749
weaned off

486
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:18,200
unfortunately I've seen about 60% of

487
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:22,190
some senior populations in extended care

488
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,379
they're on atypical antipsychotics until

489
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,269
that they're done watching there's no

490
00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:27,978
drug right now that's been approve to

491
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:30,588
treat the psychosis associated with

492
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:31,969
dementia there are several compounds

493
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:35,229
that are in development that might

494
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:38,599
succeed but we have nothing right now

495
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:41,179
and in terms of you mentioned some of

496
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:43,189
these clinical trials of cannabis or THC

497
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:45,649
and that sometimes they were associated

498
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,719
with side effects what are some of the

499
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:50,329
biggest concerns and risks for the use

500
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:53,869
of cannabis or Camden cannabis products

501
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:56,449
in Alzheimer's patients well you know if

502
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:59,418
you if patients get overly sedated they

503
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:02,239
can fall and hurt themselves and we know

504
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:04,570
that with dementia people often have

505
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:07,219
unsteady gait so that could be

506
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:11,269
compounded they will become more

507
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:15,109
withdrawn which is a problem when a big

508
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:17,358
issue I see is people widowed

509
00:22:15,108 --> 00:22:19,428
individuals living alone at home and

510
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:22,509
they're completely isolated so they

511
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:24,798
can't deal with their daily activities

512
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:28,219
they're not always safe in the house

513
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:30,769
they can wander off and if they're using

514
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:34,969
cannabis could make those symptoms even

515
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:37,399
worse yeah and that's why the need for

516
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:39,499
studies there we're going to be

517
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:44,298
embarking we're fortunate enough in

518
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:47,118
Canada I am from Canada a so the we are

519
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:50,538
fortunate enough in some provinces to

520
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:53,058
have policy on use of cannabinoids in

521
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:56,440
extended care so we're actually going to

522
00:22:53,058 --> 00:23:00,678
be embarking on a formalized trial not

523
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,469
using high THC but rather a higher CBD

524
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,639
which has a more satisfactory

525
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:06,619
side-effect profile in the elderly

526
00:23:04,638 --> 00:23:09,588
population to see if we can truly impact

527
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:11,539
the anxiety and aggression that can be

528
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:14,210
seen in this population

529
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:17,089
and and so it's maybe speaking to that

530
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:20,269
because medical cannabis has been more

531
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:21,740
widely used and regulated in Canada what

532
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:24,950
is the current state you mentioned

533
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:27,859
there's certain extended care facilities

534
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,940
that have lenient cannabis policies what

535
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:31,159
does that landscape look like right now

536
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,850
for the use in extended care or memory

537
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,650
care facilities it's it's really

538
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:40,730
evolutionary to be quite honest with you

539
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:44,240
um the the policy in the province of

540
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:48,019
Saskatchewan was guidance policy on the

541
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,150
use of cannabinoids typically cannabis

542
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:52,549
is not used in extended care facilities

543
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,220
in Canada it's still considered to be a

544
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:57,319
locked drug the same thing as a narcotic

545
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,690
so it has to go through significant

546
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:02,149
protocols to be even able to be used

547
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:05,509
I'll say on the floor by the nursing

548
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:07,790
staff to dispense it that's why we're

549
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:09,559
focusing on Saskatchewan first because

550
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:11,899
they've already got an accepted policy

551
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:15,049
and the goal is certainly in no way

552
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,330
shape or form to create any sense of an

553
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:19,419
individual being stoned it's about

554
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:22,789
trying to improve their quality of life

555
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:25,759
the ideal scenario would be to see some

556
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:27,529
people wake up again you know from the

557
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,500
polypharmacy it's it's brief though

558
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:32,000
there folks I tell you and so we've been

559
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,650
talking a bit about the symptomatic

560
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,150
management I'd like to almost bring the

561
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,100
conversation back to some of the

562
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,930
underlying mechanisms that might target

563
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:40,159
the disease and dr. Schubert one

564
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,920
question I had for you is you mentioned

565
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,320
how you traditionally you take naturally

566
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,190
natural compounds and then you develop

567
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,079
analogs

568
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,630
so things that look similar but you

569
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,879
modify them slightly to improve various

570
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,170
attributes of them and what did what are

571
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,940
your thoughts as to where you want to go

572
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,440
with your cannabinoid work you've

573
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,640
mentioned these various phyto

574
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,130
cannabinoids you've been working with

575
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,690
well I can first offer these should

576
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:06,200
define the problem because the problem

577
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:08,210
is we've initially was 10 15 years ago

578
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,460
started working with natural products

579
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,769
and tried to use these in therapeutic

580
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,600
you know contacts of helping with

581
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:16,279
Alzheimer's Parkinson's these types of

582
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:18,799
Z's but the problem with natural

583
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:20,389
products is it's basically from a

584
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,279
pharmaceutical point of view they're

585
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,009
dead end because nobody is going to

586
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,410
support a clinical trial for something

587
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:30,109
down to Walmart or someplace and buy and

588
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:32,360
so we worked for many years and we have

589
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:34,399
natural products which we think and

590
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:35,990
other people like people like great coal

591
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,690
here has been working on curcumin at

592
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,970
UCLA for years and it's just extremely

593
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,190
difficult to get a natural product into

594
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,410
a clinical trial and people in the

595
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,450
cannabinoid field are going to you know

596
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,740
there are ways to get around that but

597
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:51,110
you know the clinical trials for

598
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:54,049
Alzheimer's are extremely expensive and

599
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:55,729
difficult and so it's somebody has to

600
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:57,950
make money out the way their government

601
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,829
the United States or the world set up in

602
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,110
order to give something into the clinic

603
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:05,059
so our the only way we could get the

604
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:07,339
compounds that we were really thought

605
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:10,220
we're helpful into the clinic was by

606
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:12,169
making synthetic patentable duties of

607
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,579
that and then even with that in the

608
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:18,320
Alzheimer's field has been very

609
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:20,299
difficult to to to you know get funding

610
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,849
for their clinical trials and for the

611
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:24,139
preclinical development so that may

612
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,789
change there's more money in the

613
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,690
Alzheimer's field now than there was a

614
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:32,210
couple of years ago so but the rationale

615
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:34,549
for doing the clinical medicinal

616
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,250
chemistry is to make the drug more

617
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:39,379
potent and more bioavailable and their

618
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,910
problems with natural products in the

619
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,950
sense there are some chemical issues

620
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:47,150
that that medicinal chemists don't like

621
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:50,720
and so you you we felt in order to

622
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:52,430
survive as a lab and you know try to

623
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,160
move things towards the clinic we just

624
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:58,310
had to do the medicinal chemistry to get

625
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,080
things moving and I think there are

626
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:02,450
going to be issues in the cannabinoid

627
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,419
field of the same problem it maybe you

628
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,769
can organize it and learn from what's

629
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,769
people in the past working on natural

630
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:15,559
products I've learned but it's going to

631
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:19,849
be I think a little bit difficult so you

632
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:22,730
mentioned curcumin and you know we just

633
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:26,869
published a study using a bioavailable

634
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:31,400
form of curcumin that's manufactured by

635
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:34,879
a Japanese company and we studied people

636
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,160
not with dementia but people at risk for

637
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,340
dementia so they had what's coughing

638
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:43,288
called mild cognitive

639
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:47,490
or even just normal aging and we studied

640
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:51,839
them for 18 months and we compared the

641
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:54,150
compound to placebo and curcumin is a

642
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,668
component of tumeric so it's basically a

643
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,220
spice that's been around for thousands

644
00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:01,740
of years and it reminds me a bit about

645
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,278
of cannabis because it ticks all the

646
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:08,159
boxes in terms of effects it's

647
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:12,659
anti-inflammatory its antioxidant anti

648
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:15,179
and so forth but we had even though it

649
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:17,970
was a relatively small study it had a

650
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:20,038
fairly robust effect on memory and

651
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,890
attention and so we're gonna be

652
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:25,740
following that up with a larger study to

653
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:30,390
confirm the results but I think this

654
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:32,759
offers a model for testing cannabis

655
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:36,990
products that have the right balance of

656
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:39,179
ingredients so you don't have the mental

657
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,909
effects that might be problematic but

658
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:45,298
you have the effects on inflammation and

659
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:47,940
oxidation and even possibly amyloid

660
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:51,089
buildup and you test it in people not

661
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:54,298
with dementia but people who are at risk

662
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:55,889
for it earlier in the stage of their

663
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:59,009
neuro degeneration

664
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,750
I think you can go back a little bit

665
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:03,148
even further than that so there's this

666
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,490
concept which has been around for a

667
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:08,819
hundred years and recently been sort of

668
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,890
revamped by the aging Institute NIH and

669
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:12,569
the buck Institute up in Northern

670
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,990
California's idea is something called

671
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:20,038
zero protectors and zero protectors are

672
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,870
the idea is if you can define compounds

673
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,298
which maybe extend life and model

674
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:27,000
organisms in index Inlet and the

675
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,950
extrapolate that to humans and if you

676
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,898
extend lifespan to a little bit you'll

677
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:37,080
and you'll you'll forestall the advent

678
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:40,648
of these age associated diseases like

679
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:42,658
Alzheimer's and Parkinson and so it

680
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:44,729
turns out we we've looked at a lot of

681
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:46,740
the pathways involved I look like with

682
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,130
curcumin and our drugs which heard Rodya

683
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,910
curcumin

684
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:54,430
and other sort of known dural protectors

685
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:58,480
for example like alcohol restriction is

686
00:29:54,430 --> 00:30:02,880
a you know it's obvious what that is and

687
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:06,779
others two others are metformin which is

688
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,210
anti-diabetic drug it has other problem

689
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:13,539
uses too then rapamycin and so it turns

690
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:15,490
out that all these drugs have are these

691
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:18,430
compounds in caloric restriction have

692
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:22,870
the same molecular pathways which lead

693
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:25,930
in model organisms to life extension and

694
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:29,250
so when I just went this weekend I was

695
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:31,960
looking at what's happening in this CBD

696
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:33,670
sea-tac field and it turns out these

697
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,420
compounds they were affecting oh they

698
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:41,350
sent same pathways as curcumin and some

699
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:43,660
of the flavonoids and our curcumin

700
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:47,349
derivative so I think there's this

701
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:51,210
opportunity for for the cannabinoid

702
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:54,069
field is since these drugs are mostly

703
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:57,789
cannabinoids are anti-inflammatory is

704
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:59,529
sort of even before you have like mild

705
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:02,529
cognitive impairment or whatever and the

706
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:05,980
Alzheimer's world you know there's some

707
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:07,930
long-term dural protector I mean this

708
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,759
really hasn't been looked at as far as I

709
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:13,180
know in the cannabinoid field but I

710
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,799
think this is a potential no use for it

711
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,630
you know I think eventually that may be

712
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,509
the case one of the challenges though

713
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,370
and doing human studies if you start

714
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:24,099
very early and very young people you

715
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:27,069
might be able to have a signal on a

716
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:30,730
biomarker but to see a clinical signal

717
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:32,379
is very difficult and it isn't until you

718
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,360
get people with what we call normal

719
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,460
aging which be it would be the precursor

720
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,619
to MCI or mild cognitive impairment

721
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:42,029
which would be the precursor to dementia

722
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:44,229
in normal aging you you are able to see

723
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:46,420
neuropsychological tests that are quite

724
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:49,480
sensitive and you can see changes when

725
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:52,090
you test compounds like curcumin but

726
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,870
metformin there is a large study right

727
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:55,869
now look

728
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:58,389
and lots of aging targets and I think

729
00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:00,369
that makes sense but let me also add

730
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:04,450
another point when you talk about going

731
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:07,479
in earlier we and others have studied

732
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:11,140
what the brain looks like late in life

733
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:14,079
in people who are heavy marijuana users

734
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:17,400
early in life and it's not a pretty

735
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:20,288
picture it turns out that you have

736
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,720
atrophy or shrinkage of the medial

737
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:28,509
temporal cortex which is an important

738
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:30,788
area of memory consolidation so you know

739
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:34,629
when we talk about any kind of

740
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:37,450
medication or or plant or supplement

741
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,880
whatever it is it's really you got to

742
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,700
take timing into consideration and

743
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,789
dosage and the contents of the compound

744
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:49,140
to optimize the therapeutic effects and

745
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:51,569
minimize any adverse effects

746
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,100
thank you about the great point about

747
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:56,168
potential confounding factors as to

748
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:57,609
timing and onset right there's a lot of

749
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:00,788
concern about the use of cannabis with

750
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:03,519
the developing brain one area that I had

751
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:06,250
a question on is there's been some work

752
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,319
on the aged breath this is an animal

753
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,690
studies that on the aged brain and the

754
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,849
impacts of THC on memory and even

755
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:21,190
neurogenesis on the aged brain no no if

756
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:25,418
there if any guys I've heard very

757
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:28,899
anecdotal commentary on that and I guess

758
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:30,610
- we're in a unique position in Canada

759
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:34,509
I'm gonna go a little bit tangent but

760
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:40,990
I'll come back to it cannabis is

761
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:43,569
legalized in Canada so it is so the

762
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:48,519
choice of whether to use cannabis or not

763
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:51,398
is now left in to the individual we as

764
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,710
individuals in the space of having the

765
00:33:51,398 --> 00:34:00,808
ability to do some research to share our

766
00:33:53,710 --> 00:34:04,090
knowledge and anecdotal is a funny word

767
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:06,319
dr. Russo yesterday showed a slide for

768
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:10,190
those who weren't there was fibromyalgia

769
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:12,559
and it was 1,400 people self-reporting

770
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,619
how they were doing on traditional

771
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:19,130
pharmaceuticals which were clinically

772
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:21,739
approved randomized trials but they

773
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:25,099
weren't doing very good these people

774
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:28,099
were using cannabis to treat their

775
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:31,219
symptoms and they found it's superior to

776
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:34,219
traditional pharmaceuticals that's going

777
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:36,049
to happen in Canada as well so for us to

778
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:38,629
be able to look at it a little bit

779
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,429
different and look at in Canada we've

780
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,019
got the a reality like I said it's legal

781
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:44,059
so let's make sure that we have

782
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:46,519
information that we can provide to our

783
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:48,279
aging population North America we're all

784
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:51,349
getting older we're not getting younger

785
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,500
so if we focus more on a holistic

786
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:56,989
approach and actually identify an

787
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:00,170
outcome based on how an individual is

788
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:04,159
doing I think that may be a slightly

789
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:05,690
different slant on the research the the

790
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:09,109
horse is already out of the barn in

791
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:11,150
Canada to be able to take a long multi

792
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,559
million dollar research funded grant

793
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,690
that's going to take five years to

794
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,789
demonstrate that level of outcome I

795
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,960
don't think it's going to happen to two

796
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:21,710
doctor Schubert's point is very

797
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:26,630
expensive to do a lot of research in the

798
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:29,119
lab where by only 5% of any research in

799
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:32,210
the lab is ever commercialized it stays

800
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,609
in the lab so we have to be nimble in

801
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:37,880
this new environment and perhaps think a

802
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:39,980
little bit differently one so just to

803
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,619
reiterate I think what dr. Cox is saying

804
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,269
is that the the opportunity to almost

805
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:45,859
reverse translate findings so

806
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:48,170
translation is where you go from animal

807
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,400
studies to human studies here we have an

808
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,349
opportunity to reverse translate

809
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,119
findings where we learn from the

810
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:55,339
anecdotal evidence we don't take it for

811
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,559
face value but based on that we try

812
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,000
maybe engineer the animal studies or the

813
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,739
clinical trials we know what right

814
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,599
questions to ask to actually test

815
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:04,129
whether or not this is a real effect

816
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,150
yeah and I think it's important to

817
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:10,670
really demonstrate effective analytics

818
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:13,430
of data when you're looking at thousands

819
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:17,300
of people with all variables not

820
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:19,639
controlled but like everyone in the room

821
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,830
we're all different physiologically

822
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:25,099
the unique thing and I've seen 3,000

823
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:27,590
patients for referral from for cannabis

824
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:30,079
use for primary care and specialist is

825
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:31,640
it's interesting that everyone uses the

826
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,529
same mantra when we're talking about

827
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:38,299
treatment with cannabis go slow and

828
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,950
gradually up titrate to effective dose

829
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,289
when you're looking at some of the

830
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:44,449
pharmaceuticals on that are currently

831
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:47,420
available there's no ability to micro

832
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:49,189
titrate if you got a capsule that's 300

833
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:54,170
milligrams guess what you're going to

834
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:56,389
get 300 milligrams so it's the education

835
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,059
gap that we have within the physician

836
00:36:56,389 --> 00:37:01,549
community needs to be narrowed but we

837
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:05,690
have an opportunity ask clinicians to do

838
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:09,670
it correctly and with our remaining time

839
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,670
I'd like to open it up for questions

840
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,809
thank you I'd like to shed a little

841
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,970
light on this from a physician

842
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:21,980
standpoint in Northern California where

843
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:25,219
we're using residential care facilities

844
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:29,000
for the elderly as a place for cannabis

845
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:32,480
use in in dementia care there are more

846
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,960
than one regularly using cannabis on a

847
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,940
two three time day daily basis we

848
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,550
usually start at about 10 milligrams of

849
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,950
THC and 10 milligrams of CBD per dose

850
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:45,019
we'll go down sometimes but usually

851
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:47,869
that's a starting dose it'll knock

852
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:50,000
elderly demented patients down for a

853
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:52,489
couple days and then they get up and

854
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,400
behave much differently with a marked

855
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:57,319
reduction in their agitated behaviors we

856
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,780
can use the Cowan Mansfield agitation

857
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,550
index as a scale to watch these changes

858
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,680
and they're doing quite well

859
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:06,350
families are reporting some improvement

860
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:09,049
in cognition overall the patients are

861
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:12,110
happier the families are happier and the

862
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:15,880
staff is much happier so this is going

863
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:19,030
on at this time these are not I are be

864
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,530
approved studies these are people in

865
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,900
institutions whose families want

866
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:26,269
cannabis used and under California law

867
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,269
we're able to do this for them so I

868
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:31,789
would hope to put some light on this as

869
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:33,949
far as what we are already doing some of

870
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:36,230
the doses have to go up very high and/or

871
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:39,588
to cover the needs for these agitated

872
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:42,949
patients up to 30 milligrams of THC and

873
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:45,529
CBD per dose in order to control some of

874
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:47,539
these very very agitated behaviors it's

875
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:50,269
not only helping the agitated behaviors

876
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:53,989
it's helping the pain the insomnia and

877
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:56,509
and many other aspects of these elderly

878
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:58,669
patients so could I just clarify that so

879
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:01,550
you you give them a dose of 10

880
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:07,400
milligrams THC plus 10 milligrams CBD

881
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:09,740
one time one per dose correct for

882
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,838
Hallett or max and then you have a

883
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:13,909
sustained effect after that how when do

884
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,529
you reduce them usually they get a dose

885
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:19,250
first thing in the morning again

886
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:22,280
sundowning at about 3 p.m. it's a daily

887
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:26,510
dose you use this is a this is not a

888
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:29,390
divided dose this is a per dose so we

889
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:31,849
may go it's 2 or 3 times daily in this

890
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:33,858
patient population thank you yeah and

891
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,859
one of the elements of that just to add

892
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:38,779
on that because of the the duration that

893
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:41,000
it takes for the cannabinoids to get on

894
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,769
board when you take it orally and the

895
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,318
bioavailability is significantly

896
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:48,858
impaired as well as we move forward with

897
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:50,659
different delivery mechanisms you know

898
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:52,578
we talk about the mucosal oral

899
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:54,429
absorption but there's other routes as

900
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:56,990
well be it nasal sprays for the more

901
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:58,879
quicker onset of action it's going to

902
00:39:56,989 --> 00:40:01,189
give us an ability to titrate throughout

903
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,800
aggressive behavior in a slightly

904
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:06,500
different way as well that is true and

905
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,210
we are able to use oral doses as a PRN

906
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,659
order as well in this patient population

907
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:13,220
for agitation and insomnia thank you and

908
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,750
just in the interest of time I know

909
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:16,338
there's about six people standing right

910
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,929
now please and I just remind us to keep

911
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:19,279
we'll keep the questions to questions

912
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:20,480
and then and keep them brief because we

913
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,790
only have ten minutes and there's six

914
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,349
questions we have to get through hi

915
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:26,239
thank you guys for everything that

916
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:28,460
you're doing are you familiar with dr.

917
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,009
Chow at University of Florida's work on

918
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,588
Heil elects he's using THC curcumin and

919
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:38,000
melatonin as treatment for Alzheimer's

920
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:41,539
and I agree with dr. Jeff my mom with

921
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Alzheimer's uses cannabis as well as

922
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:47,529
another friend same dose roughly 11 CBD

923
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:52,210
7 THC

924
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:55,570
times a day and helps remarkably I'm not

925
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:57,880
familiar with that word well there are

926
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:02,170
some animal rodents studies in

927
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:05,800
transgenic mice on combination of CBD

928
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:08,740
and THC and also with I think THC and

929
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:13,420
CBD alone and if there's some variation

930
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:16,750
and their results and so I can't I won't

931
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,099
say anything specific but in general

932
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,980
there seems to be an improvement it

933
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:24,719
tends to agree with what we've found in

934
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:29,800
behind simpler systems actually and

935
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:32,259
there is of a pretty high-end paper and

936
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:37,110
I believe Nature Medicine a year or so

937
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:39,670
ago showing the THC when put into the

938
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:42,340
directly into the brain has an effect

939
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:45,250
and positive effect on memory and older

940
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:48,340
animals so there's mounting scientific

941
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:50,349
evidence that these compounds actually

942
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:53,200
have an effect also there's a great

943
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:54,849
documentary called prescribed grass some

944
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,210
people might be familiar with it about

945
00:41:54,849 --> 00:42:01,210
this population in Israel but I think

946
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,400
what you gotta distinguishes are these

947
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:06,369
things working do you need the

948
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,530
psychoactive component or not and my

949
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:10,480
feeling is in our the way we've looked

950
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:14,440
at it you really don't for the things

951
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,659
that we look at and so I think the

952
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,700
emphasis should be maybe on some other

953
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:23,250
compounds as he bd+ maybe other

954
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:23,250
compounds in cannabis do more research

955
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:28,089
we're gonna and again we got it we got

956
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:29,920
it we got eight minutes we got four more

957
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,780
questions to go through please keep your

958
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,970
questions to questions yeah it was just

959
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,340
curious if any of you guys especially at

960
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:38,289
UCLA or in general know of collaboration

961
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,300
with dr. Bredesen x' work on his kind of

962
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,699
root cause approach to Alzheimer's

963
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,800
prevention and treatment and using the

964
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:46,500
endocannabinoid or Fido cannabinoids you

965
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,670
know in collaboration with him at all

966
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:55,119
have we haven't been collaborating with

967
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:58,570
him hi I'm sorry more of a comment -

968
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,150
from Canada in the in I'm a cannabinoid

969
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,490
physician and specifically I do see a

970
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,099
lot

971
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:07,929
of patients in long-term care setting

972
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:10,639
and just to your point we are seeing

973
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:14,149
some real efficacy with reducing

974
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:17,239
responsive behaviors generally the the

975
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:20,180
dosing we're seeing is one part THC four

976
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:22,129
parts CBD for most of the the oils we're

977
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:23,719
using and it's really interesting

978
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,869
because in Ontario again we can do these

979
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:28,579
we have these anecdotal evidence but

980
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:30,650
antipsychotics without a diagnosis is a

981
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:31,969
reportable outcome for the government

982
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,690
when they do inspections of long-term

983
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:37,449
care homes so it's really we're really

984
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:40,340
utilizing it to reduce our

985
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:42,829
antipsychotics in that setting a because

986
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:45,170
it's the government's mandating it and B

987
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:47,299
were having success doing it Sunnybrook

988
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,700
just there's a study going on they're

989
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,940
using NAB alone and that'll be the first

990
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:54,859
randomized control trial study and the

991
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,159
evidence shows that they they had some

992
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,869
efficacy with nav alone reducing

993
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,250
responsive behaviors with dementia so

994
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:02,539
that's a new one it's not I don't think

995
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:09,739
it's published but that data was

996
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:12,920
presented at a conference in Chicago do

997
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:14,689
you have a question yes okay good this

998
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,470
is going back to dr. small I think you

999
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:21,019
mean a comment about the shrinkage that

1000
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:23,689
can occur with prolonged use of cannabis

1001
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:26,900
specifically in adolescents my question

1002
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,760
is are are there isolated studies where

1003
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,550
we know that that's occurring based on

1004
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,730
cannabis uses usage as opposed to maybe

1005
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:35,450
also alcohol playing playing a role in

1006
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,260
that

1007
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:42,980
so did I see you at Woodstock I'm trying

1008
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:47,990
to no no then you bring up a point there

1009
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:49,969
could be some related behaviors that

1010
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:52,759
could have contributed to that and those

1011
00:44:49,969 --> 00:44:55,339
studies didn't show shrinkage in

1012
00:44:52,760 --> 00:45:00,230
adolescents that showed shrinkage when

1013
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:02,920
those adolescents were older so there

1014
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:05,809
could be confounded variables of course

1015
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,840
yes that's right that's what I've come

1016
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:11,269
across so I mean we try to control for

1017
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:14,990
them in the studies but it's it's never

1018
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:16,789
100% unless you're doing a prospective

1019
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:18,859
mais controlled trial it's often very

1020
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:21,170
difficult to tease out those confounds

1021
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,820
but to even catch an effect like that

1022
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,369
in any sort of a clinical trial them

1023
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,869
sorry to catch an effect like that in a

1024
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:28,880
sort of clinical trial the follow-up

1025
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:30,289
would have to be quite long well the way

1026
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,730
it's done yeah it have to be quite long

1027
00:45:30,289 --> 00:45:33,980
the way that study was done they

1028
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,809
recruited people who you know have you

1029
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,860
been a heavy marijuana user in the past

1030
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:38,659
that's how they did it

1031
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,300
yeah and the issue with that is what are

1032
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:43,909
they using exactly right

1033
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,890
is it 2 percent is it 15 percent is it

1034
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:48,379
20 percent is it contaminated does it

1035
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:50,000
have secondary pesticide you know what I

1036
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:52,220
mean there's that's the problem with a

1037
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,449
lot of the states that the studies are

1038
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:55,039
out of they come out of the US no

1039
00:45:53,449 --> 00:46:00,230
disrespect intended I used to work here

1040
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:02,420
but the the studies aren't legit okay

1041
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,860
they say okay people are using this no

1042
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,480
they don't know what they're using so

1043
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,950
how can you have a clinical outcome

1044
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:15,829
based on what you don't even know what

1045
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:18,109
you're doing well first of all I

1046
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:20,119
wouldn't say that the studies are not

1047
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:22,670
legit you know I would say it's a

1048
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,890
different kind of study and the quality

1049
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:27,380
you know the the how compelling the

1050
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:29,420
evidences depends on the design so

1051
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,150
usually when these studies are published

1052
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,639
in peer-reviewed refereed journals the

1053
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:38,269
referees look at all those details to

1054
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:41,089
try so that what are interpreted is it's

1055
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:43,269
done in a fair manner so it but I would

1056
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:46,400
say that a randomized controlled trial

1057
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:48,710
usually if it's done well gives you more

1058
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:56,500
compelling evidences called as in terms

1059
00:46:48,710 --> 00:47:00,880
of cause and effect thank you I

1060
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:03,349
represent dr. Romer Sean and that first

1061
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,180
intro presentation he went through was

1062
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:10,699
talking about how we've been able to

1063
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:13,579
stabilize the acids sorry so I represent

1064
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:15,230
dr. Raphael mushrooms company and what

1065
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:17,239
we've been able to do with Raphael is

1066
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,829
stabilize the acids and then create

1067
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,868
their synthetic derivatives of those and

1068
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:22,279
you're mentioning that that's certainly

1069
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:25,070
a part that you've been taking and I'd

1070
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:28,900
like to hear voices around that versus

1071
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:32,330
the actual natural plan

1072
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,590
I'm yeah I'm familiar with his work but

1073
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:36,019
I didn't quite understand the question

1074
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:37,510
so the question there was you're

1075
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:39,710
obviously going through the synthetic

1076
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:43,310
option which is something that we're

1077
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:45,289
pursuing well I mean this is the for us

1078
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:47,210
it's very difficult to do anything but

1079
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:49,579
that because we don't have the

1080
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:52,070
facilities or the means to do there any

1081
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:54,920
clinical trials and considering how it

1082
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:56,360
is difficult it is to do and to work

1083
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,090
with natural products and get any

1084
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:02,840
leverage as far as interest in it it's

1085
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:07,280
in in in some sense I mean Alzheimer's a

1086
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:09,350
particularly difficult field so that's

1087
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,890
what we're doing yeah our the goal is to

1088
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:15,529
try to find a natural some components in

1089
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:17,179
the marijuana plant that are effective

1090
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:19,160
and we have to test these animal models

1091
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:22,549
and really look good then we can modify

1092
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:25,149
them chemically to be able to make them

1093
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:28,370
into better compounds and some of the

1094
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:30,440
metabolism of the of the cannabinoids is

1095
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:33,880
tricky I mean they break down quite

1096
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:37,309
readily some of them CBD it's it's so

1097
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,440
they're from the chemistry point of view

1098
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:41,480
there's ways to improve these compounds

1099
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,090
and that's what we have done and that's

1100
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,369
or where we're focusing have you been

1101
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:49,610
working with the actual acids as such or

1102
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:53,359
just the molecules of the plant we're

1103
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:55,340
just that we've actually just starting

1104
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,559
this we're just applied for an NIH grant

1105
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:00,620
try to work on this we've done some work

1106
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:03,590
with stuff we can buy chemicals can have

1107
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:08,599
it always we can purchase but we're just

1108
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:10,130
starting their work thanks hi my name is

1109
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:11,869
Dustin Sulak I'm an osteopathic

1110
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:13,910
physician I've been practicing

1111
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:16,069
cannabinoid medicine in Maine for the

1112
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:18,379
last nine years and one thing that we

1113
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:20,630
often see in cannabinoid medicine is a

1114
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,160
failure of clinical trials to be well

1115
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:24,349
informed by those of us on the front

1116
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,179
lines with clinical experience so I'm

1117
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:29,119
really glad that you brought up this

1118
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:31,489
topic of kind of reverse translation and

1119
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,469
I my question to the panelists is how

1120
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:34,909
can you inform yourselves on what's

1121
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:36,500
happening in the world of klint

1122
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:38,509
cannabinoid medicine on the front lines

1123
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,550
so that you get better efficacy and

1124
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,690
results in your trials and development

1125
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,339
of

1126
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,769
that are more likely to help people for

1127
00:49:42,338 --> 00:49:46,900
example in my practice I find like dr.

1128
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:49,000
Hogan rather the THC is extremely

1129
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,190
important and effective at sparing

1130
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,108
antipsychotics benzodiazepines and other

1131
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,760
beers list medicines and that there's

1132
00:49:53,108 --> 00:49:56,619
typically a therapeutic window where

1133
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,390
there's a dose that reduces agitation

1134
00:49:56,619 --> 00:50:02,740
and a higher dose that produces

1135
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:04,420
intoxication well the only way you can

1136
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:06,279
get around that and their problem is you

1137
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,289
got to do it in people so you can go

1138
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,780
through all the toxicology studies that

1139
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:13,929
those response studies and try you try

1140
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:15,849
initially animals to get some idea how

1141
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:17,769
much blood concentration you need in

1142
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:20,588
order to get a therapeutic effect and

1143
00:50:17,769 --> 00:50:23,469
then you have to find a safe dose and

1144
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:25,389
then work go tenfold Laura that started

1145
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:27,250
you know with human see as they

1146
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:29,889
metabolize the drug the same way as in

1147
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,599
animals and so now you're sort of doing

1148
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:34,929
this backwards everything is going

1149
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,250
you're from humans to animals so that's

1150
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:38,949
the question how that's going to work

1151
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,210
out in the long term we'll see so so we

1152
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:41,529
are we are out of time but I wanted to

1153
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,699
add one thing to that is that we

1154
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,440
actually have a road map just like how

1155
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:46,210
the development of curcumin is almost a

1156
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,818
roadmap for potentially how we pursue

1157
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:51,369
cannabinoids as natural products the the

1158
00:50:48,818 --> 00:50:54,219
FDA recent approval of epidemics that

1159
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:56,050
was based off of overwhelming anecdotal

1160
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,879
data that precipitated drug development

1161
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:59,500
and interest so there is a way to do

1162
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,269
this there is a roadmap and it's how can

1163
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,920
we learn through prospective

1164
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:05,380
observational studies through surveys

1165
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,760
and to help us design the clinical

1166
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,318
trials and understand the questions we

1167
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,520
need to be asking and unfortunately

1168
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,500
we're out of time but I just wanted to

1169
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,818
wrap up everything that was spoken about

1170
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,119
here give us a round of applause for our

1171
00:51:12,818 --> 00:51:19,059
panelists at the end of the day sound

1172
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:20,588
data data is mixed it's inconclusive

1173
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:20,980
there's a lot of work that needs to be

1174
00:51:20,588 --> 00:51:23,949
done

1175
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,389
animals aren't humans and last thing I'd

1176
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:27,009
like to add is that the use of

1177
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:28,900
cannabinoids for Alzheimer's disease for

1178
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,130
both disease modification as well as

1179
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,559
symptom management that's one of our

1180
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,789
priority areas here at the UCLA cannabis

1181
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,920
research initiative so thank you very

1182
00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:38,909
much enjoy lunch one more round of

1183
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,909
applause for our panelists
