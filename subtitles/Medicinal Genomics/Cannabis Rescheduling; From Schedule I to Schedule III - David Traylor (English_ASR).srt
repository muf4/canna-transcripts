1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,629
[Music]

2
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,759
of a lot of people's minds as we move

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,399
into 20124 was this whole idea of the

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,240
possibility of the DEA rescheduling

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,799
cannabis from a schedule one drug to a

6
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,959
schedule three um was interested to get

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,439
your thoughts on that um if you think

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,960
that's going to happen when maybe you

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,719
think that's going to happen and what

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,160
does that really mean for investment in

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,000
the uh in the industry well I mean first

12
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,919
off to say I think most people agree out

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,558
there that there's no crystal ball for

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,359
cannabis uh it's really a hard industry

15
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,280
to predict but that being said I was

16
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:51,159
looking through some old emails over the

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,840
holiday Ben and pulled up uh some

18
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,679
material that we've been asked to put

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,680
together for an ic3 event which is many

20
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,920
people in the know or not in the know

21
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,238
but they've been around the block in

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,600
this industry this was New York in 20

23
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:07,478
October

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,320
2018 and uh Al Foreman was part of this

25
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:11,840
uh piece of paper uh that was put

26
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,039
together a number of us were asked to

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,920
kind of provide our predictions Tom

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,320
Zuber uh VI Desa a number of people and

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
one of the things that we came out with

30
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,879
looking at is trying to predict in five

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,320
years what the sector is going to look

32
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,239
like one of the first things we started

33
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,478
off with was how many medical states are

34
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:34,039
there going to be in five years and we

35
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,879
did some simple math but we essentially

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,680
said that they're going to be 40 States

37
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,239
in in DC they're legal and Frankly

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,799
Speaking if you look back at it right

39
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:46,519
now and that was October 2018 five years

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,840
ago uh we hit the nail on the head

41
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,319
frankly and so not again there's no

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,359
Crystal Ball but the other thing that we

43
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,118
like to do at Golden Eagle Partners is

44
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,000
we're very quantitative again I have a

45
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,879
degree in Biochemistry and a degree

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,599
degree in molecular biology luckily I

47
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,560
have three patents us patents to my name

48
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,599
so we're very analytical and

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,159
quantitative and so many of you may have

50
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,318
seen uh the piece that we put out on

51
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:15,199
LinkedIn mid December on trying to

52
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:18,318
actually apply some of the data that the

53
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,318
DEA you know we looked at the how many

54
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,359
uh compounds had been scheduled

55
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,598
rescheduled or descheduled in the last

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,920
five years and it was actually the

57
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,359
answer was

58
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,079
41 and then we looked at you know

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,360
applied when of those actually happen

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,800
What quarter of uh each calendar year

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,280
from 2018 on and uh and then we applied

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,280
that analysis to when we may might think

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,280
what this might happen and you know

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,878
again it's hard to predict but you know

65
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,400
coming of our analysis we thought you

66
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:49,039
know there's a 10% chance

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,719
that uh that it won't even be a schedule

68
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,519
uh schedule three it might be a schedule

69
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,519
two uh but then if it's a schedule three

70
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,680
then you know when might that happen our

71
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,759
thought was you know there's probably

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,159
25% chance that if they reschedule to

73
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,560
schedule three it might not even happen

74
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,840
before the election so that means and

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,039
again this is just kind of applying some

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,598
trying to sense to it and I think

77
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,719
everybody had agree listening to this

78
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,759
that there's not 100% chance that the de

79
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:17,959
is going to reschedule this yeah uh

80
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,560
before the election uh but that being

81
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,598
said out of the 75% chance we applied

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,920
that to the data that we saw and when

83
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,719
these events happen when the da

84
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,119
announces he's in the Federal Register

85
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,719
and our analysis came up with the best

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,519
chances in Q2 that it will

87
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:37,840
be uh rescheduled 41% chance that it'll

88
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,080
happen in Q2 now we've also heard people

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,680
thinking that the da is going to

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,400
announce a rescheduling of cannabis on

91
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,840
April uh you know 20th 420 but I can't

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,039
imagine that the The Da is going to play

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,799
to the the Cannabis sector as a matter

94
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,039
of fact one of the points we don't think

95
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,040
they're going to play to the Canabis

96
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,239
sector and that's one thing that during

97
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,438
the benzinga podcast with Hunter land

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,719
you know our thought is it's probably

99
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,158
not going to happen before the election

100
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,519
but one of the data points you know that

101
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,679
not many people saw is I think is

102
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,759
December 12th just uh less than a month

103
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,680
ago the da announced adding another six

104
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,679
compound to schedule one and these are

105
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,079
cannabis

106
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,358
memetics now they're they're not

107
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,680
naturally occurring cannabinoids and

108
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,079
they're not even cannaboids they're

109
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,400
cannabis mics but mimetics but they do

110
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,758
hit the CB1 CB2

111
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,079
receptor and you know I I don't think

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,759
it's out of the realm of imagination to

113
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,560
assume that the da was thumbing their

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,000
nose at the Cannabis sector by throwing

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,800
these and essentially again to be clear

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
clear Ben it's a the da put these six

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,038
compounds on a temporary preliminary

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,279
schedule one and after a year if they

119
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,839
their findings come to fruition they

120
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,439
will then keep it on or take it off

121
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,719
schedule one my guess is though that

122
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,839
most people don't realize that there are

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,919
43 cannabis or cannabis memetic

124
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:02,560
cannabinoid Associated compounds on

125
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:05,198
schedule one right now H and so now

126
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,160
let's add to the 43 to the six so now

127
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,759
there's 49 43 was the number before

128
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,280
December uh and now there's 49 the other

129
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,439
thing that's so screwed up about this

130
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,758
whole thing that we we've want to make

131
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,879
him really important is that there's

132
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,080
over 500 compounds that are

133
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,839
scheduled uh by the de on schedule one

134
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,560
through

135
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,519
five and of those there's only one of

136
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,319
those is not a compound that's cannabis

137
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,959
Canabis is not a compound cannabis is a

138
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,840
plant it's a Genus as we mentioned so

139
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,879
this whole thing about trying to apply

140
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,119
analysis and logic to what the da is

141
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,959
going to do this is really hard to do

142
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,680
because again the whole the whole logic

143
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,399
behind this again if you're applying the

144
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,800
the

145
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,198
biochemistry perspective on this

146
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,280
cannabis is not a compound it's a

147
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,240
collection of 500 plus compounds and

148
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,399
more than that probably right yeah and

149
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:01,759
so having them reschedule or deschedule

150
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,758
cannabis as itself you know it's

151
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:17,160
[Music]

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,160
ridiculous
