thrilled to be able to talk with Ethan

38
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:44,140
Russo Ethan has been studying the

39
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,239
medicinal effects of cannabis and the

40
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,219
endocannabinoid system for as long as

41
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,199
anyone perhaps with the exception of

42
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:53,319
Professor Raphael McCollum who

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,180
coincidentally his Ethan's mentor he has

44
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,669
authored several peer-reviewed articles

45
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,860
and book chapters served as an advisor

46
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,500
for cannabis companies and publications

47
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:04,478
and spoken at all the top cannabis

48
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,659
conferences around the globe including

49
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:10,149
can med in fact I encourage anyone who's

50
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,849
interested to check out his chem ed 2018

51
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,579
presentation about the link between the

52
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:17,979
cannabinoid system cannabis and the gut

53
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:20,290
microbiome we get into that a little bit

54
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:22,269
in our conversation but we also cover

55
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:24,539
some of the cannabis medicine basics

56
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,590
like what is the endocannabinoid system

57
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,539
so for any listeners who

58
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,120
new to cannabis medicine this should

59
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:32,829
give you a good foundation having said

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,159
that there's still plenty of meat on the

61
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,390
bone if you're a more advanced listener

62
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,000
before I play you my conversation with

63
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:42,159

[Music]

76
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:25,090
good morning Ethan thank you so much for

77
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,590
joining us on the podcast thank you

78
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,939
first I want to say that we're so

79
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,370
excited to have you as a keynote

80
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:34,430
presenter this year I was watching your

81
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,069
can bed 2018 presentation in in

82
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,710
preparation for the call and that was

83
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,659
only 15 minutes which just was not

84
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,969
enough time so I'm really happy that

85
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,770
we've blocked off a full hour for you

86
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,229
this time because I know you have a lot

87
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,650
of great information to share yeah ah to

88
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:54,319
be a luxury that I'm happy to exploit

89
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,480
because the topic cannabis and

90
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,609
psychiatry is a really broad one and

91
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:02,509
it's been an under-recognized and

92
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,680
underutilized area absolutely and I'm

93
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,340
really excited to talked with you about

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,300
that

95
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,950
but I was hoping you'd indulge me and we

96
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,080
could kind of start with the basics

97
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,569
because I imagine there are some people

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,730
who are new to the podcast new to can

99
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,709
med who maybe are just starting their

100
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,689
cannabis journey and maybe don't have

101
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,329
sort of that foundational knowledge so

102
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:25,189
let's just let's start from the top and

103
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,769
I was wondering if you give us a brief

104
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:29,209
primer on what is the endocannabinoid

105
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:32,469
system sure

106
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:35,949
well the endocannabinoid system has been

107
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:38,750
known for about 30 years and then on

108
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:43,539
development during that time and it

109
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:45,970
basically is the major homeostatic

110
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,530
regulatory system of our physiology

111
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,870
let's break that down because it's a

112
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:52,879
mouthful

113
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,879
basically the endocannabinoid system is

114
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:58,699
what keeps the rest of how we function

115
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,290
and balance so if there is too much

116
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,569
activity in the system the

117
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:05,480
endocannabinoids system tends to bring

118
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:07,459
it down into the normal level and on the

119
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,210
other hand if there is an underactive

120
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:14,680
system it increases the game back into

121
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:19,939
the normal level now how this was

122
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:23,780
discovered was that about 1990 it was

123
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:27,410
found that there are receptors were THC

124
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:29,899
binds and not only that but that we have

125
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,409
endogenous cannabinoids cannabinoids

126
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:38,209
within that also bind to the

127
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:42,259
receptor on as it turns out this is what

128
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:43,999
regulates neurotransmitter release for

129
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,528
the various neurotransmitters in the

130
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:51,199
brain but it also regulates emotion

131
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:53,569
movement pain whether someone will have

132
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,080
a seizure or not whether they're likely

133
00:05:53,569 --> 00:06:01,360
to vomit or not it regulates digestion

134
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,359
and almost every function of the body

135
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:04,848
Wow

136
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:07,699
so that's fascinating and I think a lot

137
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:10,668
of people are surprised to hear that so

138
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,829
I know the cannabis has been used for

139
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:17,209
medicine for a long time and it's only

140
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:19,579
now sort of gaining exposure again so in

141
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:21,619
addition to cannabis what other sorts of

142
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,929
activities or foods can kind of

143
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:27,259
stimulate the body's production of those

144
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:29,028
and endogenous cannabinoids well there

145
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:32,360
are actually a lot of things and it's a

146
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:35,808
complicated topic the one clear one at

147
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,819
this point is aerobic exercise that

148
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:40,369
seems to increase the gain of the

149
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:42,800
endocannabinoid system it's been shown

150
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:45,579
that that boosts levels of an and amide

151
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,860
which is natural chemical in the body

152
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:53,478
that is very akin in its function nor to

153
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:56,209
THC in terms of diet there's no one food

154
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:58,579
that I could tell people is going to

155
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:01,759
improve their under cannabinoid function

156
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:03,588
a lot of people have wondered about fish

157
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,189
oil and these kinds of things and that

158
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:10,098
can be very healthful but there isn't a

159
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:13,009
1:1 relationship between what you eat

160
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:15,978
and what your endocannabinoid function

161
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:18,588
is going to be if I were gonna suggest

162
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:21,649
the simplest thing that seems to provide

163
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:25,908
benefit it would be prebiotics and

164
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:28,848
probiotics probiotics are going to be

165
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:33,199
familiar to most people as the natural

166
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:36,168
bacteria that are is in yogurt and

167
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,139
various fermented foods and the

168
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:42,019
prebiotics are generally vegetative

169
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,550
matter that these bacteria likes that

170
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:47,780
promote their growth

171
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:51,050
why this is important is because these

172
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:54,679
bacteria reside in the gut on as it

173
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,750
turns out they are really key to not

174
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,290
only our nutrition but brain function on

175
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:05,810
various other aspects of our health and

176
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:09,250
it's a problem in modern life because

177
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:13,850
the modern American diet in particular

178
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:17,420
tends to be pro-inflammatory on and has

179
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:20,270
been associated with the vast increases

180
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,580
in a number of autoimmune diseases which

181
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:26,299
were quite rare in the 19th century when

182
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:28,269
people eat quite differently so when

183
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,240
people are cognizant of these

184
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:35,329
nutritional issues they really can help

185
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,870
themselves out in fighting chronic

186
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,520
disease at the same time that they're

187
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:47,029
increasing their endocannabinoid tone

188
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:49,460
now this would be I imagine and gross

189
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,649
over simplification but you can't

190
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,019
continue to have you know that standard

191
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,419
American diet and then just ingest

192
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:59,600
cannabinoids and expect to have an

193
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:03,529
improvement or Kenya well again it's

194
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,430
complicated this is very surprising but

195
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:09,829
it's been shown that THC actually favors

196
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:14,029
certain gut bacteria that are more

197
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:17,450
helpful and is the reason that chronic

198
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:20,990
cannabis users tend to be lean rather

199
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:24,980
than overweight as one might expect due

200
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:27,409
to the well known munchies effect so

201
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,170
it's true the THC stimulates hunger but

202
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:33,409
in fact it alters the gut bacteria in a

203
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:36,549
way that helps prevent obesity so

204
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:40,789
supplemental cannabinoids from cannabis

205
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:43,250
can improve the situation but you know

206
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:46,490
not everyone is going to resort to that

207
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,409
and there are again these nutritional

208
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,759
approaches with prebiotics and

209
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:56,439
probiotics that can provide hopefully on

210
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,439
the same measures of protection

211
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:01,850
and now does the delivery mechanism

212
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:04,980
matter when ingesting cannabinoids ah

213
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,470
well certainly in this instance oral use

214
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,190
is going to be better I don't advocate

215
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:14,310
smoking for medical use and vaporization

216
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:17,430
is better but there are still issues um

217
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:19,979
if someone needs has a condition for

218
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:22,859
which they need chronic administration

219
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,379
of a cannabis based product and almost

220
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,019
always oral administration or oral

221
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:33,088
mucosal with tinctures is going to be

222
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:34,948
preferred excellent I was wondering if

223
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:37,170
you could kind of explain sort of what

224
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:39,149
is the mechanism with how these

225
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,278
cannabinoids interact with the body you

226
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:43,320
had mentioned receptors before but sort

227
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,629
of walk us through when when you ingest

228
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,600
cannabis sort of what's the what's going

229
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:51,028
on in the body well first I have to

230
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,329
point out how complicated it is there

231
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:56,220
are at least 150 natural cannabinoids in

232
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:59,129
the plant and they're quite distinct in

233
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,589
their function so on the one hand THC

234
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:04,139
works directly on cannabinoid receptors

235
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:08,040
are the cb1 receptor which is

236
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:10,549
predominant in the brain and cb2 which

237
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:14,549
is a non psychoactive receptor that's

238
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:19,500
immunomodulatory also involved in pain

239
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:23,309
and reduction of inflammation so

240
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:26,519
different ones work differently a CBD

241
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:29,969
cannabidiol actually doesn't bind

242
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:34,379
directly very well at all to c b1 or c

243
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:37,350
b2 on c b1 it does alter the binding of

244
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:41,578
THC in a way that helps reduce THC

245
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:44,519
Associated side-effects but on CBD acts

246
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:46,879
on a whole bunch of other mechanisms in

247
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:52,409
the body primarily to reduce

248
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:54,629
inflammation but also like THC is

249
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:57,620
antiemetic it reduces nausea and

250
00:11:54,629 --> 00:12:01,049
vomiting it's also associated with

251
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,269
anti-anxiety effects and antipsychotic

252
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:07,439
effects which are contrary to what

253
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:09,720
excesses of THC will do and then there

254
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,600
are a whole bunch of other activities

255
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,699
with CBD another one would be working

256
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,220
directly on another receptor called the

257
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:20,159
trip v1 receptor which is the same place

258
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,339
where capsaicin the active ingredient

259
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:27,328
chili peppers works but CBD isn't

260
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:29,250
caustic the way capsaicin is so yeah I

261
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:31,578
mean we could go on and on for an hour

262
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,659
just on that topic

263
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:36,448
sure and that brings up an interesting

264
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:39,870
point because there is sort of a debate

265
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:42,149
between health care professionals about

266
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,629
what's better the whole plant medicine

267
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,759
or these single compounds and it sounds

268
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:50,399
from what you were just describing that

269
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,740
getting a combination of different

270
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,899
compounds is what really drives the

271
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,409
medicinal effect well I'm a firm

272
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,990
believer in that there's been a movement

273
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:04,458
by some companies towards producing

274
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:06,839
cannabinoids either by bacteria yeasts

275
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,849
but they're never going to have the

276
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,069
range of activities that a whole

277
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,069
cannabis extract will with its

278
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:15,448
combination of ingredients there's a

279
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:18,509
term for this called the entourage

280
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:20,639
effect that refers to synergies between

281
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:23,730
different components and that can

282
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:28,049
consists of boosting a positive effect

283
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:30,269
or reducing a negative side effect so I

284
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:34,378
think it's extremely unlikely than any

285
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:37,019
single compound will have the breath of

286
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:40,050
activity or the safety profile of our

287
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:44,938
properly constituted cannabis based

288
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:48,688
medicine and with so many different

289
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:51,828
strains and cultivars out there how hard

290
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:55,139
is it to sort of knit zero in on one

291
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:57,208
combination of cannabinoids flavonoids

292
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,220
terpenoids that really gets that desired

293
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:02,219
effect well I'm afraid it's really a

294
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,528
function of where somebody lives on in

295
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,180
certain jurisdictions mainly in the west

296
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:08,399
coast there's a wide variety of

297
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:11,609
available chemo VARs or chemical

298
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,679
varieties and it may be possible with

299
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,709
good labeling and good knowledge at

300
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,138
point of sale for someone to seek out

301
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:21,178
the profile of cannabinoids and

302
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,080
terpenoids that's going to be optimal to

303
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:25,659
treat their condition

304
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,020
that situation does not obtain most

305
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:31,569
places however so right now it's very

306
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:35,939
difficult I'm still hindered by the

307
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:39,540
continued prohibition on cannabis

308
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:42,700
so we're severely limited in what

309
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:47,039
industry can do and also the ability to

310
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:49,780
do research on these kinds of topics I

311
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,750
get Oh imagine consistency is another

312
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:57,579
issue I had a conversation recently with

313
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:59,470
a cannabis safety testing lab and the

314
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,139
woman I was speaking with was talking

315
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,000
about how just within the plant itself

316
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:07,289
different buds from different areas of

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,750
the plant can have really different

318
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:13,000
chemical profiles so I got to imagine

319
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,370
that's another reason why you probably

320
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,940
are advocating more for at entry based

321
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:21,190
type delivery systems ah sure what you

322
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:25,200
pointed out is quite true there's going

323
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:29,080
to be a different cannabinoid profile

324
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,870
mainly greater amounts in the top buds

325
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,430
rather than ones lower down on the plant

326
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:38,620
that might not get as much sun exposure

327
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:42,939
the way around this is through pooling

328
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:45,990
in other words if we had a field of

329
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:51,810
cannabis so you'd collect all the

330
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:55,810
flowers and extract them and with

331
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:58,869
cloning vegetative propagation and

332
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:01,989
uniform growing conditions best done in

333
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:05,169
a greenhouse it is absolutely possible

334
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:08,070
to get extreme levels of consistency

335
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:11,079
over time on that's precisely how

336
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:15,820
sativex the cannabis space medicine

337
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:18,490
developed in england which is um has

338
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,940
regulatory approval in 30 countries

339
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,190
that's exactly how it was produced so it

340
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,340
has been done it's not a simple process

341
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:30,280
it's a long process it's an expensive

342
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:35,800
process but it absolutely has been done

343
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:36,829
and can be done again okay so so going

344
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,949
back to these

345
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:41,629
endogenous cannabinoids now is there

346
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,910
sort of like a one-to-one relationship

347
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:46,870
between you know what the body produces

348
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:50,750
and what the plant produces in terms of

349
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,820
the compound no unfortunately it's

350
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,409
always more complicated than one might

351
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,100
hope

352
00:16:54,409 --> 00:17:01,250
as I've mentioned an and amide is quite

353
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,039
analogous to THC and they're both they

354
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,799
both are what are called weak partial

355
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:10,190
agonist at the cb1 receptor this is a

356
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,289
way of saying that they're not super

357
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,650
high potency they work through a great

358
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:18,470
deal of subtlety on this receptor that

359
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:21,500
is so widespread in the brain and body

360
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,799
to regulate neurotransmitter function

361
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,759
and all these other functions but there

362
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:33,019
is another main player let's say among

363
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:36,319
the endocannabinoids it's called - Iraq

364
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:38,509
or Donal glycerol - AG it's a little bit

365
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:42,379
different it works in different areas of

366
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:46,279
the brain it has a higher affinity for

367
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:49,430
the receptor so it's not a simple

368
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:51,379
relationship and they are all these

369
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,660
things are chemically distinct there are

370
00:17:51,380 --> 00:18:00,560
at least subtle differences and how they

371
00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:02,690
act in different places all right

372
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,119
interesting so I was wondering if you

373
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,029
could kind of share with us what

374
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:11,029
conditions have benefitted the most or I

375
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:13,519
should say what conditions have had the

376
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:16,430
most research to support cannabis as a

377
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:19,190
medicine oh sure well it's actually a

378
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:21,620
short list it's long been known the

379
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,289
benefits of THC in cannabis based

380
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:27,349
medicine and treating on nausea

381
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:31,369
associated with chemotherapy also in

382
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:33,559
aids wasting additionally sativex is

383
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:36,399
mentioned does approved in 30 countries

384
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:40,009
for spasticity or muscle tightness

385
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,870
associated with multiple sclerosis there

386
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:45,109
also has been a great deal of evidence

387
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:47,119
of certain cannabis preparations in

388
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:51,019
treating various types of chronic pain

389
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:54,539
especially neuropathic nerve based pain

390
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:57,329
beyond that we have a tremendous amount

391
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:59,308
of anecdotal evidence for a variety of

392
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:04,199
other conditions but it's not always

393
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:06,599
borne out in randomized clinical trials

394
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,830
now if we're talking about specifically

395
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,678
cannabidiol

396
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:13,500
it's an approved drug as epi dialogues

397
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,679
through the FDA for treatment of severe

398
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,470
epilepsy syndromes Lenox Gaston and

399
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:23,570
dravet syndrome and that's a relatively

400
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:25,880
recent event starting in 2018

401
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:29,849
additionally they've been to Phase two

402
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:34,410
clinical trials of pure cannabidiol in

403
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:36,329
high doses to treat schizophrenia and it

404
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,000
seemed to be as effective as

405
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:43,918
conventional drugs but with many fewer

406
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,599
side-effects all right and then on the

407
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,850
flip side what are some emerging

408
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:52,048
applications for cannabis therapeutics

409
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:55,619
well that's wide open um you know the

410
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:57,750
one of the exciting areas is treatment

411
00:19:55,619 --> 00:20:01,009
of primary cancer in other words using

412
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:03,509
high doses of cannabinoids to treat

413
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:07,609
cancer directly much as chemotherapy

414
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:10,829
would do the advantage there is that

415
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:14,129
most chemotherapy agents are highly

416
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:17,428
toxic in and of themselves whereas the

417
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:20,090
cannabinoids are selective in their

418
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:23,070
ability to kill cancer but are not

419
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:27,839
damaging to normal cells so this is a

420
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:30,058
distinct difference and beyond that

421
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,970
there's the whole era psychiatry which

422
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:36,660
is heretofore been sort of a forbidden

423
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:40,950
territory but really needs further

424
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:45,179
investigation for the vast kinds of

425
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:49,009
improvements that properly constituted

426
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:51,240
cannabis based medicine could provide

427
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:52,710
yeah so let's get into that because I

428
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,890
know that is going to be the topic of

429
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:58,769
your presentation this year

430
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:02,730
oh sure well you know let's talk about

431
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:05,039
different conditions there was an one of

432
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:08,069
the most interesting areas is

433
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,899
post-traumatic stress on some years ago

434
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:13,109
there was an excellent study by matt

435
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:17,280
hill at all that looked at survivors of

436
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:19,259
the 9/11 tragedy on there were two

437
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,859
groups there were people that were in

438
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:25,019
the area and lower manhattan to the

439
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,599
events there that develop post-traumatic

440
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:30,210
stress and then people that were there

441
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:33,418
that did not and they looked at the

442
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,250
cerebrospinal fluid using spinal taps on

443
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,240
these people and showed clear

444
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:40,619
differences there was a deficit of

445
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,099
endocannabinoids in the people develop

446
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:46,918
pious PTSD as opposed to those who

447
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:49,889
didn't have post-traumatic stress and

448
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,860
this is a demonstration of deficient

449
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:55,400
endocannabinoid function in people with

450
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:55,399
post-traumatic stress

451
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,730
similarly on severe depression people

452
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:07,399
may be aware that when drugs fail on

453
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:09,870
there is still a technique called

454
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,360
electroconvulsive therapy or shock

455
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:16,048
therapy for people with severe

456
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:19,139
depression so what that does as a side

457
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:21,569
effect is produces some short-term

458
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:25,500
memory impairment at the same time that

459
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:27,480
there's a rapid improvement in mood now

460
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,210
a long time ago it occurred to me that

461
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,150
gee I wonder if the endocannabinoid

462
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,460
system is involved in this effect and a

463
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:39,840
couple of years ago in Germany in fact

464
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:43,490
after ECT treatments it was shown that

465
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:46,109
there were big increases in the

466
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:49,859
endocannabinoid levels as opposed to

467
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:53,779
before treatment so this is a certain

468
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:55,019
demonstration of the importance of

469
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:59,879
cannabinoids

470
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:02,660
in depression similarly anxiety is

471
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,790
definitely associated with

472
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,880
endocannabinoid deficiencies and as

473
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:10,119
already mentioned does in schizophrenia

474
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,260
although it's true

475
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:18,509
too much THC at a young age in a

476
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:26,140
predisposed individual could unmask

477
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:27,960
psychosis I caused a psychotic break in

478
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,730
fact though

479
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,000
cannabidiol is an effective treatment

480
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:38,380
for schizophrenia itself so those are

481
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,420
just a few examples those are some very

482
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,390
interesting examples I had never heard

483
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:46,990
that that factoid about the folks with

484
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:49,840
at 9/11 kind of having a very different

485
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:52,990
response with PTSD and it's being tied

486
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,889
back to endow cannabinoids that's

487
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,900
fascinating

488
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,660
oh sure you know and it supplements a

489
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,820
whole bunch of animal work which you

490
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,500
know sometimes is illuminating and

491
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:07,230
sometimes it's not but this has clearly

492
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:09,910
study done in humans very much on point

493
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,259
so now you know and I'm glad that you

494
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,840
brought up endocannabinoid deficiency

495
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:15,460
because when I was sort of gathering my

496
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,319
research for this conversation and

497
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,350
reading about the endocannabinoid system

498
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,419
I immediately went there and thought

499
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:24,039
that you know if this is something that

500
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,990
the body is producing there must be some

501
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,119
people who are deficient on it and sure

502
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,150
enough I googled it and whose name comes

503
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:33,909
up but Ethan Rousseau because you did

504
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:38,740
obviously a lot of a lot of research

505
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:41,650
into this going back many years so I'm

506
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,140
curious what causes this deficiency is

507
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,830
it because of diet is that behavior is

508
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,600
it genetic

509
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:50,079
there is a combination of all those

510
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:53,349
things yeah it is all of the above so

511
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:56,230
this is a theory I developed about 2000

512
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:58,509
was published first in 2001 more

513
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:03,400
extensively in 2004 then with a

514
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:06,160
follow-up paper in 2016 and the idea was

515
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,880
that we know that many neurologic

516
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,910
conditions especially are due to

517
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,830
neurotransmitter deficiencies so I

518
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,420
hypothesized well why won't there be

519
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:18,939
conditions in which there is a

520
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:22,720
deficiency of endocannabinoid function

521
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:24,788
and if so what would it look like and

522
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,630
certain things came to mind and these

523
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:30,669
would be conditions where there's a

524
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:33,159
hypersensitivity to life if you were

525
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:35,278
where there's pain where we don't

526
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:38,380
identify anything wrong with the tissue

527
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,950
there seems to be an overreaction and

528
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:44,470
you can't provide another explanation

529
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:47,669
and the three conditions that most

530
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:50,370
readily came to mind were migraine

531
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:53,409
irritable bowel syndrome and

532
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:55,569
fibromyalgia and what's interesting is

533
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:58,899
that these tend to occur in the same

534
00:25:55,569 --> 00:26:01,329
individuals a person may have one two or

535
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:03,638
all three of these conditions at some

536
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:06,009
point in their life they're all what are

537
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:07,689
called diagnosis of exclusion meaning

538
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:10,359
that we don't have blood tests or

539
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:13,149
diagnostic tests for them but if he fit

540
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,939
a clinical pattern on and we've ruled

541
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:20,558
out everything else that's what you call

542
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:24,669
it they all have a hypersensitivity of

543
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:27,700
this census producing pain but in the

544
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:29,669
case of migraine also sensitivity of the

545
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,190
eyes to light and the ears to sound

546
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:35,019
these are painful stimuli whereas to

547
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:39,548
someone else is just the normal

548
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:43,149
background so there's a great deal of

549
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:45,668
overlap going back to what you asked how

550
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:49,148
does this happen well there are certain

551
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:51,538
genetic tendencies are not genetically

552
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:54,849
inherited the way eye color is however

553
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:56,710
they also could be acquired a lot of

554
00:26:54,849 --> 00:27:00,009
people with irritable bowel syndrome

555
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:04,630
will develop the condition after they

556
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:07,480
have either had antibiotics or have had

557
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:12,970
some kind of infection like eating bad

558
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:15,370
clams and can go on and on and on with

559
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,220
fibromyalgia it often follows an injury

560
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:20,979
that fails to heal and develops in norm

561
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:24,759
or encompassing generalized pain

562
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:27,909
syndrome so there seems to be inciting

563
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:32,700
events and and certainly diet enters

564
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:35,890
into it again interestingly with

565
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,309
prebiotic and probiotic diet almost all

566
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:41,950
these conditions will improve on that

567
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:46,379
really depends on the degree to which

568
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:48,850
one adheres to that engages and other

569
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:53,170
lifestyle approaches that seem to

570
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:55,389
benefit the conditions now is there a

571
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,000
test one can get to see if they're

572
00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:00,160
deficient and endocannabinoids not

573
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,349
currently but we're working on that I

574
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,990
mean a lovely thing would be if we had a

575
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:08,589
non-invasive scheme of the scan of the

576
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:11,620
brain that would show us the density of

577
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:13,709
the receptors and their current level of

578
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:16,539
activities or we could measure

579
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,840
endocannabinoid levels without doing a

580
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:24,250
lumbar puncture a spinal tap but right

581
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:27,459
now no and there could be genetic tests

582
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:33,599
that would identify these issues we're

583
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:38,590
working on one such situation now to see

584
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:41,469
right yeah and another thing that a lot

585
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:44,319
of people talk about with using cannabis

586
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:48,029
is that the effects can vary widely

587
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:50,889
between different individuals is that

588
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:52,720
does that have to do with deficiencies

589
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,990
or different levels of endocannabinoids

590
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:00,490
yeah exactly again we're invoking this

591
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:03,880
hypothetical endocannabinoid tone so how

592
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:06,099
an individual will respond to a given

593
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,040
dose of cannabis will depend on their

594
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:11,579
prior experience of whether they have

595
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,710
tolerance if they've been a regular user

596
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:17,409
and it would be a function of the

597
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:21,759
numbers of cb1 receptors in the brain

598
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:23,950
whether they're active or inactive the

599
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,650
levels of endocannabinoids in the brain

600
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,750
and also the activity of the enzymes

601
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:33,460
that make those substances and break

602
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:36,910
them down so pretty complicated concept

603
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,650
and again we have either direct or

604
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,950
indirect proof of a lot of these

605
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:44,350
concepts but right now it's not a simple

606
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:47,350
thing where someone can go out and get

607
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:49,689
tested to see what their levels are on

608
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:53,378
the future yeah we'd hope for

609
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,730
that it would be very useful yeah one of

610
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:56,619
the things you keep coming back to you

611
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,139
and it sticks out in my mind because I'm

612
00:29:56,619 --> 00:30:02,018
a very active person I'm a runner you

613
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:04,599
keep talking about how activity can sort

614
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:06,308
of help modulate the endocannabinoid

615
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:08,528
system I was born if you talk a little

616
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:10,960
bit more about that oh sure well you

617
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:14,888
know this is a very topical issue right

618
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:18,639
now because for instance where I live

619
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:21,278
suddenly the gym is closed and the parks

620
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:26,288
are closed normally we take the dogs out

621
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:28,509
for a run every day and in addition to

622
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:31,929
the depression that people are having

623
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:34,750
because of kovat 19:00 they're going to

624
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:38,470
become chemically depressed without

625
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:40,569
their aerobic activity I hope you're not

626
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:44,110
experiencing that but everyone's going

627
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:47,859
to be at risk for this for shut-in for

628
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:51,189
long periods of time so I mean that

629
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:53,699
would be one example again this is a

630
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,259
situation where we have some human data

631
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,569
showing the relationship of aerobic

632
00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:01,649
exercise to increased under cannabinoid

633
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:06,069
levels there was one such study in

634
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:09,189
fibromyalgia just recently years ago

635
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:11,710
when I was in neurology practice I made

636
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,740
the statement which I hold to today on

637
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:19,120
that in fibromyalgia I've never seen

638
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:22,450
anyone who improved without the addition

639
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:26,888
of a low-impact aerobic activity program

640
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:30,429
to their regimen and I think the reason

641
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:35,079
is improvement and endocannabinoid

642
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:38,048
levels that's fascinating

643
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,199
so we're coming up to the end here and I

644
00:31:38,048 --> 00:31:42,970
did want to ask you you've been

645
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,340
researching cannabis medicine applying

646
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,889
cannabis medicine for so long now how

647
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:50,699
have attitudes among other health care

648
00:31:47,888 --> 00:31:53,558
providers sort of changed over the years

649
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,110
well there's been improvement we're

650
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:59,168
getting better acceptance at this point

651
00:31:56,109 --> 00:32:01,579
but the problem remains so we still have

652
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:04,130
vast prohibitions

653
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:07,879
active throughout a lot of the world

654
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:11,420
including this country and until er

655
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:14,810
unless those roadblocks to research and

656
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:18,140
wider availability of cannabis based

657
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:19,669
medicines occurs we're gonna have a

658
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,710
situation where there are a lot of

659
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:24,019
people out there that would benefit from

660
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:27,319
these types of treatments that just

661
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:29,509
don't have access at this time so no

662
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:32,720
matter how much things have changed or

663
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:37,730
improved there's vast potential for

664
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,860
