have you presenting at the event this

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,319
year both as part of the nursing panel

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,680
which is happening on Sunday evening

89
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,039
which is going to explore the role of

90
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,879
nurses in cannabis medicine and how

91
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,319
Brands can use their expertise When

92
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,798
developing new products uh but you'll

93
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,240
also be presenting a poster about a

94
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,918
nurse-led intervention that uses micro

95
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,840
doing psilocybin for treating cannabis

96
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,879
dependency which I know we're going to

97
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:34,279
get into a little bit later but first I

98
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:38,120
wanted to talk with you about the role

99
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:40,119
of nurses in cannabis so sort of what

100
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,000
does that role look like and how is how

101
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,879
has that changed since you first got

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,478
involved in cannabis

103
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,759
medicine yeah thank you for asking that

104
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:52,839
uh cannabis is

105
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:55,560
sorry nurses play h a really important

106
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,638
and pivotal role in cannabinoid medicine

107
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,519
we are essentially like the bridge

108
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,240
between patients who are interested in

109
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,120
cannabis therapies and the Cannabis

110
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,038
itself um you know there are there are

111
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,918
Physicians who are informed about it but

112
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,759
it's really like the nurses who are at

113
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,000
the bedside having like the important

114
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,080
conversations with patients like we are

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,439
that bridge that can provide the much

116
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,800
needed education and guidance that

117
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:28,399
patients need in navigating cannabis

118
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,038
therapies right and so how do patients

119
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,879
typically get connected with you yeah so

120
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,478
when patients find me they're typically

121
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:39,038
getting connected with me on social

122
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,879
media because I put a lot of educational

123
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,680
content and then they're like wait I

124
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,680
want to know more cannabis can help with

125
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,360
this tell tell me more how can it help

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
and then um and then I'll be like well

127
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,319
this is how it works in the body and

128
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,479
this is what you should look for and

129
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,639
this is like this is how you should like

130
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,120
try dosing um of course we're not

131
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,000
Physicians we're not giving

132
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,918
prescriptions we're not giving orders we

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,399
are educating them on how to

134
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,959
self-medicate right no in that education

135
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:13,279
piece in that guiding hand is so

136
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:16,038
important right I mean I can speak from

137
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,799
experience my my mom is actually having

138
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:20,360
issues with back pain recently um she's

139
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,759
doing physical therapy and things like

140
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,199
that nothing really seems to be working

141
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,759
and I was like maybe you should give

142
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,120
cannabis a try and then she's of course

143
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,560
the question is all right well what do I

144
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,519
try and I'm like well there are a lot of

145
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,280
options and again I'm not I mean I'm I'm

146
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,598
probably more educated than most people

147
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:41,159
but again I'm not a practitioner so

148
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:44,159
having someone um like a nurse who can

149
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,560
sort of help navigate would be very

150
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,319
helpful right right and that's that's

151
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,319
exactly what we do is we kind of we're

152
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,639
looking at the whole patient and like

153
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,000
their whole endoc canono system or ECS

154
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,960
and we're looking at how we can optimize

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,800
it with cannabis with CBD and other

156
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:06,159
canono as well as other interventions so

157
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,879
that's kind of what sets us apart from

158
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,680
like Bud tenders is who can make the

159
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,319
Cannabis recommendations but we're also

160
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,199
looking at their entire ECS and their

161
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,479
whole system and their medications and

162
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,360
how can we help you optimize all of

163
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:24,000
those things um in addition to trying

164
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,520
cannabis and now are are more and more

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,879
nurses sort of getting interested in

166
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,799
learning more about cannabis medicine

167
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,840
yeah definitely I think that nurses are

168
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,520
first of all like burnt out from working

169
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,878
the bedside um I was one of those nurses

170
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,240
that definitely got burnt out and then

171
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,520
they're seeing that you know

172
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,879
interventions at the bedside for chronic

173
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,918
illness just aren't just aren't doing it

174
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,360
patients are just being put on more and

175
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,478
more medications and they're not working

176
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,479
the patients are still suffering but

177
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,079
what are things that we can try that may

178
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,878
have better outcomes with fewer side

179
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,878
effects and that's where plant medicine

180
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,960
can play a really pivotal

181
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:13,080
role excellent and now I know just just

182
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,198
this last fall the Ana officially

183
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,519
recognized cannabis nursing as a

184
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,199
specialty so how important was

185
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:24,198
that I think that this is I don't think

186
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,800
we have yet come to terms with like the

187
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,560
the gravity of that because what that

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,479
means this is the first you know health

189
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:37,839
Care Organization Association that has

190
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,000
recognized you know cannabis as the

191
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,719
medicine that it is so that means that

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,919
it that we could just start treating

193
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,519
cannabis as the real medicine that it is

194
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:51,079
you know the the the medical the the

195
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,919
physicians organization the pharmacist

196
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,480
organizations they haven't come out and

197
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,559
named their own Specialties yet in

198
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,120
cannabis and nursing is the first one to

199
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:03,319
do that so that means that that we're

200
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,399
well on our way to treating and

201
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,240
recognize recognizing cannabis as as a

202
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,639
true

203
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,039
therapeutic so and I'm sure you're you

204
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,600
there has to be a little bit of Pride

205
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,000
there that you're that your profession

206
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,720
was the first to recognize that

207
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,200
absolutely yeah yeah it's really

208
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,720
exciting and you know nursing is going

209
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,040
on 20 I think it's 20 plus years of

210
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,839
being the most trusted profession in the

211
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,879
country so the fact that nurses are

212
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,920
cannabis nurses are being officially

213
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,759
recognized is really huge and I think

214
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,799
that more that means that more people

215
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,799
who are scared to try cannabis are going

216
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:46,599
to find that that hand to hold them in a

217
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,000
nurse and guide them right because trust

218
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,720
really is important with cannabis

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,039
medicine because it's uh it's a bit of a

220
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,240
journey and there's trial and error and

221
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,480
there's um some experiment

222
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,079
experimentation that goes on so that

223
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,639
trust is very important yeah

224
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:06,278
for sure excellent excellent um talk a

225
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,958

00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:13,518
who's on it and what can we expect yeah

228
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,680
I'm really really excited for this panel

229
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,759
um in past events that I've gone to at

230
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,120

232
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,679
bring this mainstream how do we get this

233
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,360
information to the people in a trusted

234
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,639

diverse roles in the Cannabis space

251
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,120

excited about it too um all right so

256
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:28,000
shifting gears a little bit here to talk

257
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,919
about um the poster that you're going to

258
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,559
be presenting um the it's about uh using

259
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:37,078
psilocybin to treat cannabis dependency

260
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:39,078
so um talk talk with me a bit about sort

261
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,799
of the Genesis of this um how did you

262
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:44,679
first get interested in studying this

263
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,679
yeah so the poster we're doing is from a

264
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,319
project that we did in the fall we

265
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,078
wanted to see if micro doing psilocybin

266
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,278
can help people who struggle with

267
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:56,120
cannabis dependency and I know people in

268
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,600
the industry are like say that cannabis

269
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,159
does not have any problems you know it's

270
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,240
100% safe but on our side in helping our

271
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,319
patients we come across a lot of people

272
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,320
who have an unhealthy relationship with

273
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,079
the plant and I started we started

274
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,879
offering micro doing um as part of our

275
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,078
business back in May and in doing that

276
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,838
we had patients report that they were

277
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:23,159
like inadvertently decreasing their

278
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,519
cannabis use um alongside alcohol we see

279
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,399
that oftentimes and that's well

280
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,679
researched too um but the decrease in

281
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,240
cannabis is not well researched so we're

282
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,519
like could micro doing help people

283
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,039
improve their relationship with the

284
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,799
plant and depend on it less the same way

285
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,838
that we see other you know sub other

286
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,559
substance

287
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,680
addictions so we kind of put it out

288
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:49,359
there like let's let's get a group of

289
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,319
eight people and let's try this out so

290
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,360
that's what we did we found eight people

291
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,278
who were willing to try um this group

292
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,440
program that we had put together and it

293
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:05,439
was an six week six week program um

294
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,839
where we use micro doing group support

295
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,079
um we met every week we took a group

296
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,519
tolerance break together we provided a

297
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:16,838
ton of Education we even did a mini dose

298
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,759
session um where people got to they

299
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,000
could consume up to two grams of

300
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,519
psilocybin during that session um and

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,440
then we had a group chat as well during

302
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,360
that time and the the results were

303
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,279
astounding it was amazing to see

304
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,240
so you were already using psilocybin

305
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:38,039
micro doing to treat um different

306
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,560
conditions and sort of just saw the

307
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:44,958
reduction in cannabis as a a welcome

308
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:46,599
side effect yeah yeah exactly then

309
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,479
that's what we were seeing like being

310
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:53,480
reported and then alongside of that we

311
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,480
have people coming to us um saying like

312
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,519
I have I'm using all this cannabis how

313
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,278
can I cut down um so we just wanted to

314
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,639
see if this could be an effective tool

315
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,519
of course not not a cure or anything

316
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,440
like that but a tool for people to use

317
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,839
right and now when you say an unhealthy

318
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,160
relationship with cannabis what does

319
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,839
that look like um in the people who are

320
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:20,519
in the group it looked like uh they

321
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,800
could not get through the day without

322
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,720
you know without sucking on their bait

323
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:29,159
pen multiple times a day it looked like

324
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,199
people could not travel because they

325
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:34,078
could they feared that they wouldn't

326
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:36,278
have access to their cannabis um it

327
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,799
looked like the slightest

328
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:42,159
inconvenience would make them turn to

329
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:45,479
their Bak pin um and it was people who

330
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:47,278
were just not they wanted a different

331
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,079
relationship they didn't want to have to

332
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:53,519
depend on it so much to help them feel

333
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:57,120
normal and then so there was one person

334
00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:00,720
who was showing early signs of CHS she

335
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,799
had like early morning nausea um

336
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,440
so no CHS interesting topic we actually

337
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:11,039
just spoke with um Ethan Russo who did a

338
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,880
study on CHS uh all about that so yeah

339
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,159
that that just seems awful yeah and

340
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,559
we're seeing a lot of that now I'm

341
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:19,480
working with some other um Professionals

342
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,559
in the space and we're doing our own

343
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,720
survey

344
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:29,838
also oh interesting yeah interesting um

345
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,639
so what methods of support are available

346
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,880
were available for cannabis um overc

347
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,440
consumption or cannabis dependency um

348
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,600
kind of before you explored this and how

349
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,040
does that differ from or how does that

350
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,319
compare to you know alcohol or tobacco

351
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:48,838
sort of um right well understood

352
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:51,759
dependencies there is there does exist

353
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,720
like you know Marijuana anonymous groups

354
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,440
I haven't like been to those so I don't

355
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,680
know a whole lot about them I assume

356
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,759
that they follow like the same 12ep

357
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:04,399
program Maybe alcoholics annonymous does

358
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,318
um there are there are some Facebook

359
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,759
groups but a lot of times it's like a

360
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:13,159
silent people suffer in silence a lot

361
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,360
and they're afraid to admit that their

362
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:18,519
cannabis use is problematic because they

363
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,600
have all these people saying cannabis is

364
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,839
this amazing wonderful medicine and

365
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,560
wonderful drug and like shame on you for

366
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,440
having a problem with it it's not

367
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,719
addictive which is all completely wrong

368
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,839
so then they're just kind of like

369
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,879
suffering in the shadows so there's not

370
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,319
a whole lot of support out there yeah no

371
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,078
and you know it's it's an important

372
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:40,958
point that you can have an unhealthy

373
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:42,318
relationship with just about anything

374
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,479
right even things that are good for you

375
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,360
like

376
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,319
exercise absolutely yeah

377
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,318
definitely um so what is it about

378
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:53,479
psilocybin that makes it helpful for for

379
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,519
addressing uh issues like this yeah so

380
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,000
what we have found and what the research

381
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:03,399
supports with psilocybin is that it can

382
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,959
one like quiet quiet the brain chatter

383
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,838
you know the stories that we're telling

384
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,439
ourselves like I can't I can't be in the

385
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,038
room with this person because they're

386
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,038
going to say this and it just kind of

387
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,480
like quiets that down so people aren't

388
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,119
feeling the need to escape certain

389
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,120
situations because that brain chatter

390
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,918
has quieted down um and it can widen the

391
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,318
window of tolerance for people and their

392
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:29,000
anxiety so things that used to make them

393
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:31,519
anxious and turn to their vape pen um no

394
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,558
longer has that effect or has less of

395
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:38,119
that effect you know one example could

396
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,079
be people who who have road rage and you

397
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,439
know the the smallest thing on the road

398
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,439
could set them off but Micro doing can

399
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,720
kind of help like oh this person cut me

400
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,320
off but it's not that big of a deal like

401
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,038
I'm just going to continue on my way it

402
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,159
helps things like roll off people's

403
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:56,440
shoulders more so they're not turning to

404
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,880
cannabis to num out from that right so I

405
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,080
guess that's an important thing so it

406
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,679
sounds like it's it's more of a

407
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:06,240
psychological dependency than a physical

408
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:10,400
dependency on cannabis fair to say uh

409
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,440
fair but also because you know the ECS

410
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,640
and the way that our receptors work if

411
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,640
the receptors are used to getting all of

412
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:22,840
this THC then all you pull away the THC

413
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,679
of course there are withdrawal symptoms

414
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:27,399
that that come with it sorry my lights

415
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,240
turned off right

416
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,360
there um so yeah and there all there are

417
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,480
withdrawal symptoms and then we kind of

418
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,038
like help people like manage those

419
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,599
things

420
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:41,000
um micro doin can be a great tool for

421
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,599
that um magnesium glycinate can be a

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,359
great thing to help calm the nerves and

423
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,839
the irritability that people feel from

424
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,959
the withdraw so it is it is both I think

425
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:51,038
it's highly

426
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,798
psychological um but it is also a little

427
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,839
bit physical yeah so is irritability

428
00:18:53,798 --> 00:19:00,679
sort of the main side effect there from

429
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:03,119
um withdrawal with girls yeah yeah and

430
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,759
that's what um I just did a recent poll

431
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,678
on um on my Instagram to see what

432
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,319
withdrawal symptoms people are feeling

433
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,720
and I think it was like 80% and it was

434
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:16,079
just 100 people but um but 80 of them

435
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,038
said that irritability and anxiety were

436
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:22,079
a major withdrawal symptom so helping

437
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,960
people to manage that in different ways

438
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,720
teaching them how the ECS works and how

439
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,640
maybe like getting out and doing some

440
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,519
exercise or going doing pleasurable

441
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,919
activity can help them get into balance

442
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,400
so they don't have to use their bit pen

443
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,679
excellent now I know Megan you had

444
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,600
shared a number of slides uh with

445
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,480
different graphs that were kind of

446
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,119
showing the results of this U this trial

447
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,038
uh so I'd like to walk through those and

448
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,079
I can you know as as we're talking about

449
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,960
it I'll kind of use some magic of

450
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,439
editing to superimpose them here so the

451
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,519
folks who are watching on YouTube can

452
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,200
see that um so

453
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,519
I don't know if you want to pull it up

454
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,360
and um where the best place to start

455
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:09,400
would

456
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:11,879
be um we could start with the um let's

457
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,120
see here slide number nine is the cudit

458
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,240
score right so the the cudit is the

459
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:21,959
cannabis use disorder identification

460
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:24,679
tool so you know in the DSM cannabis use

461
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,440
disorder we have really crappy

462
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,360
diagnostics for that you know people who

463
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,320
use more than four times a week they

464
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,359
have to to check the box but we know

465
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,240
that not everybody who uses four times a

466
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:39,079
week or more has cannabis use disorder

467
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,279
but we wanted a validated study tool to

468
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:44,639
just measure it so what we're looking at

469
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:48,119
on this graph the yellow is like the

470
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,360
scores um pre the program and then the

471
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:54,519
pink were the scores post the program so

472
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:55,359
the average score went from 30.25 down

473
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,038
to

474
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,240
20.8 so that basically just means that

475
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,158
like they're use from the beginning of

476
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,599
the program to the end of the program

477
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,679
was cut from the that cannabis use

478
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,480
disorder tool and I'd like to start by

479
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,679
saying like back up and say like this is

480
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,240
not an IRB approved study or anything

481
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,320
like that this is just a program that we

482
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,159
did and we collected data excellent

483
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,278
excellent now am I reading this right

484
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,080
where one of them actually went

485
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:25,960
up that that one did and I think that

486
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:29,119
one was an outlier that like because of

487
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,000
the scoring itself

488
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,319
that maybe it didn't actually reflect

489
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,359
what was going on with that that group

490
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,519
member because everybody's use went down

491
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:43,278
but the way that the scoring is on those

492
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:45,200
questionnaires is doesn't reflect real

493
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:47,640
world yeah like you said a little

494
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,400
problematic if just four times a week is

495
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,480
is is Right problem yes okay excellent

496
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,960
and know and and maybe to step back here

497
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,200
a little bit too so I know you kind of

498
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,720
briefly touched on it but so

499
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,759
explain a bit what the weekly sessions

500
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,319
are like now are these sort of like um

501
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,278
are people micro doing and then you're

502
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,599
talking them through that or is it more

503
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:12,480
that they're they're micro doing

504
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,918
privately and then kind of reporting

505
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,360
their experience how does what does that

506
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,640
look like yeah uh great question so how

507
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:22,719
it worked was you know we held like our

508
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,640
group meetings um on week one everybody

509
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,200
met together we kind of went through

510
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,038
like the different protocols that they

511
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,600
can kind of choose from

512
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,319
so it is very much a Choose Your Own

513
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,519
Adventure we are not prescribing or

514
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,000
telling them exactly what to take and

515
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,918
how much and but we're saying you may

516
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,359
want to start at a low dose just like

517
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,278
with cannabis and then see how you feel

518
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,199
with that see if you need a little bit

519
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,319
larger dose or smaller dose um and then

520
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,480
just kind of go according to how you

521
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,480
feel and how it makes you feel and then

522
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,079
on week two everybody started the

523
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,240
tolerance break together so every stop

524
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,038
their use Monday Tuesday Wednesday we

525
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,440
met all three of those days

526
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,359
and during the meetings people were

527
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,519
sharing you know how they felt um they

528
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,639
were sharing their struggles um so it

529
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,798
it's very much a shared experience and

530
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,640
we had a group chat this whole time as

531
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:14,480
well that people could share their

532
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,799
experiences which was a phenomenal

533
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,720
support system for them um and then the

534
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,879
rest of the weeks we met once each week

535
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,880
and we had the group chat going

536
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,760
throughout and then people also like

537
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,520
shared we provided education on like

538
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,278
other cannaboids so many people don't

539
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,558
know the benefits of the other canabo

540
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:33,038
that they can use to manage their

541
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,918
symptoms that don't involve THC so we

542
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,038
provide that education and then we met

543
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,480
on a weekly basis and people just

544
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,640
basically share their

545
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,360
experience and so that tolerance break

546
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,559
that week two tolerance break that's

547
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,798
that's from Cannabis correct that's kind

548
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,558
of taking a weekl long break from

549
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:51,480
Cannabis so I could imagine for a lot of

550
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,240
these patients like how long had it been

551
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,440
since they had taken that much time off

552
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,200
from using

553
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,000
cannabis um some of them have never

554
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,440
taken time off

555
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,119
um and some of them have tried in the

556
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,519
past and they couldn't get through it by

557
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,959
themselves so like the the group support

558
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,200
and group accountability right uh really

559
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,679
played a key

560
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,919
role yeah and how did it affect their

561
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,240
sensitivity once they kind of return to

562
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,759
it the week after

563
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,200
that um so they could return if they

564
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,960
wanted some people didn't didn't want to

565
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,558
return at all um they just wanted to

566
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,798
quit for good um but some of them that

567
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,278
did return were like wow I like I smoked

568
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,480
before I went to the grocery store and I

569
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:36,679
actually felt High it has been months or

570
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,640
years since I actually felt high so

571
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,720
they're like this is that that was

572
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,080
really pivotal for them also to to be

573
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,679
able to feel that because so many people

574
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,480
use and they don't feel high anymore wow

575
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,000
yeah no and I know that's one thing that

576
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,480
um Dr sulak talks about a lot with um

577
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,839
with his patients is trying to schedule

578
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,599
in um Regular tolerance breaks uh for

579
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,678
that reason that it can kind of reset

580
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,918
your receptors and um kind of increase

581
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,640
your

582
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,559
sensitivity yeah yeah absolutely and

583
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,000
especially with cannabis um prices being

584
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:09,798
what they are um being able to use less

585
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,919
to get the desired effect is always a

586
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:16,200
good thing right right and the the THC

587
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:18,240
potency you know our endoc canabo system

588
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:23,200
I believe was not meant to be blasted

589
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:26,240
with 90% distillate multiple times a day

590
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,960
I think that that's um a so somewhat

591
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,399
unnatural way to consume so and that's

592
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:36,759
what that's what's making people sick in

593
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:39,719
the long run a lot of times so right all

594
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:43,278
right uh should we look at another graph

595
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,079
yeah yeah so then next up on uh page 10

596
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,319
here is our measured general anxiety

597
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,759
disorder scale scale this is also a

598
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:55,200
validated tool um so the yellow is each

599
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:57,919
member before the group and then the

600
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:02,558
pink was at the end of the group so the

601
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:05,278
me score went from 11.9 down to 5.9 um

602
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,639
so everybody's anxiety decreased as

603
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,079
their cannabis use decreased and we do

604
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,120
see you know people who consume high

605
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,720
amounts of THC on a regular basis

606
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,839
oftentimes have

607
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,519
anxiety I believe it and it's like a

608
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,918
chicken or the egg thing but it there is

609
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,759
Sometimes They Come

610
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:29,080
Together excellent yeah that's pretty

611
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,960
significant yeah yeah um and then the

612
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,240
most important thing you know cannabis

613
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,720
use is really hard I'm looking at um

614
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,919
graph 12 here cannabis use is hard to

615
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,839
quantify because everybody's use

616
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:45,480
patterns are so different so what we did

617
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,519
uh with graph on page 12 here was we

618
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,480
just we just asked people what their use

619
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,079
patterns were before and at the end of

620
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,240
the group and I think this is the most

621
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,119
important one because you can really see

622
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,440
how people changed you know they went

623
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:03,359
from four to six joints day down to 1 to

624
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,600
two so that was like cut by 30% um 6 to

625
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:09,879
eight dabs plus flow throughout the day

626
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,719
to only flower at night um number three

627
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,520
was the one who that one had early signs

628
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,880
of CHS you know 50 to 70 milligrams a

629
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:21,119
day in concentrates Edibles I think she

630
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,200
was also using FICO or RSO and then down

631
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,678
to just you know a couple of inhalations

632
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,880
a day um and then people were using high

633
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,120
doses of edibles also and then went down

634
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,799
to just a couple of

635
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:35,599
milligrams so this is my favorite one

636
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:38,879
because you can actually see the human

637
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,959
element and how each person's um use

638
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,919
patterns

639
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,558
changed right no and I think that um you

640
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,840
know in a lot of cases you know cold

641
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:53,240
turkey is not always the best way to go

642
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:55,000
about um stopping um a bad habit so

643
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,919
seeing a reduction and then you know

644
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,640
continuing that until eventually you get

645
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:02,559
to zero um

646
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,480
is probably a more sustainable way to

647
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:09,000
right right yeah and our goal wasn't to

648
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,399
get people to like quit all together um

649
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,519
you know the goal was to help them

650
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:16,518
reframe their relationship and bring

651
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,558
awareness to their use because a lot of

652
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:21,480
people just use and don't even think

653
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,839
about it they don't know their why um so

654
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,360
just bringing awareness that okay you're

655
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,918
using this valid medicine why are you

656
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:31,359
using it what is it doing for you can we

657
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,799
use a lower dose or other cannabinoids

658
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,759
to achieve that same effect yeah and

659
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,038
that's a great point I mean because we

660
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,278
know that cannabis is beneficial so we

661
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:41,919
do want them to continue using it and

662
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:44,919
just make sure that it's in a beneficial

663
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,679
way right yeah yep for whatever that

664
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:49,720
looks like for that person because of

665
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:51,559
course everybody of course of

666
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,000
course and

667
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:57,480
so I'm curious so the micro doing of

668
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,319
psilocybin is that something that would

669
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,679
be expect to be done sort of in

670
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,038
perpetuity or is it just to kind of get

671
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:07,600
a reset and then um you can go from

672
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,278
there like how does that work so the

673
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,558
micro doing

674
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:15,839
was to help

675
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:18,558
people how do I explain this it was used

676
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,879
to to help decrease anxiety to help

677
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,200
bring

678
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,799
awareness to people's thought patterns

679
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,720
and the reasons why they were using

680
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:31,960
cannabis in the first place um a lot of

681
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,839
people I think like maybe six or seven

682
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:39,840
out of eight of them were using cannabis

683
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:42,158
to manage symptoms of previous trauma or

684
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,798
high stress situations right and we see

685
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,000
that in addiction addiction is not about

686
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,679
the substance itself it's about the

687
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,679
usually the trauma that people are

688
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:55,000
running from um so this was to help

689
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,360
bring awareness to that and help

690
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,519
people realize that they can actually

691
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:03,079
get through what whatever situation it

692
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,839
is without having to turn to THC to help

693
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:07,398
them get through that situation right so

694
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,918
this isn't a situation of just kind of

695
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:12,839
trading one substance for another right

696
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,679
it's right right this is like a tool

697
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:17,278
that people can use to bring awareness

698
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,480
to their thought patterns and their use

699
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:23,398
patterns and maybe shift things you know

700
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,319
cybin increases neuroplasticity in the

701
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:29,479
brain so if you have this this track in

702
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:32,119
your brain that says okay when I go into

703
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,399
this staff meeting it's going to be high

704
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:37,119
stress so I need to use my vape before I

705
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:39,079
go into the staff meeting but so asyan

706
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,798
can be like maybe I

707
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:44,398
don't maybe I don't maybe it won't be

708
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:46,480
that high stress I'm feeling calm now

709
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,158
maybe I don't need it so then they don't

710
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,079
use it and go into that staff meeting

711
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,399
and things turn out fine and then that

712
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:56,359
kind of like solidifies into this you

713
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:58,959
know neuroplasticity helps solidify that

714
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:01,240
path in the brain so then they don't

715
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,480
need it to go into future

716
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,798
meetings yeah no and that's I mean it's

717
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,120
really something that's incredible about

718
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:10,558
Sil ayin hear about these other studies

719
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:13,038
too with you know PTSD and and things

720
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,480
like that you know having one or two of

721
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:18,480
those guided sessions um can sort of

722
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,000
really help people and and again it's

723
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,558
not something that like oh I need to

724
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,359
take this every day it's more of like

725
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,918
you know you have that realization it

726
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:30,959
creates a new pathway and um I'm not say

727
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,600
saying you're cured but uh it seems that

728
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,798
way right right and it's yeah we don't

729
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:40,918
say cure we say it's like an effective

730
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:43,158
tool to help great I like that right

731
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:47,720
cool um more graphs

732
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:52,360
please okay what else do we have we have

733
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:55,278
um we have like you know this was a paid

734
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:58,079
program people paid 399 bucks to be to

735
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:01,240
be part of this program um they

736
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:04,439
definitely got more value than just 400

737
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,038
bucks um I I forgot to say that we sent

738
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,759
them um you know magnesium glycinate we

739
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:12,519
sent them an allnatural sleep supplement

740
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,278
and we sent them some of our CBG cbga

741
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:18,319
formulation because of how CBG works in

742
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:21,159
the body um so that was included in this

743
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:23,480
and everybody says oh I don't I don't

744
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:27,440
want to pay money to help me take a tea

745
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,558
bre but this is how the program kind of

746
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,320
paid for itself for some people I'm

747
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:34,119
looking at slide number 13 and this is

748
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,319
how you know the the amount that people

749
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,479
spent prior to the program and then at

750
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,519
the end of the program so um the average

751
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,120
monthly spend was

752
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:48,038
321 at the beginning and then at the end

753
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:50,759
of the program it dropped down to 122 um

754
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:53,480
so a lot of people are spending hundreds

755
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,278
of dollars a month on their weed and

756
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,720
then by the end of the program you know

757
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:57,759
they realized that they didn't use it

758
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,278
that much so of course they're not going

759
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,038
to going to spend that much on it yeah

760
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:04,759
no and it goes back to the point we said

761
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:07,440
before you know cannabis is expensive um

762
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:10,200
especially when compared to alcohol and

763
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,919
some of these other um substances that

764
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,600
have been around for a long time so

765
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,799
being able to reduce that um helps the

766
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:19,839
helps the pocketbook too yeah yeah

767
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:21,519
absolutely so that's something that we

768
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:24,439
that we thought was important to measure

769
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,079
in you know how much people are spending

770
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,278
excellent so so where do you go from

771
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,000
here um is this something program that

772
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:32,359
you're you're hoping to start offering

773
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,679
um more

774
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:37,158
widely yeah this is where it gets

775
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,200
interesting when we started the program

776
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,960
we made it very clear that we we're not

777
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,360
sure if this is going to work we want to

778
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,079
see if this will work okay we're

779
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,719
charging 400 bucks for this this program

780
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,319
we're looking for eight people to try

781
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,880
and test this out and we had we were

782
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,638
able to fill it with eight people I

783
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,240
think we had a couple extra too that um

784
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:59,599
that we had to turn away because we were

785
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,480
full and then we had the results and

786
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,199
then we're like promoting the results

787
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,679
and showing all the cool things this

788
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:10,599
program did and then we had a really

789
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,000
hard time filling the next cohort and

790
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,119
we're not sure if it was a timing thing

791
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,480
we had it we originally had it starting

792
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,320
in January um but we're like okay people

793
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,639
aren't spending money on themselves in

794
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,280
December so let's push it to February um

795
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,240
and then we promoted it like as hard and

796
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,040
as best as we could like showing this

797
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,918
awesome data showing patient

798
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:34,279
testimonials um but there was just not

799
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,440
interest in it and we're not sure if it

800
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,839
was the cost of the program or what but

801
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,079
um but we know people struggle and we

802
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,199
have this awesome thing available so

803
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,720
that's where that's where it got

804
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:49,118
interesting that once we're we were sure

805
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:51,719
about the results people weren't

806
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,838
interested that is well that's unfort

807
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,158
isn't that fascinating it is um well

808
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,358
hopefully we'll we'll put a link in the

809
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,559
show description here I hope police so

810
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:01,880
that if anyone listening or watching is

811
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,880
interested they can get in touch with

812
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,880
you um but yeah of course and so now we

813
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,280
offer like groups are are hard to fill

814
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,720
and hard to manage um you know because

815
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,640
it's a group you're trying to get all

816
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:17,639
these people on the same page and in the

817
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:20,400
T same meeting in the same time zone

818
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:23,440
that could also be you know a factor um

819
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,079
so we do offer one-on-one support now

820
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,480
for people like we're offering the same

821

844
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,440
excited this is will be this will be my

845
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:31,639
third year at canmed and it was the

846
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,599
first Cannabis Conference that I went to

847
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:37,039
two years ago in Pasadena I think I like

848
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,200
booked it like the week before or

849
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,519
something it was like the last minute

850
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:42,960
thing because I just live half an hour

851
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:45,000
away and um that was the best

852
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,318
decision

853
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,358
I and the amount that I learn and the

854
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:52,079
connections that I made at that

855
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:54,598
conference and then going to Florida

856
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,240
last year was amazing the food was

857
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,838
amazing and then like because it's a

858
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:04,078
small conference it's easier and

859
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:06,599
more um a more intimate space to really

860
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,880
