00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,399
leading the capital markets Workshop uh

90
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,280
it's a halfday affair where we talk

91
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,839
every about everything involved in

92
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,399
investing in cannaboid Innovation uh we

93
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,918
had a great respon last year I think

94
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,679
people got a lot of great value out of

95
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,959
it so I think everyone's really excited

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,120
to have you back again for Kim at 24 so

97
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,198
before we kind of dive into what folks

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,360
can expect at the capital markets

99
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,120
Workshop I want to give you the

100
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,120
opportunity to kind of talk a bit about

101
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,439
your background and why you're excited

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,840
to join us at CID sure thanks Ben and uh

103
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,719
I think the one thing to start off with

104
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,879
is yeah we've been one of our things

105
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,600
we've just been lucky uh to be where

106
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,079
we're at because it's hard to predict

107
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,039
where cannabis is going uh and again I

108
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:04,519
can talk here in a sec about how we

109
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,199
consider cannabis and break that down uh

110
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,038
but the reason why I say we're lucky

111
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,360
because you know last year we we jumped

112
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,800
into the you know organizing the capital

113
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,080
markets Workshop it was the first time

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,520
you guys had done it uh we thought it

115
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:21,758
was important to uh you know uh to

116
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,680
compete effectively with our other you

117
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,360
know big larger investment Banks and we

118
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,120
thought that was an important event to

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,160
be a part of and so my background just

120
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,560
fits well into that I have two undergrad

121
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,919
degrees in science got into biotech 15

122
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,519
years of operational experience in

123
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,680
biotech companies and then uh jumped

124
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,639
into Investment Banking

125
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,519
2005 uh and did biotech deals in San

126
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,400
Francisco Ben and then came back to

127
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,839
Colorado where I'm from in 2009 I was

128
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,159
leading a life science group a group

129
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,959
called Headwaters and found golden legle

130
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,560
Partners in 2012 and that's when

131
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,000
Colorado and Washington legalized adult

132
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,759
use right so uh we looked at it and we

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,038
consider cannabis to be very similar to

134
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,520
biotech and that's why we jumped in and

135
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,318
so we've done a number of deals 27 28

136
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,399
deals I think in the space uh we've had

137
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,360
cannabis clients on six of the seven

138
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,879
continents uh we've been doing a 10

139
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,759
years actually come uh last over 10

140
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,680
years uh we got into it December 2013

141
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,520
but we've also been doing it uh eight

142
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,360
years come this month our first Israeli

143
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,478
client was January

144
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,520
2016 so uh certainly we are the first

145
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,279
Investment Bank in the US to do cannabis

146
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,799
and again we're lucky to be where we're

147
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,598
at because the industry is just kind of

148
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,240
moving towards kind of the science and

149
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,959
the biotech and that's why we want to be

150
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,439
a part of canmed last year excellent no

151
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,198
and you mentioned that sort of cannabis

152
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,639
seemed like a natural fit coming from

153
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,919
biotech explain a bit about you know

154
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,720
what what the similarities are

155
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,879
there uh yeah well there's there's some

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,720
similarities some not but this also gets

157
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,560
to what we just mentioned to you uh

158
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,039
before we joined on this Ben that you

159
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,598
know we uh coming from a you know having

160
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,399
a biochemistry background one of the

161
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:06,478
things that you learn when you're in

162
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,279
chemistry class that they've started I

163
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,000
think in the late 1800s to come up with

164
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,878
a consistent nomenclature with all these

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,959
weird

166
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,879
molecules and uh this gets also to the

167
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,159
DA rescheduling issue but before we go

168
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,240
there I mean that's one thing we wanted

169
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,599
to kind of make a more better more

170
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,319
consistent nomenclature and so we

171
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,639
believe instead of saying marijuana is

172
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,560
cannabis or cannabis is marijuana and

173
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,759
you know can cannabinoids cannaboids you

174
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,360
know potato potato it's been kind of a

175
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,160
mess over the last 15 years yeah uh we

176
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,120
believe cannabis you know is it is the

177
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,759
genus and so we break it down pretty

178
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,399
easily to two sectors THC plus which is

179
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:47,639
you know delta8 Delta 9 Delta 10 thca

180
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,758
thcv and then you have the THC minus

181
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,478
which is a lot of people call hemp right

182
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,080
which you know you have the molecular

183
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,199
side and then you have the industrial

184
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:57,878
side and then you can have you know the

185
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,598
molecular side is flavonoids tpin so you

186
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,158
can really kind of uh if you really look

187
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,360
at the cannabis plant you know

188
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:05,959
flavonoids aren't in aren't just in

189
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,680
cannabis and in other plants but I think

190
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,478
if you set the table that way it makes

191
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,000
discussions uh much more simplistic but

192
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:17,399
you know looking at the as I mentioned

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,240
in the very beginning we saw this uh

194
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:20,560
cannabis is very similar to biotech if

195
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:26,240
you really break it down at least the

196
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:29,478
way way we saw it in 20 12 2013 is that

197
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,839
you know cannabis was is highly regular

198
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:34,319
ated it's a biological supply chain and

199
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,680
when you get down to

200
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,320
it uh you know it is a

201
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:44,679
drug right so that in itself I think is

202
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,760
is uh kind of the most most simpli

203
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,759
simple fact about but I think getting

204
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,639
into the other thing that we see the

205
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,240
importance of you know certainly camad

206
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,000
in biotech in

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,919
2024 is the fact that we we think that

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,278
we what we have Ben is the uh this what

209
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,199
we call call the three spokes is you

210
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,240
have all these amazing molecules as we

211
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,879
mentioned a lot of these different

212
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,000
molecules emanating from the cannabis

213
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,480
plant you have a lot of these

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,480
indications or diseases that need better

215
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,920
treatments and then you have each

216
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,839
individual has kind of a different

217
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,559
genetic makeup or they metabolize things

218
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,120
differently and that itself in the whole

219
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:22,719
thing scheme of things is a is a big

220
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,240
experiment a lot of experiments right

221
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,440
and so our our whole goal is to help

222
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,759
companies we're investment bankers right

223
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,200
so our goal is to help really good

224
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,679
companies that are trying to find

225
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,278
solutions to to provide data to solve

226
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,639
that big puzzle uh and find them very

227
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,399
good Capital so that kind of breaks it

228
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,360
down what we do and why we think

229
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,759
cannabis and biotech are similar yeah

230
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,079
excellent no and it's a great point that

231
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,240
you make there are so many different

232
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:52,078
compounds that are have potential for so

233
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
many different indications and then on

234
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:55,159
top of that you have the whole idea of

235
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,160
the Entourage effect where there is

236
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:01,679
multiple different compounds working to

237
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:04,039
kind of service those those targets too

238
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,159
so yeah it is it's a big project and

239
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,599
it's going to take a a lot of a lot of

240
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,399
smart people which is why we try to

241
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,959
bring them together I can man exactly no

242
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,240
that's and that's why we want to be

243
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:17,759
involved right excellent now so let's

244
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,360
talk a bit about the capital markets

245
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,679
workshop and kind of what you what you

246
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,800
have planned there so what can attendees

247
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,799
expect uh from the

248
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:32,399
workshop uh not much it's gonna be the

249
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:36,000
same it's a no uh well it's uh what

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,159
we're trying to do is well the the well

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,200
let's get back to the real Genesis is I

252
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,559
remember when I was talking to

253
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,879
Brendan and heard about camed for the

254
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,759
first time and thought well you know

255
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,480
it'd be good for to be a part of that

256
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,200
for the all the reasons we just talked

257
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,480
about but you know be in the previous

258
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,959
incarnations you know canmed was really

259
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,200
all about science which it should be but

260
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,638
you know the other thing is if you

261
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,560
practice you know and look in science

262
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,440
and biotech you realize that you know

263
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,119
it's innovation's not cheap it's

264
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,680
expensive so capital's always a big part

265
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,799
of this and since innovation's now

266
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,799
becoming more important part of cannabis

267
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,679
you know we you know that was proa

268
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,278
finally included in the agenda last year

269
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,838
uh we were lucky enough to beat out C

270
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:20,679
and steel to be the the main sponsor of

271
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,639
the event last year and that's like you

272
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,759
know last year we essentially did the

273
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,399
first event and you know the cool thing

274
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,240
about it was we pretty much put the

275
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,679
whole program together we had nine

276
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
panels

277
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,479
uh we essentially tried our best to put

278
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,720
the best and brightest but also men

279
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,159
women including more women uh because

280
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,480
they're not frankly included enough in a

281
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,039
lot of these panels whether it's

282
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,959
science-based or not in cannabis and so

283
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,559
the original idea was to kind of come

284
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,199
together with a lot of the the topics

285
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,799
that are important and again going back

286
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,320
to biotech Ben trying to kind of

287
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,879
replicate and say okay what are some of

288
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,800
the issues that have been important that

289
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:01,200
i' I've known about since being a part

290
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:05,039
of the biotech community back in late uh

291
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,160
1980s and so that includes IP you know

292
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,559
Innovation uh development kind of

293
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,319
looking at the past where we've been

294
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,319
where we're going to go you know talking

295
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,800
about

296
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,278
molecules uh so that was kind of the way

297
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,919
we set the table and this year you know

298
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,559
the interesting thing about camad is

299
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,838
that you guys have done such a nice job

300
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:24,479
with the event that there's a lot of

301
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,160
great topics going on at different times

302
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,278
or at same time so you know we've cut

303
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:31,879
down the the workshop to do six

304
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:33,838
presentations and they're a little Shor

305
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,078
this year but it's it's meant to allow

306
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,639
people to go across fertilize a lot of

307
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,039
different topics which you guys are

308
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,519
doing uh so what we're going to do is we

309
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,719
have six topics they're going to be a

310
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,399
little different excuse me I think we're

311
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,199
going to still include like last year

312
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,919
and this year we're going to still have

313
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:53,719
a a topic on cultivation or production

314
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,000
what we call alternative production

315
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,800
methods you know whether you're looking

316
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,078
at phyto sources or non-f sources some

317
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:04,359
people call it uh

318
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:06,439
um um synergistic compounds or

319
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,720
synthetics we don't really like that

320
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,160
nomenclature but then also another one

321
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,519
that we talked about last year another

322
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,039
topic we had which we're going to

323
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,480
replicate this year's intellectual

324
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,000
property that's going to continue to be

325
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,759
a big part of the industry and so I

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,679
think you know and by the by the way for

327
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,720
everybody listening I mean the the the

328
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,799
pro probably the best part about canmet

329
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,800
is the property that you guys put it on

330
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,359
in Marco Island the event is is amazing

331
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,439
the beach is the long the widest longest

332
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,720
beach we've ever seen or I've ever seen

333
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,600
it's awesome white sand too the white

334
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,680
sand uh and you guys also provide enough

335
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,278
time for people to to meet and greet and

336
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,838
so that's you know to be frank you know

337
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,039
we're we're looking at you know we

338
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,320
sponsored we were the lead

339
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,919
sponsor uh last year of what we believe

340
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,839
the most important events in cannabis

341
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:02,479
globally were uh one was benzinga Miami

342
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:06,040
another was ICBC and the GIF in Berlin

343
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,600
and then also canmed and uh right now

344
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,399
we've we certainly already committed

345
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,839
we'd like to replicate the same thing

346
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,480
with benzinga and ICBC but we've

347
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,279
certainly already signed up uh for camad

348
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,240
just because I think it's it's kind of a

349
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:21,799
part of the future of where cannabis is

350
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,639
going absolutely and we appreciate that

351
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,319
and you're right this was last year was

352
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,198
the first year that we included sort of

353
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,800
the investment angle but you're you're

354
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:33,000
absolutely right that it's it's

355
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:35,479
essential because research is not cheap

356
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,958
and for folks who are doing research

357
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,600
into cannaboids the sources of funding

358
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,479
are somewhat limited right because a lot

359
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,360
of it being because of the scheduling of

360
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,839
cannabis where you know you can't get

361
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,560
government grants or anything to do

362
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,399
research because it's a schedule one

363
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:54,159
drug so that is a nice little segue into

364
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,958
one of the topics that um it's really at

365
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,319
the top of a lot of people's minds as we

366
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:01,078
move into 2024 is this whole idea of the

367
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,959
possib ability of the DEA rescheduling

368
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,719
cannabis from a schedule one drug to a

369
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,838
schedule 3 um was interested to get your

370
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,360
thoughts on that um if you think that's

371
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,880
going to happen when maybe you think

372
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,800
that's going to happen and what does

373
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:18,120
that really mean for investment in the

374
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,719
uh in the industry well I mean first off

375
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,560
to say I think most people agree out

376
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,320
there that there's no crystal ball for

377
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:27,078
cannabis uh it's really a hard industry

378
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,000
to predict but that being said I was

379
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:31,879
looking through some old emails over the

380
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,559
holiday been and pulled up uh some

381
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:36,399
material that we've been asked to put

382
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,559
together for an ic3 event which is many

383
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,799
people in the no or not in the no but

384
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,958
they've been around the block in this

385
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,318
industry this was in New York in 20

386
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:49,078
October

387
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:51,278
2018 and uh Al foran was part of this uh

388
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:52,919
piece of paper uh that was put together

389
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,519
a number of us were asked to kind of

390
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:58,919
provide our predictions Tom Zuber uh VI

391
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,318
Desai a number of people and and one of

392
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,439
the things that we came out with looking

393
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:04,879
at is trying to predict in five years

394
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,279
what the sector is going to look like

395
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:10,000
one of the first things we started off

396
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:12,198
with was how many medical states are

397
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,759
there going to be in five years and we

398
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:16,599
did some simple math but we essentially

399
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:20,399
said that they're going to be 40 States

400
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,959
in in DC they're legal and Frankly

401
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,519
Speaking if you look back at it right

402
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,159
now and that was October 2018 five years

403
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:30,560
ago uh we hit the nail on the head

404
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:32,000
frankly and so not again there's no

405
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,078
Crystal Ball but the other thing that we

406
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,759
like to do at Golden Eagle Partners is

407
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,078
we're very quantitative again I have a

408
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,039
degree in Biochemistry and deg degree in

409
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,719
molecular biology luckily I have three

410
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:45,958
patents us patents to my name so we're

411
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,079
very analytical and quantitative and so

412
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,919
many of you may have seen uh the piece

413
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:54,599
that we put out on LinkedIn mid December

414
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,439
on trying to actually apply some of the

415
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,519
data that the DEA you know we looked at

416
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,600
the how many many uh compounds had been

417
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,318
scheduled rescheduled or descheduled in

418
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,640
the last 5 years and it was actually the

419
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,038
answer was

420
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,759
41 and then we looked at you know

421
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:12,078
applied when of those actually happen

422
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,480
What quarter of uh each calendar year

423
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,000
from 2018 on and uh and then we applied

424
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,959
that analysis to when we may might think

425
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
what this might happen and you know

426
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,600
again it's hard to predict but you know

427
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,078
coming of our analysis we thought you

428
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:28,759
know there's a 10% chance

429
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:31,678
that uh that it won't even be uh

430
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:34,359
schedule uh schedule three it might be a

431
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,280
schedule two uh but then if it's a

432
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,719
schedule three then you know when might

433
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,558
that happen what our thought was you

434
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,120
know there's probably 25% chance that if

435
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,200
they reschedule to schedule three it

436
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,399
might not even happen before the

437
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,519
election so that means and again this is

438
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,320
just kind of applying some trying to

439
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,000
sense to it and I think everybody would

440
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,720
agree listening to this that there's not

441
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
100% chance that the da is going to

442
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,000
reschedule this yeah uh before the

443
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,759
election uh but that that being said out

444
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
of the 75% chance we applied that to the

445
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,440
data that we saw and when these events

446
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,880
happen when the da announces these in

447
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,519
the Federal Register and our analysis

448
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,400
came up with the best chances in Q2 that

449
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,960
it will

450
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,240
be uh rescheduled a 41% chance that

451
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,759
it'll happen in Q2 now we've also heard

452
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,359
people thinking that the da is going to

453
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:27,038
announce a rescheduling of cannabus on

454
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,558
April uh you know 20th 420 but I can't

455
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,759
imagine that the the da is going to play

456
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,480
to the the Cannabis sector as a matter

457
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,679
of fact one of the points we don't think

458
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,759
they're going to play to the Cannabis

459
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,960
sector and that's one thing that during

460
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,200
the benzinga podcast with Hunter land

461
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,400
you know our thought is it's probably

462
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,840
not going to happen before the election

463
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,200
but one of the data points you know that

464
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:49,359
not many people saw is I think it was

465
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,480
December 12th just uh less than a month

466
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,399
ago the da announced adding another six

467
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,360
compound to schedule one and these are

468
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,759
cannabis

469
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,079
memetics now they're they're not

470
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,359
naturally occurring cannaboids and

471
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,759
they're not even cannabinoids they're

472
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,079
cannabis mics but mimetics but they do

473
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,440
hit the CB1 CB2

474
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,759
receptor and you know I I don't think

475
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,440
it's out of the realm of imagination to

476
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,279
assume that the da was thumbing their

477
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,720
nose at the Cannabis sector by throwing

478
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,519
these and essentially again to be clear

479
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,720
clear Ben it's a the da put these six

480
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,798
compounds on a temporary or preliminary

481
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,960
schedule one and after a year if they

482
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:30,000
their finings come to fruition they will

483
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,600
then keep it on or take it off schedule

484
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,839
one my guess is though that most people

485
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:38,359
don't realize that there are 43 cannabis

486
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:42,480
or cannabis mimetic canabo Associated

487
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:45,759
compounds on schedule one right now and

488
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,919
so now let's add to the 43 to the six so

489
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:52,519
now there's 49 43 was the number before

490
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,038
December uh and now there's 49 the other

491
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,158
thing that's so screwed up about this

492
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:58,519
whole thing that we we've want to make

493
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,640
him really important is that there's

494
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:03,798
over 500 compounds that are

495
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,559
scheduled uh by the DEA on schedule 1

496
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:08,279
through

497
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:10,079
five and of those there's only one of

498
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,038
those is not a compound that's cannabis

499
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,678
cannabis is not a compound cannabis is a

500
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:16,558
plant it's a Genus as we mentioned so

501
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,600
this whole thing about trying to apply

502
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,839
analysis and logic to what the da is

503
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:23,678
going to do this is really hard to do

504
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,439
because again the whole the whole logic

505
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,120
behind this again if you're applying the

506
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
the

507
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,918
biochemistry perspective on this

508
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,200
cannabis is not a compound it's a

509
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,799
collection of 500 plus compounds or more

510
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,120
than that probably right yeah and so

511
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:40,440
having them reschedule or deschedule

512
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,879
cannabis as itself you know it's

513
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,038
ridiculous so sorry that was a

514
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,280
long-winded explanation to it no but

515
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,798
it's interesting and you bring up a good

516
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,240
point one I wasn't aware of about the uh

517
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:55,839
cannabis mimetics that are on schedule

518
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:00,759
one but so allow me to play The Optimist

519
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:04,079
and if if the da if the DEA were to Q2

520
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:08,000
what's that Q2 but no go ahead if the

521
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,918
DEA were to reschedule cannabis from

522
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,119
schedule one to schedule three but keep

523
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,880
those mimetics on schedule one would

524
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:18,319
that be potentially a positive for those

525
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,679
of us who are uh you know rooting for

526
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,720
the Cannabis derived compounds because

527
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,200
there'll be three and the kind of

528
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,000
synthetic ones I know you don't like

529
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,600
that term but those will be sort of more

530
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,679
on the schedule one

531
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:34,439
well and that's a nuanced question

532
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:37,759
too uh it's you know a lot of well the

533
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,679
easy answer is absolutely with 28 now

534
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,720
the Assumption too is if they reschedule

535
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,640
from 1 to three that that requires that

536
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,679
the

537
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,200
IRS uh then get rid of 28 and as a

538
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,679
matter of fact a lot of people don't

539
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,159
understand that where 28 came from but

540
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,240
we don't probably need to get into that

541
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,760
but it was a drug dealer that got busted

542
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,319
in the early 80s when Reagan was the

543
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,599
president and just said no to drugs but

544
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:04,639
the drug dealer got away with a bunch of

545
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,918
money because he you know was fast with

546
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,600
his tax returns Etc so they wanted to

547
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,919
stop that but yeah I think uh the easy

548
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,719
answer is yeah if you get rescheduled a

549
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,038
three now if it goes to two the way 280

550
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,079
set up it doesn't do anything but if it

551
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,319
does go to schedule three it should be a

552
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:25,720
huge help for any plan touching uh

553
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:29,079
company that touches you know THC plus

554
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,480
as we call it uh in the US because it

555
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:33,199
should dramatically help their margins

556
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,159
the problem with that too though Ben is

557
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,000
that a lot of these companies that we

558
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,760
know since we've got in been in it so

559
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
long have rolled up some pretty

560
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:44,759
significant tax liabilities so even if

561
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,679
280 do 280e does get rolled back you

562
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,278
know I can guarantee you and I've had to

563
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,400
go to the IRS tax

564
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:54,919
Court uh on on on a thing before they're

565
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,200
not going to just immediately say oh you

566
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,200
know uh they're gonna forgive all the

567
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,038
back

568
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,000
taxes they're G to still require those

569
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:06,798
so 28 is going to be an interesting

570
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,599
thing but you know to be frank though

571
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,359
you know that's not a big part of canman

572
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,278
I mean the 280 and a lot of these

573
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,918
companies I mean the the one thing we

574
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:18,159
want to bring up too is the re the

575
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:21,000
importance of Biotech in in cannabis is

576
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,000
is incredibly important because in

577
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,798
especially going into 2024 because a lot

578
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,759
of people don't know about Switzerland

579
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,639
so Switzerland we believe is right now

580
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,558
at the Forefront of adult so we're just

581
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,360
talking about adult use and 280 and all

582
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,879
that stuff let's go to Switzerland so

583
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:37,519
Switzerland is

584
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,120
essentially uh is a has a program they

585
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,038
rolled out just last year just about a

586
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,038
year ago this year that's essentially

587
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,679
adult useth but it's very limited but

588
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,480
it's being tracked very effectively uh

589
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,200
it's being followed by the international

590
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,640
narcotics control board which is part of

591
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,278
the single Convention of 61 the fop

592
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,600
which is the federal Office of Public

593
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,440
Health in Switzerland is on board

594
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,359
tracking this so what they want to do is

595
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,640
have people will use this drug uh or you

596
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:05,319
know cannabis recreationally adult use

597
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,038
but then also track it over two years to

598
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,918
make sure that there's not any adverse

599
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,158
effects or anything which we know

600
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,559
there's really not going to be and we

601
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,919
think that appli like biotech really

602
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,200
stringent following of the adult use

603
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,200
Market is going to be one of the only

604
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,720
ways we get adult use to break out of

605
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,840
this kind of mess of overregulation by

606
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,079
the IRS overregulation by the UN over

607
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,119
ulation by the U EU over regulation by

608
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,879
almost every regulatory I mean in

609
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,558
Colorado the me still T over taxes

610
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,840
things so we think science and biotech

611
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:45,879
need to be applied to not only adult use

612
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,798
to but to the medical side to to dispel

613
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,360
a lot of the stigma that still stands in

614
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:53,200
the way of this amazing plan yeah no and

615
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,038
that's a a great Point kind of talking

616
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,200
about the distinction between medical

617
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,000
and adult use and folks I've talked to

618
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,038
before about about you know if and when

619
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,480
ever we get Federal legalization the

620
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:07,640
thought is that it will be medical first

621
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,759
before that before its adult use and you

622
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,360
know do you kind of see the the same see

623
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,720
it happening the same way that that's

624
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:18,479
sort of the first way to do it frankly I

625
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,278
you know what I don't care I mean you

626
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,319
know Matt doery works with me at at GP

627
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:25,558
thinks you know if we would the industry

628
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,038
would have put more emphasis on the

629
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:31,359
medical side then then we would not be

630
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,679
where we're at uh can't disagree with

631
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,199
that but you know I think we're a global

632
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,278
firm and what we're trying to do is you

633
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,759
know see how Regulators can open up

634
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,319
things I mean that like CBD in Australia

635
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,359
has been overregulation I won't go into

636
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,960
the full details but uh you know

637
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:54,038
globally you know we're seeing it kind

638
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,640
of you know uh come out of it shell but

639
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:58,319
the problem is too and we mentioned this

640
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,320
when I was in Davos in 2020 before the

641
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,960
during the world economic Forum before

642
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,519
the pandemic hit is that there's uh

643
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,798
three things we learned in North America

644
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,839
that might apply to Europe and one of

645
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,038
them is that geographies almost always

646
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,519
roll out a lot slower than you expect

647
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:14,440
them I mean if you look at Germany you

648
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:17,240
know they were expecting a year ago that

649
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,640
hey we're really talking about adult use

650
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,278
and then it continued to get stalled and

651
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,159
stalled and then they thought it might

652
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:27,398
be really going gang busters by now here

653
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,919
January 2024 and just in December last

654
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:31,319
year that got stalled off and again

655
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,880
we're talking about adult use yeah but

656
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,720
again I think let's get back to the main

657
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,600
point about canm it's about applying

658
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,440
technology and biotch to this amazing

659
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,719
plant in these compounds to find out

660
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,519
which compounds do which things and if

661
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,399
we can apply more really good data

662
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,200
behind all these different compounds

663
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,678
that are coming out then it will help us

664
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,919
dispel a lot of the

665
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,399
stigma and that and that is what we need

666
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,520
to do to get the regulator stop over

667
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:59,678
regulating to people have people new

668
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,440
adopters

669
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,159
adopt uh and for example there's a lot

670
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,200
of compounds that I haven't used yet

671
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,640
that I think that could be good for me

672
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,600
but it's hard to know which compounds

673
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,759
out of can cannabis compounds or

674
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:15,359
cannabinoids are good for which things I

675
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,720
don't even know that right yeah no and

676
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,479
there's a lot of them and that I know

677
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,240
that we're going to have a number of of

678
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,120
talks this year that are talking about

679
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,278
flavonoids so not not even canavs or

680
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,719
chines But but flavonoids so you know

681
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,519
the the number of different compounds

682
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,880
that have are showing potential it just

683
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,720
seems to be growing and growing every

684
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:38,480
year yeah well the other thing to talk

685
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,640
about 2024 and can that will be

686
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,399
interesting is that you know we're going

687
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,519
to be golden eagle Partners I'm going to

688
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:49,678
be at JP Morgan next week and JP Morgan

689
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,038
has become the de facto leading

690
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,399
conference in the

691
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,919
world uh as a matter of fact last night

692
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:56,719
I had a late night call with a leading

693
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:01,038
generics company out of India and

694
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,519
they're head of global uh Innovation is

695
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,599
going to be in San Francisco and

696
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,038
hopefully we'll have a call or a meeting

697
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:09,119
with them uh I used to be an investment

698
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,640
banker in biotech in San Francisco as I

699
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,479
mentioned and it was the biggest week of

700
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,960
the year you know when we're talking

701
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,120
about just biotech when we're talking

702
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,200
fizer we're talking mck kessen we're

703
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:20,719
talking large and small and biotech and

704
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,480
it's always been an interesting read of

705
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,640
how people see biotech but I think for

706
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,399
us it's going to be really interesting

707
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,559
because we haven't been there I haven't

708
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:30,918
been uh to JP Morgan since I got into

709
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,798
cannabis and it'll be interesting to see

710
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,038
what the the Scuttle butt is because you

711
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:35,519
know we do have meetings with some of

712
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:38,319
the leading Pharma

713
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,519
companies uh we have two clients that

714
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:43,439
are going to be there one client is out

715
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:45,278
of Australia that's trying to complete a

716
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,519
phase three clinical trial CBD and

717
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,240
another one's out of Canada that's

718
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,759
trying to start a phase one and do

719
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,120
preclinical with uh treating PTSD with

720
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,798
sosyan and eugal so again this is this

721
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,359
also and we've been in psychedelics for

722
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,879
three years too Ben just we we can't

723
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,398
cover all this in 30 minutes but again

724
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,080
the psych the Psychedelic sector is the

725
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,479
same it's the same it's it's same and

726
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,398
not I mean you know there there's a lot

727
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,440
of differences between the sectors but

728
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,879
the whole idea of trying to apply data

729
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,880
and really good High Fidelity data to

730
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,640
psychedelics to find out which compounds

731
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,159
can do which things for which people is

732
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,480
is this is the same same issue that we

733
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,360
need to overcome I believe yeah for sure

734
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,720
no and so you mentioned Farm so is there

735
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:33,199
a a growing interest in in cannabis from

736
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,839
the farmer

737
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,519
folks uh well I mean you know one thing

738
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,839
that people don't appreciate is the fact

739
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,759
that fizer and a Abbott Labs did quite a

740
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:47,199
bit of work back in the day and I even

741
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:49,879
think Ro did too in the 80s uh 70s and

742
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,519
80s uh and then they stopped and so I I

743
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,519
know these farming companies are looking

744
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,038
at it I think one of the big questions

745
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,599
with Pharma has been the fact a lot of

746
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:58,960
these compounds don't have composition

747
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:04,319
amount coverage which is usually a de

748
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:07,200
facto requirement by uh by Pharma to to

749
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,759
to do that to to find uh you know to

750
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,679
they need that to to support the drug

751
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,398
development of a drug okay I'm sorry

752
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,038
what is that oh sorry so composition of

753
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,639
matter coverage so when you have patents

754
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,278
you know mainly that you can break it

755
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,880
down to a method of use or composition

756
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:27,319
of matter and so method of use is like a

757
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,679
molecule and say okay well I'll use this

758
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:33,879
molecule for asthma and that coverage

759
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:36,840
can be tough because you know kind of uh

760
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,278
going after litigating somebody on how

761
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:40,678
they use it is tougher than saying okay

762
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,079
we have this molecule we have

763
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,440
composition of matter coverage which

764
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:48,519
means the the makeup of this molecule is

765
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,200
covered under patents so it's a much uh

766
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,759
more clear much more uh tougher thing to

767
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,319
get around although some people have

768
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,359
been able to get around stuff like that

769
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,200
in the past uh but you know it's it's

770
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:03,158
anybody's guess I mean that's why we're

771
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,840
going to JP Morgan Ben is that you know

772
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,639
it's it's hard to uh you know it's hard

773
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,720
to predict I mean we we talked to one of

774
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:14,558
the leading uh large Pharma VC

775
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,679
firms uh earlier this year less than six

776
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,398
months ago and uh I've known her for 20

777
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:23,278
years before I got into cannabis and I

778
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:25,278
asked her you know or them you know what

779
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,638
they about cannabis and they said they

780
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,798
essentially said still no and they said

781
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:31,599
well we don't have a stated interest so

782
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:33,079
you know and that's I'm sure that's not

783
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,480
just that company it's a lot of these

784
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:37,798
companies that they they a lot of these

785
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,278
Pharma companies are always looking at

786
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:43,480
Innovation and they're always need to

787
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:45,798
look at new areas uh to attack and to

788
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,278
make money a lot of people don't like to

789
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:50,839
hear that come from Cannabis because a

790
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,919
lot of people uh from Cannabis are um

791
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,839
you know are purist and I get that and

792
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,360
as you mentioned you have the Entourage

793
00:31:54,839 --> 00:32:00,558
effect then you have the big the big

794
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,199
cannabis play too uh I think what we're

795
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,599
still trying to do though is help the

796
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,798
small companies and the private

797
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,439
companies come up with the appropriate

798
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:10,359
data or the business plan or you know

799
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,600
like for us you know we're not built on

800
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:15,199
data Golden Eagle Partners we want to

801
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:17,759
build a firm too that that can't be uh

802
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,240
run over by a Goldman Sachs or maril

803
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,839
Lynch uh we think we maybe been able to

804
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,720
achieve that with a relationships we

805
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,079
have globally and the expertise we have

806
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,038
going back to the 80s but that's no

807
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,839
guarantee we're not going to get run

808
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:31,759
over by Goldman when things maybe roll

809
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,599
back and that's same thing with any

810
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,398
small company in cannabis doing science

811
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,798
or otherwise adult use or medical right

812
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:41,239
right yeah and so I guess kind of to tie

813
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:44,200
it back all back to the uh the workshop

814
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,679
here so is that really sort of who

815
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,840
you're tailoring this this content for

816
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:53,720
is sort of the the small company who is

817
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:55,480
is starting up and is looking into some

818
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,399
of these novel compounds and they're

819
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,038
looking for funding they can come to the

820
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:02,638
workshop and kind of learn some best

821
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:05,798
practices to the best way to to get some

822
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:08,240
funding no actually it's meant to go

823
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:09,879
across the Spectrum it's meant to reach

824
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,359
out to biotech companies it meant to

825
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,720
reach out to Pharma companies it's meant

826
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,439
to reach out to small companies it's

827
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,558
meant to reach out to PNG you know

828
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,320
companies that are not biotech or Pharma

829
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:21,558
oriented that are out on the outside

830
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:23,638
looking in because what we've all been

831
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:27,519
about GP Golden Eagle partner has always

832
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:29,278
been about Ben is is help Prov providing

833
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,480
you know trying to find the best capital

834
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:32,519
for the best companies whether it's

835
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,000
inside or outside of cannabis and that

836
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,079
also means to be the purveyor of

837
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,159
objective information to a lot of these

838
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:39,759
companies that are on the outside

839
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,519
looking in that don't understand the

840
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,079
sector and frankly we understand it

841
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,638
better than a lot of people and and

842
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,398
Frankly Speaking whether it's a big

843
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,798
company or small company and they want

844
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:51,319
to get into cannabis the smartest thing

845
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:52,879
that they could do is come to Gold Neal

846
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:54,720
partners and say what should we do

847
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,200
instead of trying to go in there and

848
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,558
throw a lot of money at it and lose it

849
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,399
because I can guarant guarantee you one

850
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:01,319
thing is for sure in cannabis there's

851
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:03,398
been a lot of money lost by people that

852
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:05,759
have been too arrogant and with too

853
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:07,839
little arrogance and too much too too

854
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:12,280
much arrogance and too little humility

855
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:13,799
it's a fact so if if companies want to

856
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,679
understand the Canabis sector better

857
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,720
especially where the science is going

858
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,960
then yeah they would be prudent to show

859
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:22,838
up at the the cital markets

860
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,000
Workshop excellent well I think that's a

861
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:27,078
