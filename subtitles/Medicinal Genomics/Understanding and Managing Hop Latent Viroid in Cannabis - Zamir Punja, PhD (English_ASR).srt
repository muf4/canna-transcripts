1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,160
good morning everyone thank you to the

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,259
organizers for giving me the opportunity

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,539
to speak today we're going to shift

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,399
gears a little bit and get into the

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,500
cultivation side of things

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,420
and for those of you that perhaps don't

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,778
have any experience in seeing how

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,000
cannabis is grown I think this will be a

9
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,339
great chance for you to learn the

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,099
procedures but more importantly I'd like

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,800
to talk about a major threat to the

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,859
Cannabis industry and that is a disease

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,239
that's called hop latent viroid and

14
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,238
you'll see some of the features and

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,320
characteristics of this particular

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,718
disease today

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,859
so eat your heart out this is my work

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,739
environment

19
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,299
this is where I spend two days a week in

20
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:49,320
the greenhouse looking at cannabis

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,799
cultivation

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,058
this is a greenhouse operation in

23
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,878
British Columbia Canada

24
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:59,159
and all of the data that I'll present

25
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,479
today comes from an environment such as

26
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:06,298
this and you can see a highly uniform

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:09,959
well sophisticated and hydroponically

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:13,520
cultivated cannabis production which of

29
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:17,459
course is the high THC or marijuana

30
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:20,280
this is what the pathogen or disease hop

31
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:23,099
latent viroid can do to plants on your

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,560
left is the stunted infected plant that

33
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,319
has hop latent viroid and on your right

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,180
is the healthy plant and you can see

35
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,758
right away that you've got a a

36
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,979
significant reduction in growth which

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,920
we'll you'll see later correlates to a

38
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:41,039
reduction in the amount of cannabis

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,019
flour as well as THC that comes out from

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,500
these plants

41
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,959
here again is a really nice comparison

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,859
infected on your left a healthy plant on

43
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:55,559
your right smaller leaves darker leaves

44
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:57,780
not as vigorous growing as what you

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,859
would expect in a client that does not

46
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,859
have this particular pathogen

47
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:09,598
what exactly is poplite enviroid it's a

48
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:12,000
RNA molecule that exists in these

49
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,759
particular plants they happen to be the

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,080
absolutely smallest

51
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,340
pathogenic organism that we know of

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,500
which is 50 micro nanometers which is

53
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,200
one or five one hundredths of a micron

54
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,719
it is so small that we can't even see it

55
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,359
other than with an electron microscope

56
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,098
it's a it's a pathogen that does occur

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,760
on other plant species such as potato

58
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:38,280
and chrysanthemum Peach and so on it

59
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,439
does not affect humans or animals it

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,900
seems to be restricted primarily to

61
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,939
plants and at this point in time I

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,819
consider this to be the covid of the

63
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,680
Cannabis world and you'll see why in a

64
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:51,539
few minutes

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,019
so it was first reported in California

66
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:57,299
back in 2019 and plants there were

67
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,879
stunted not well developed the flowers

68
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,719
were were not doing well the plants were

69
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,340
not rooting well and the symptoms does

70
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,620
vary depending on what stage of the

71
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,060
plant we're looking at and I'll describe

72
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,459
some of this as we go through the

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,560
presentation today

74
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,739
so here you see a plant that's in full

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,500
flower on the left hand side is the

76
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,319
stunted plant that is obviously affected

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,739
by this hop latent viroid produces much

78
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:28,219
smaller flowers and overall yield has

79
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,219
gone down

80
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,120
this is what the pathogen will do when

81
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,219
it infects a plant and the

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,800
inflorescences or flowers are developing

83
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,859
you can see that the infected flowers

84
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,719
are much smaller and will produce much

85
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,799
less

86
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:46,199
cannabinoids overall

87
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,120
when you actually look at them side by

88
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,500
side morphologically they're no

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,480
different other than the fact that

90
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,479
they're considerably smaller in size

91
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:59,639
in some genotypes or chemovars we do see

92
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,680
a symptom such as this it almost looks

93
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,139
like a chrysanthemum type flower the

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,000
yellowing that you see is not common

95
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,818
this is not something that you'd like to

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,840
see in a cannabis flower you're seeing a

97
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:15,298
lower production of of chlorophyll

98
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,978
and in addition the roots are affected

99
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,739
you can see the healthy compared to the

100
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,379
infected root systems the plant isn't

101
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,239
doing well it's not growing well and as

102
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,180
a result it's going to produce less

103
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,800
flour and and less yield and that's a

104
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,199
really good comparison of how the root

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,620
systems have have developed on these two

106
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,620
plants

107
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,539
Growers know that when they take cuts to

108
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,419
propagate cannabis the cuts that come

109
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,740
from infected plants do not root well so

110
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:45,899
here again what you're seeing is the

111
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,879
underside of a rooting block the

112
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:51,120
infected one on your left the healthy

113
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,978
one on the right very reduced root

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,620
production so this is quite an

115
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:57,779
interesting pathogen it affects the the

116
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,240
flowers it affects the growth it affects

117
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:03,439
the roots and as you'll see later on it

118
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,439
affects the cannabinoids

119
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:07,560
so obviously when you have a plant

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,540
that's producing a poor root system it's

121
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,120
not going to grow as well it's going to

122
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,220
be obviously stunted and it's not going

123
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,620
to be taking up as much nutrients as it

124
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,840
should and in addition I'll show you at

125
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,300
the end of the talk that these plants

126
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,758
also seem to have increased

127
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,400
susceptibility to other pathogens

128
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,100
so this is where the covid analogy comes

129
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,679
in people that suffer from covid usually

130
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,900
have other

131
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,879
disabilities or other issues that affect

132
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,459
the liver or the hearts or other parts

133
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,219
of the of the body when these plants

134
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:43,739
have hop latent viroid they may also be

135
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,639
reduced in their ability to fight off

136
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,639
other diseases

137
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,538
now here's a really interesting slide

138
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,199
that compares one plant in which one

139
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:57,478
side of the plant has the high plate and

140
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,360
viroid which is the bottom side and the

141
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,219
top side is actually healthy and so here

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,199
we can make a direct side-by-side

143
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,479
comparison and you look at the numbers

144
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,139
you'll see where it says hoplate and

145
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:13,860
negative the THC concentration is 27.8

146
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,960
and the terpene concentration is 1.3 you

147
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,660
move down to the lower left where it

148
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,538
says hop latent positive your THC

149
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,080
concentration has dropped to 15.9

150
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:27,300
percent almost a 40 percent reduction in

151
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,839
your terpene levels have dropped to 1.1

152
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,520
about a 15 reduction now this is pretty

153
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,119
significant for those of you that work

154
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,918
in the industry for medicinal or

155
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,660
pharmacological use when you have a

156
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,519
plant that's infected with hoplate and

157
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:46,639
viroid it's going to produce less

158
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,639
cannabinoids less THC and less terpenes

159
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,900
here's a very good comparison of what a

160
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,620
harvested plant will produce with regard

161
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,359
to Absolute yield and so once again

162
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,579
healthy on the left and hop latent

163
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,340
infected on the right you can see the

164
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:05,579
smaller size overall whale over yield

165
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:09,000
well over dry mass as a result of this

166
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,000
particular pathogen

167
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,220
now the reason that the cannabinoids are

168
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,220
reduced is shown here in this schematic

169
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,580
where you have a nice healthy trichome

170
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,220
on your left in a trichome that comes

171
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,899
from a diseased plant on the right and

172
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,360
what we see and I'll show you this in

173
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:30,239
the next few slides is a reduction in

174
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,460
the size of the trichomes and in the

175
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,918
volume of material that they can produce

176
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,560
and so because these trichomes are

177
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,659
primarily synthesizing cannabinoids and

178
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,060
terpenes when you have a reduced

179
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,460
shrunken trichome clearly that's going

180
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,860
to impact what's being harvested from

181
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,959
that plant

182
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,538
so here's a comparison this is using a

183
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,459
scanning electron microscope where it

184
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,860
says healthy are the healthy bracks

185
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,318
comes from the flowers that are not

186
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,939
infected by this pathogen and over on

187
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,759
the other side where it says infected

188
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:05,759
you can see overall that the little

189
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,500
blobs the trichomes are smaller and

190
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,479
they're stunted in terms of how they

191
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,519
develop

192
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,258
and here's a close-up again where it

193
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,779
says healthy these are the trichome

194
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,520
glands or the bulbs where all these

195
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,579
cannabinoids that we heard about from Dr

196
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,098
Russo and other speakers are contained

197
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,959
and on the bottom is the inflated

198
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,240
trichome gland

199
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,939
look at the infected plants where the

200
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,099
trichomes are shriveled much smaller in

201
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,918
size and obviously are going to produce

202
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,539
much less cannabinoids and terpenes and

203
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,418
so this is why this disease this

204
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:41,939
pathogen is of such concern when you see

205
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:44,278
this impact reduction in your

206
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,640
cannabinoids it's clearly a cause for

207
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,639
concern

208
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,299
now we've collected some data on a

209
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,459
number of different strains or genotypes

210
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,979
of cannabis and this is what this table

211
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:58,259
is basically showing you is how this

212
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,720
particular pathogen impacts plant height

213
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,659
which is the first column the flower

214
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,180
stem length the second column flower

215
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:09,299
fresh weight the third column and then

216
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:11,699
finally THC and you can see overall that

217
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:15,000
the range of reduction is anywhere from

218
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:19,980
27 to 31 percent lower

219
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,259
THC is down 28.8 percent overall varies

220
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,019
by strain there's some strains that you

221
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,778
see a 12 reduction in other strains

222
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,459
almost a 40 reduction so there

223
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:32,039
definitely appears to be a genotype

224
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:35,899
effect in terms of how the these plants

225
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,899
respond to this pathogen

226
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,099
now in order to detect this particular

227
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,339
organism this pathogen we use what's

228
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,320
called a PCR method rtpcr again very

229
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,899
similar to what was developed for

230
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,600
analysis of covid and what you're seeing

231
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,639
here is a gel and the bands the white

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,180
bands that you see the multiple bands

233
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,740
indicate the presence of the pathogen so

234
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,620
I'll be showing you a number of these

235
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,139
slides that illustrate wherever you see

236
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,839
the white bands it tells you that the

237
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:09,299
Hop latent viroid is present in that

238
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,860
particular sample

239
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:13,079
so here what we've done is we've

240
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,019
compared a range of different types of

241
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,120
cannabis plants different genotypes and

242
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,580
basically what this is telling you is

243
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,519
that hop latent viroid was present in

244
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,339
all of them using these particular PCR

245
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,440
primers the arrow where it says root

246
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,000
sample

247
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,519
indicates the presence of the viral in

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,259
the roots of the plants as well

249
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,259
and this becomes significant as you'll

250
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,659
see in a few minutes

251
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:42,000
so how does this thyroid spread again

252
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:44,338
very similar to covet it spreads through

253
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,799
contact through handling of plants

254
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,839
through any tools or instruments that

255
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,359
Growers are going to be using to take

256
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,579
care of their plants it can also move

257
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,919
through root contact and I'll indicate

258
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:58,679
how that happens it can move through

259
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,078
water if there's recycled water that's

260
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,359
being used in the facility hot plate and

261
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:06,059
viroid can be found we don't know if

262
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
it's transmitted by insects yet and we

263
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,659
do know that it's transmitter

264
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,220
transmitted through seeds and that's a

265
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,439
really important implication for the

266
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,019
industry as well so this thing does

267
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,480
really get around extremely well through

268
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,919
handling and through contact and through

269
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,920
water and through seeds

270
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,518
so here's an experiment we did where we

271
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,160
artificially introduced the hot plate

272
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,220
and viroid using a Q-tip that was dipped

273
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,259
in infected sap and the lower panel

274
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,959
shows you that after you've introduced

275
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:39,778
the viroid within two weeks it can be

276
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,879
detected first of all in the roots it

277
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:44,338
moves from the upper stem into the roots

278
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,200
within a period of about two weeks

279
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,019
and then when you come back and revisit

280
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,360
that plant at four weeks and six weeks

281
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,060
what you find eventually is that the

282
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,620
entire plant is infected so again what

283
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:58,500
you're seeing on the lower left those

284
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,200
bars indicate the presence of the viroid

285
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,899
and over on the right it indicates how

286
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,120
this particular organism is spreading

287
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,700
so from the point of inoculation which

288
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,159
was the top it moves down into the roots

289
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,079
and then from there upwards into the

290
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:14,219
rest of the plant and that becomes

291
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:16,939
really important from a management

292
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,940
perspective

293
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,139
so this is what we know about hop latent

294
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:24,179
viroid is that it moves systemically

295
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,338
inside the plant through tissues that

296
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,019
are called the phloem the phloem is

297
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,940
basically the plumbing system in the

298
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,159
plant and so when you've got something

299
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,680
in the roots the plumbing system will

300
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,539
make sure that that viroid moves up into

301
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,719
the leaves and of course into the

302
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,719
flowers

303
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,519
so we also conducted another experiment

304
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:46,979
where we placed an infected plant next

305
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,379
to a healthy plant inside these cloners

306
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,120
so what we were trying to show here was

307
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,519
the spread of the viroid through water

308
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,799
the two plants were not in contact with

309
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,259
one another and the the nutrient

310
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,179
solution was being circulated and lo and

311
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:03,179
behold the little plant that you see on

312
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:05,578
the left which is marked infected spread

313
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:09,500
the viroid over to the plant on the

314
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:09,500
right simply through water transmission

315
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,458
and so we demonstrated that again using

316
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,860
these two plants that are placed in the

317
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,439
flat the plant on the left was infected

318
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,180
the plant on the right was not we

319
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,399
flooded water through those two plants

320
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:26,819
and lo and behold we had a 20

321
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,860
transmission rate of from one plant to

322
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,019
the next so this is a common way that

323
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,720
Growers will water their plants is to

324
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,000
flood them and the idea here now is that

325
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,899
the viroid could move quite readily

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,899
through the watering system

327
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,040
this was an interesting experiment where

328
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,919
we took a bunch of clones cuttings made

329
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,778
from three infected mother plants and as

330
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,939
you can see the roots are starting to

331
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:53,338
emerge on the bottom of the cuts at

332
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,959
varying at varying levels what was

333
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:58,019
really interesting was that in each and

334
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:00,299
every cut or clone that rooted we found

335
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,860
hot late and viroid to be present and

336
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,979
that's shown on the gel on the bottom

337
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,320
every sample had those white bands which

338
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,659
indicates that the viroid was present so

339
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,519
this is another very important Way by

340
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:12,539
which this pathogen moves is through

341
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,159
cuttings

342
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:18,259
through cuttings that are made from

343
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,259
infected plants and are rooted

344
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,920
so here's just a summary when you've got

345
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,680
the viroid being introduced into the

346
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,778
roots it'll spread upward into the rest

347
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,578
of the plant I'll show you some data in

348
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:32,458
just a minute that it gets into the

349
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:34,799
flowers it gets into the male flowers it

350
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:37,199
gets into the female flowers and it gets

351
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,479
into the seed and again that becomes

352
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,699
real problematic as as far as how this

353
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,659
disease may be distributed throughout

354
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:44,659
the Cannabis industry

355
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:49,259
we observe that when plants go into

356
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,659
flower and those of you that may not be

357
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,759
familiar for cannabis to flower the

358
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:56,759
photo period has to be switched from 12

359
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,379
hours of light to 12 hours of dark and

360
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,539
the minute you start to do that what we

361
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,059
observed was that the concentration of

362
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:04,919
the viroids started to increase and it

363
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,259
started to move upward into the flowers

364
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,299
so what you're seeing here is a plant

365
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:12,059
that's on the left that is receiving

366
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:14,219
full light and on the right is the one

367
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,899
that goes into flower and when you start

368
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,778
looking for the viroid you see a

369
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:21,059
dramatic increase as you see with the

370
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,159
presence of these white bands in the

371
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,838
plants that are under 12 and 12 photo

372
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,659
period which is the flowering period

373
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,459
compared to the panel on the right which

374
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,439
receive full day lines

375
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:34,018
so we think that the switching of the

376
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,000
plants from a vegetative stage into a

377
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,220
flowering stage is causing that

378
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,958
particular viroid to move upward into

379
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,300
the flowers we don't know why just yet

380
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:46,458
but it's an interesting and has

381
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:46,458
implications for seed transmission

382
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,240
in fact when we analyzed dried hot

383
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,859
flowers that are out there in the

384
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,539
marketplace we went to 12 or 15

385
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,278
different dispensaries

386
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,799
40 percent

387
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,259
40 percent of the dried flowers that we

388
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,120
collected from dispensaries had hop late

389
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,980
and viroid present in them

390
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,659
now as I mentioned this is not a human

391
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,639
pathogen so it's nothing that we need to

392
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,679
be concerned about what you need to be

393
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,360
concerned about is the fact that the

394
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,120
presence of the viroid in those flowers

395
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,100
is going to alter the cannabinoids the

396
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,440
terpenes and the ratios of those

397
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,980
cannabinoids and that obviously has

398
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,779
implications for medicinal use

399
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,879
so here's an example of where we

400
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:29,698
detected hoplate and viroid in male

401
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,100
flowers male flowers are used primarily

402
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,698
just for breeding and you can see the

403
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,759
panel on the right where we looked at

404
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:42,139
floral tissues anthers and other parts

405
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,139
of the flower it was present

406
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,360
so this is data that we got from Tumi

407
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,579
genomics where they made crosses between

408
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,919
plants that were positive for hop late

409
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:54,958
and viroid and male plants that were

410
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:57,059
negative for hot blade and viroid and

411
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,458
they did the opposite across as well

412
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,859
where they took female plants that were

413
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:05,039
negative for hop latent and crossed them

414
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,419
with male plants that were positive and

415
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,938
what they found when you do these

416
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,939
crosses is that you can find the viroid

417
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:14,040
in the seed on the seed and on the seed

418
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,319
coat as well

419
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,779
so here's the data that they shared with

420
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,818
me the orange bars indicate the presence

421
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:24,058
of the viroid in seed

422
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:25,859
where the female plant was infected and

423
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:27,779
the bars on the right show you the

424
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,000
presence of the viroid when the male

425
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:32,339
plant was infected so you can see

426
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,679
obviously a higher transmission when the

427
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:36,720
female plants are infected but also

428
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,120
transmission when the male plants are

429
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,860
infected or as a source of pollen

430
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,798
and when you look at the actual numbers

431
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,479
of seed infection it can be as high as

432
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:47,279
43 percent

433
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,160
that's a pretty high transmission rate

434
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,259
through seeds it varies a lot from plant

435
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,679
to plant but that is indeed quite a

436
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:55,679
significant observation

437
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,899
the good news is that there are

438
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:03,538
differences amongst cannabis chemovars

439
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,360
or genotypes in response to this disease

440
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:10,500
this shows you the relative frequency of

441
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:13,079
infection the bars indicate how much

442
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,819
infection you had and you can see with

443
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,038
the lower bars the two arrows on the

444
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:19,379
bottom they seem to be some genotypes

445
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,980
that have a better ability to withstand

446
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:25,700
this disease than others very good news

447
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,679
for breeders

448
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,660
we conducted an eradication program in

449
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,360
eradication program is where every

450
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,700
single plant that's infected is removed

451
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,459
from a growing facility and what this

452
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,340
this bar graph is showing you this line

453
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:46,259
graph is the removal of plants from June

454
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:48,839
of 2022 until January of 2023 and you

455
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:51,419
see rises in half latent viral infection

456
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,220
and you see declines in viral infection

457
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,840
but the the

458
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,298
um the horizontal line or the line

459
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,058
that's pointing downwards indicates that

460
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:02,279
eradication can work if it's done

461
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,798
successfully over a very long period of

462
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,899
time every single plant that's infected

463
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,259
needs to be removed from a growing

464
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,259
facility

465
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,418
there is options for tissue culture as a

466
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:19,200
way to eliminate this particular viroid

467
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:21,240
what I show here are two panels the top

468
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,400
panel is where you can use Mary stem

469
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,640
culture on the bottom panel is where you

470
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,380
use nodal stem culture to produce plants

471
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,160
Mary stem culture is the preferred way

472
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,440
in order to try to obtain plants that

473
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,200
are free from this disease

474
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,360
there are some things that are needed to

475
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,700
be resolved before tissue culture can be

476
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,038
used the plants really need to be tested

477
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,019
rigorously to make sure that they don't

478
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:48,900
contain the viroid but it is a

479
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:51,000
possibility that marriage stem culture

480
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,519
could be a way to eliminate this

481
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,859
particular pathogen

482
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,079
how well does this virus survive

483
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:00,719
unfortunately again it is quite a bit

484
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,319
like covid this is a slide that

485
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,298
indicates it survives on gloves in this

486
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,220
case it survives on gloves for up to

487
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,259
five days when the gloves are left at

488
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,900
room temperature

489
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,940
it survives in leaves in this case it

490
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,679
survives in leaves for up to four weeks

491
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,140
leaves that are left in the greenhouse

492
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,240
on the floor

493
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,799
it also survives in various types of

494
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,740
root tissues and I'll show you a couple

495
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,839
of slides that indicate that this viroid

496
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,660
is extremely stable

497
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,980
it is extremely stable for example when

498
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,660
you look at temperature

499
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,579
this was where we took small root

500
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,679
tissues that were infected by the viroid

501
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:41,279
and heated them up to 70 degrees

502
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,679
Centigrade for 30 minutes and the the

503
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,379
white bars again indicate the presence

504
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,200
of the viroid even heating that tissue

505
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,559
to 70 degrees for 30 minutes did not

506
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,900
destroy the RNA

507
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:58,619
this is an example where we took UVC

508
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:01,740
light UVC irradiation and we exposed

509
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:03,779
leaves and roots for five minutes long

510
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,839
enough to cause a severe burn on your

511
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:09,119
hand and the viroid was still intact you

512
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,099
can see the the bars are present so it's

513
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,199
UV stable

514
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:16,079
and more than that it can tolerate

515
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,819
things like bleach and zero tall and

516
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,519
vercon these are chemicals that normally

517
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:23,879
as disinfectants would eliminate covid

518
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,259
they have absolutely no effect on this

519
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,320
particular viroid because of the

520
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:31,440
stability of the RNA that's not to say

521
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,779
that these chemicals cannot be used in a

522
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,820
cleanup operation but it indicates that

523
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:39,079
they neither of these chemicals actually

524
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:39,079
destroys the RNA

525
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,320
well here's the good news I I have to

526
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,480
end the talk with a little bit of Hope

527
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:47,538
because everything I've said so far

528
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,058
indicates this thing is so stable

529
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:53,279
nucleic acid enzymes things that are

530
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:54,960
called nucleases in particularly a

531
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,440
particular type of nucleus that's called

532
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,360
rnas III will actually destroy the RNA

533
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,220
of this thyroid so here what you're

534
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,439
seeing the vertical arrows the blue

535
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,720
arrows indicate where we added the

536
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,798
enzyme the nucleuses and it totally

537
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,720
disrupted and destroyed the viroid what

538
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,298
does this mean from practical purposes I

539
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,519
have no idea what we do know though is

540
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:20,220
that there are specific enzymes that

541
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,558
could be used somewhere on the line to

542
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,659
actually destroy this particular um this

543
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,779
far away

544
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:29,340
so quickly I'll show you how hop latent

545
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:32,339
viral infected plants are more

546
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:34,500
susceptible to other diseases this is a

547
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,418
disease that's called fusarium oxosporum

548
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,298
Wilt and you'll notice where it says

549
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,520
hoplate minus and hop latent plus the

550
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:44,158
one that has hop latent viroid actually

551
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,679
picks up more fusarium infection than

552
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,120
the plant that's that's not infected

553
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,120
and here you can see a very nice

554
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,859
comparison of two flowering stems the

555
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,319
one on the left with the white mycelium

556
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:58,079
is the plant that was infected with hop

557
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,599
latent the one on the right did not and

558
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,699
you can see how much disease they

559
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:03,899
develop as a result of the infection by

560
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,038
the viroid

561
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,259
yeah

562
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,720
here's some data to illustrate the the

563
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:12,359
blue arrows basically tell you that

564
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,880
those are the lines in which fusarium

565
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,219
was increased as a result of the

566
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,799
presence of the hoplate viroid and

567
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,779
that's of concern because it indicates

568
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,740
that those plants maybe maybe more

569
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:28,019
susceptible to other pathogens

570
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,460
and lastly we looked at powdery mildew

571
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,379
which is another important disease in

572
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,480
the industry and what we found again

573
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,059
with powdery mildew is that when you

574
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,279
have hop latent viroid present you get

575
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:40,558
more infection with powdery mildew than

576
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,418
you do when the plants are healthy and

577
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,298
the in the graph on the bottom indicates

578
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:48,059
the green line is the infected plant and

579
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:49,980
the blue line is the plant that does not

580
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,500
have hot latent viroid

581
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,019
and so this is my last but one slide and

582
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,259
I'll show you the really amazing

583
00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:01,139
contrast between a hop latent infected

584
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,900
plant with powdery mildew and a hop

585
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,100
negative plant with some powdery mildew

586
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,919
but not a lot

587
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:09,959
so again this is a predisposition to

588
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,080
other diseases that may be present in

589
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,400
the Cannabis operation

590
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:16,379
so there still are a number of

591
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,200
unanswered questions we can probably

592
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,480
discuss those over the break I think

593
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,819
we're almost out of time here but what

594
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,220
is the basis for differences among

595
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:29,279
cannabis chemovirus or genotypes to this

596
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,839
disease we're not really sure yet can we

597
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,399
develop a screening method for this

598
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,099
pathogen possibly

599
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,860
do plants that grow in soil get less

600
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:39,719
thyroid maybe everything I showed you

601
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:41,699
today was in Hydroponics

602
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,620
there's a there's a phenomenon called

603
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,779
latent infection in these plants we need

604
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:48,119
to understand more about that and

605
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,220
certainly things like mycorrhizae will

606
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,619
they protect plants from Hop latent we

607
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,360
don't know that

608
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:56,759
so I'll end here with an acknowledgment

609
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,979
to the research assistants and students

610
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,919
that help you in the research as well as

611
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,599
funding agencies and our collaborators

612
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,640
and various government agencies for

613
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,418
providing funding and thank you very

614
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,419
much for your attention

615
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:15,599
thank you Samir that was very

616
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:18,298
enlightening

617
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:21,719
um I've heard that some tissue culture

618
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:25,019
labs are not successful in eradicating

619
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,480
hlv are there tricks that you could

620
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:28,918
indicate to us to increase the success

621
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,599
rate

622
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,340
yeah so that's that's a really good

623
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,339
question and I think it varies a lot

624
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:38,699
from Lab to lab I think the key is to

625
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:40,558
first of all only obtain tissues from

626
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,538
the tissue culture plant that you're

627
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,798
going to use that's at the very top of

628
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:46,079
the meristem

629
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,058
uh the other thing that they that has to

630
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,460
be done is the plants that you use

631
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:52,678
should not have high levels of the

632
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,620
viroid in other words you need to try to

633
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,059
suppress the this the spread through uh

634
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:59,219
whatever mechanisms might be available

635
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:02,579
whether it's through the use of

636
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,700
antiviral chemicals or in some cases

637
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:08,399
some researchers have stated plants that

638
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,259
are incubated under cold conditions uh

639
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,360
will actually have less replication of

640
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:14,700
these thyroid so you put the plants in

641
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,158
cold uh you take only very small

642
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,558
meristematic tissues and then you really

643
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,539
need to test you need to test you need

644
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,298
to test you need to test because this

645
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,278
viroid does stay latent again similar to

646
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:28,079
covid it's in your body but it doesn't

647
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:30,000
manifest unless there's some stressful

648
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,220
condition or some environmental

649
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,919
condition the plants need to be

650
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,839
completely tested well to make sure that

651
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,860
they're clean before we actually release

652
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,778
them

653
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,158
so there's definitely a lot of effort

654
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:42,960
going into that and I think that's going

655
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,159
to be one of the ways in which we can

656
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,159
eradicate this disease

657
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,000
yes

658
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
yes

659
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:02,658
thank you

660
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,038
a whole year or some

661
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:19,619
or something

662
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,178
right right so um the the nucleus

663
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:23,158
approach is not going to replace

664
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,080
marriage stem culture or anything else

665
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,059
that that the industry wants to look at

666
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,460
so it's going to be something right now

667
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:30,839
that's strictly hypothetical the data

668
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,000
the slide that I showed you here was

669
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,678
actually taken about five days ago where

670
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,900
we we wanted to run the experiment to

671
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,900
prove the concept that there are enzymes

672
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,720
that will destroy the the the specific

673
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:45,120
rnas in this thyroid how you apply it

674
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,919
where you get it from how you use it is

675
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,658
completely unknown are we going to

676
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,940
genetically engineer plant to produce

677
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:53,220
nucleuses are we going to insert

678
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,340
nucleases into the plant are we going to

679
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,798
use a bacterium to deliver the nucleases

680
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:01,319
we don't know that yet but all we do

681
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,839
know is that there is one approach that

682
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:05,819
can hypothetically destroy this thyroid

683
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,678
now it could be something that's used as

684
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,839
a cleaning agent you apply it to the

685
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,480
surface like you would UV light and

686
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,399
remove any viroid that's on the outside

687
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,620
how you actually introduce that into the

688
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,940
plant is is something that I think is

689
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:22,099
going to still require a lot of

690
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,100
conceptual design and experimentation

691
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,900
Dr punja a very informative talk as

692
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,400
always

693
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,220
as as we know there are some plans that

694
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,278
are capable of keeping the the level of

695
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,620
hlvd molecule at Bay particularly in the

696
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,119
root area so it seems that there are

697
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:41,759
some effective defense mechanisms

698
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,439
present in these plants and as you know

699
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,480
I'm interested in genetic resistance to

700
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,519
diseases I was wondering if you might

701
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,339
have any opinion about the nature of

702
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,200
these defense mechanisms yeah so the

703
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:53,759
question was you know there as I

704
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,278
mentioned earlier there are plants or

705
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,200
cultivars or chemovars that differ in

706
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,179
their ability to withstand this thyroid

707
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,798
again very similar to humans and covid

708
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,960
some people get more of it some people

709
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:06,058
get less of it and we only are now

710
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,220
beginning to understand that in Plants

711
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:11,038
it's very similar some plants can fight

712
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,120
this thing off much better than others

713
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,819
um there are definitely genetic

714
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,619
mechanisms that determine that we're not

715
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:19,200
quite ready to get into that yet but

716
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:21,418
Kevin mckernan from medicinal genomics

717
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,880
will speak after break and he's going to

718
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,919
talk about some strategies that can be

719
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,679
used from a genetic perspective in the

720
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,620
plant that will allow us to mitigate the

721
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,000
spread of this this particular viroid so

722
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:34,918
I'm going to leave it with with Kevin

723
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,038
and and because we haven't approached

724
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,960
that yet but there is hope I don't want

725
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:42,119
to leave this room with with a doom and

726
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,140
gloom even though it is a very important

727
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,839
disease

728
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,520
it is a severely important disease but

729
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,379
Kevin's going to talk more about the

730
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,720
genetic basis for that

731
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,899
Dr zamir uh thank you very much for your

732
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,600
research just so I understood you uh

733
00:29:54,898 --> 00:30:01,439
with the vercon as a two percent uh

734
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:05,158
solution is it still worthwhile to soak

735
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,798
say pruning shears in the solution prior

736
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,899
um is that still a viable method for

737
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,398
cleaning absolutely any sanitation

738
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:13,739
approach that you take whether it's

739
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:16,379
ethanol bleach or vercon you should

740
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,519
still continue doing I think what I was

741
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,039
trying to mention here was that they

742
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,558
don't destroy the RNA they aren't

743
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:25,379
accurative but they're definitely worth

744
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,658
protecting just like gloves right wash

745
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,000
your hands wear gloves that protects you

746
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,399
protects the plant doesn't eradicate it

747
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,859
so definitely vercon seems to be one of

748
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,959
the best products out there I would say

749
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:39,418
bleach is also pretty good ethanol maybe

750
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,538
not so much but definitely dip the tools

751
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:45,720
on the hands on the surfaces anywhere

752
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:48,058
where the viroid can come into contact

753
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,558
with with the plant surface just a

754
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:51,839
follow-up question what percentage of

755
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,980
bleach would you advise you know I don't

756
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,558
think you want to go more than 10

757
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,940
because it's just so caustic to

758
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,519
everything around you and that's the

759
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,440
problem with bleach and the smell yeah

760
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,259
um 20 would work better but I would

761
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,899
never suggest you do that it's too high

762
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:08,339
thank you

763
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,959
I think there's one there then maybe we

764
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:11,278
can do one before we go for break I'm

765
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,840
going to be around during break as well

766
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,099
so if we need to break we can certainly

767
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:16,859
do that

768
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:18,839
hi Dr punja my name is Bill Graham I'm

769
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:21,959
with microclone tissue culture we've

770
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:25,379
talked online and um I wanted to ask we

771
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,919
promote a uh a cultural program based on

772
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:31,440
Vigor and that is taking tiny uh

773
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:34,679
introduction cuts from the tips of the

774
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,320
very best veg plants every cycle to

775
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,240
create the Next Generation and uh

776
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,398
cleaning the tools and everything in

777
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,259
between with the intent sort of be to

778
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:46,259
capture those small pieces of tissue

779
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:47,819
that would be thyroid free for the

780
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:50,940
circumstance that they had just outgrown

781
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:53,939
the viroid and to prevent back

782
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,340
contamination and it seems to be

783
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,679
reducing the presence in the entire

784
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:01,439
population even if it's just a few

785
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,360
percent at a time over and over and and

786
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,820
your thoughts on that

787
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:07,500
yeah so definitely a combined approach

788
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:09,240
is going to be extremely important so

789
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,579
continuing to use the sanitation

790
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,759
products looking at the mayor stem tips

791
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:17,099
for for propagation now some Growers

792
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:19,619
will will try to use the the uppermost

793
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:22,019
part of the plant uh and use that as

794
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:23,699
opposed to the bottom part what we what

795
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,918
we've seen from our data is that when

796
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,659
the viral gets down into the roots the

797
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,360
first place it goes is actually up to

798
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:32,820
the top of the plant and so taking those

799
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:35,398
cuts for propagation it may not be the

800
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,538
best idea but for meristem growth and

801
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:38,879
for those of you that are not familiar

802
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:40,798
with Mary stems the meristem is a very

803
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,020
very very tiny piece at the top of the

804
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,179
plant and the idea is that as the plant

805
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:47,460
grows the viral it doesn't get all the

806
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:50,159
way up into the top and so by harvesting

807
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,558
that marriage stem you're one step ahead

808
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,600
of the viroid and that's that's the

809
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,278
theory behind it but you got to be

810
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,918
careful because I think testing testing

811
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:00,480
testing is going to be super important

812
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,399
that'll be the next part we'll be

813
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,960
talking to you about the most strategic

814
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,599
testing protocols

815
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,278
so I mean definitely rtpcr is going to

816
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,079
be the method of choice and that's

817
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,500
what's out there right now and there's

818
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,480
many Labs that actually perform the the

819
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,778
diagnostic testing for for hop latent

820
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,538
that's it I I meant the um what tissue

821
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:23,398
oh go ahead uh I'll talk to you later

822
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:26,298
yeah yeah okay well let's let's follow

823
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:26,298
up later thank you

824
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,819
all right thank you
