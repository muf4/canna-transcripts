00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,620
good morning Russ thanks for joining us

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,839
on the podcast

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,679
morning Ben happy to be very happy to be

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,780
here

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,400
all right so I'm excited to talk with

6
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,539
you because I know that you and your

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,120
team you've done a lot of work

8
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,460
evaluating the use of field portable

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,559
testing Technologies on cannabis plants

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,359
which is is pretty exciting and I know

11
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,099
from from our end on the medicinal

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,660
genomic side with some of our testing

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,859
Technologies that's something The

14
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,118
Growers are always interested in

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,340
something that's portable something

16
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,920
that's easy so I'm excited to talk with

17
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,479
you about what you found before we get

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,719
into the specific types of instruments

19
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:39,238
you've evaluated can you set the table

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,760
explain the value of portable testing to

21
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,339
cannabis Growers and why were you and

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,920
your team interested in evaluating them

23
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,359
our first need was a selfish need as a

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,179
breeding program we wanted to be able to

25
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:54,600
select across large populations and the

26
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:56,878
typical GC or hplc platforms were too

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,920
expensive so we started trying to find

28
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,539
methods that were more economical to

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,460
look at a thousand plants instead of

30
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,260
just 10 or 20 plants so our first

31
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,820
interest was selfish to let us get the

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,460
genetic gained breeding selection

33
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,139
efficiency up but then our sponsor noted

34
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,059
very quickly hey dispensaries might want

35
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,118
that other seed companies might want

36
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,920
that and if we can get it good enough on

37
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,260
some of these tools then law enforcement

38
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,299
may want it so it's kind of an expansion

39
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,460
of that that interest

40
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,860
interesting so so you guys are are

41
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,478
breeding plants so what sort of traits

42
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,159
were you looking for and you know how

43
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,478
was some of this technology is helpful

44
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,000
for you

45
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,700
sure well in Texas we're uh one of those

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,459
people you have the 0.3 compliance for

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,000
industrial hemp uh so that was our first

48
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:44,639
first Target tool and we got lower cost

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,780
suitcase hplc systems in place which

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,280
were okay uh but still slow uh and more

51
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,859
than we'd like to pay so the interest

52
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,960
was trying to improve upon a couple of

53
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,840
other near-infrared instruments that are

54
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,938
on the market uh for that kind of a scan

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,340
and we've done that we think and then

56
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:03,959
try to improve selection for things of

57
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,600
interest more for the medical side the

58
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,118
trichomes in particular and then for us

59
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,799
as breeders we wanted to look at varying

60
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,900
the number of chromosomes in a plant so

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,580
deployee I've done that with perennial

62
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,080
grasses before working on hemp and I

63
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,480
think with hemp it has a lot of

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,360
value-added benefits for fiber and Grain

65
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,799
in particular so all three of our our

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,200
instruments we've developed to have

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,819
interest uh to our breeding program in

68
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,479
particular

69
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:32,098
all right excellent so yeah I think I if

70
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,780
you're growing hemp specifically there

71
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,659
is that

72
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,280
requirement that would be under 0.3 talk

73
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,400
a little bit about sort of what's at

74
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,680
stake there or how is that enforced um

75
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,120
are you know could people knock at your

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,560
door and start testing your plants and

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,439
you need to make sure that everything is

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,180
uh compliant uh they can and they have

79
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,400
and those tests have range anywhere from

80
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,080
the presumptive the little color metric

81
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,300
test that law enforcement uses which is

82
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,680
always fun those tests will tell you yes

83
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,000
this is cannabis and we're like well

84
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,879
great we know it's cannabis it's him

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,340
right something with a more diagnostic

86
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,818
test and we get more precise uh but yeah

87
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,860
we we uh abide by those those rules set

88
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:13,018
forth by the state and the federal

89
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,459
government and the Texas department of

90
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,860
Ag and the fun thing for us is a

91
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,819
breeding program is if we know it's hemp

92
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,920
coming in

93
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:21,539
we can breed with it

94
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,059
proceed with generations of selection

95
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,979
for other trades heat tolerance yield

96
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,780
whatever other trade we're interested in

97
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,039
and as long as we don't test for that

98
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,959
compliance we can keep going with

99
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,179
Generations before we ever release

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,819
anything as a cultivar of course we have

101
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,239
to do that but it lets us streamline our

102
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:41,280
Our Generation time

103
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,780
so that's interesting so once you're

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,479
when you're breeding with it you don't

105
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,979
have to continue to keep verifying that

106
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,619
attempt

107
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:52,560
we know the parents were him the project

108
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,599
the progeny May segregate we can select

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,060
the progeny for heat tolerance drought

110
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,818
tolerance height grain size whatever and

111
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,500
we can proceed several generations for a

112
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:03,839
breeding program and then once we decide

113
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,340
to release it as a cultivar then we test

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
those descendants and make sure they're

115
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,580
still compliant but we don't have to

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,658
test every single plant and every single

117
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,019
generation

118
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:13,919
that's interesting but it I mean

119
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,539
theoretically though if you're if you're

120
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,039
starting with hemp and you're breeding

121
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,019
both of them together they're not going

122
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,620
to suddenly turn into cannabis or are

123
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,840
they well that 0.3 is a it's a pretty uh

124
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,720
stringent threshold and you can get

125
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,638
plants that are low in in THC but

126
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,259
they're still above that 0.3 they can be

127
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,699
0.5 put eight or something and that's

128
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,560
happened with material we've looked at

129
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,300
from other regions we brought in

130
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
particularly from Asia some of those

131
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,800
they're below one percent but they're

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,060
not below 0.3 so we have to find the one

133
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,978
the ones that are and still that'll

134
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,199
that'll change with populations as you

135
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:47,579
work with them so there's always a need

136
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,540
to test them before we try to release

137
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,819
anything

138
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,100
yeah okay so yeah so talk a bit about

139
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,918
the the technologies that you're using

140
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,600
to sort of I guess verify that you're

141
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,659
working with hemp given that you know so

142
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,080
much is ex so much is at stake here

143
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,939
sure so we've had populations we know

144
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,560
that are high and low in CBD and our

145
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,740
goal is to get a bell curve from zero

146
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,199
percent to 25 of CBD and we've done the

147
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,819
same thing more recently with the THC

148
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,060
looking for bell curves and once we do

149
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:20,099
that we do two tests we do an hplc

150
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,379
so we know we know within that level of

151
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,720
precision what it is and then we will do

152
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,839
our method of sampling

153
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,880
and Sample preparation and our modified

154
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,579
Optics we use with the near infrared

155
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,139
spectrometer and use that and after that

156
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,899
it's just a matter of having two data

157
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,699
sets and then running the the statistics

158
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,679
and the calibration and the modeling and

159
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:44,280
the validation of those models

160
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,720
okay so so near infrared what is that

161
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,099
and how is it different from you know

162
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,500
hplc

163
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,300
sure it's reflectance but it's

164
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,279
reflecting light that we cannot see it's

165
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,978
a it's a faster wavelength than what we

166
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,839
see we see this UltraViolets down here

167
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:00,538
infrared is up here above it we don't

168
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,279
see it uh and some of the infrared gives

169
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:04,918
us heat signatures some of it gives us

170
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,079
other information but it's all based on

171
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,120
the fact that if you hit something with

172
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,918
that it's going to reflect back other

173
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,600
wavelengths and that's based on the

174
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,819
vibration of the electrons in these

175
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,639
molecules and the fun thing is if you're

176
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,199
looking at uh cannabis you can look at

177
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,519
particular molecules and they're going

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,100
to reflect different amounts of that

179
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,978
infrared the trick is really trying to

180
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,539
be as precise as possible it's it's been

181
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,099
shown before you can get to two or three

182
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:31,560
percent accuracy but that's not all that

183
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,539
great our goal has been to get below one

184
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,560
percent accuracy

185
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:38,879
and have you met that goal uh we have we

186
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,280
haven't we haven't quite breached that

187
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,100
0.3 we're approaching that and really

188
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,478
that's it's really uh the limitation is

189
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,460
we are

190
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:51,240
a breeding and genetics program we are

191
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,680
not a micro fabricator so there's

192
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,840
certain things with engineering we can't

193
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,459
do in my lab so we need to reach out to

194
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,959
other Engineers to do some fabrication

195
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,239
and once we can fabricate certain

196
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,818
components to certain levels of

197
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,579
precision at that stage then we can get

198
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,319
there I think okay so that's a that's a

199
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:10,579
good point of clarification here so are

200
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,840
you using sort of commercially available

201
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:14,698
Technologies and just sort of evaluating

202
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,959
how they work are you developing your

203
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,300
own

204
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,739
so the spectrometer we use is a handheld

205
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,720
spectrometer you can buy it off the

206
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,038
shelf

207
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,560
that's where it ends for off-the-shelf

208
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,180
methods the sampling method that we use

209
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,620
is different than what's out there so if

210
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,000
you're familiar with a little purple or

211
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,620
if you're familiar with the gem assert

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,779
those are both near infrared devices

213
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,418
they get you a little bit of information

214
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,339
but not that accurate so the

215
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:41,038
spectrometer is off the shelf it's small

216
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:43,258
and the cool thing is in the future your

217
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,240
iPhone your iPhone 25 is going to have a

218
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,560
near infrared spectrometer on it they

219
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,019
demonstrated they could put it on cell

220
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,180
phones back in 2016. so the technology

221
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:53,579
is there it's just a matter of putting

222
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,860
it in there but the Optics so the same

223
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,079
thing we do is a bit different and the

224
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,639
Optics is different in two ways that's

225
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,918
where we have our proprietary little

226
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,360
little widget with it the Optics are

227
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,579
different than both of those systems it

228
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,800
lets us be more accurate and then the

229
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:09,779
modeling we do is is similar to what's

230
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,879
been done for near infrared for other

231
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,758
Industries using infrared for forage

232
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,339
evaluation for all sorts of molecules so

233
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,680
the the equations the modeling and

234
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,359
validation is similar but it still ends

235
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,759
up being a bit unique for the

236
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,319
cannabinoids

237
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,979
excellent

238
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,598
um

239
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:29,839
now I forgot what I was going to ask

240
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:29,839
next

241
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,759
um so how difficult is are these

242
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:37,979
instruments to use like could the could

243
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,379
the average grower conceivably use this

244
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,479
reliably and get repeatable results

245
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,338
absolutely everything I do I repeat it

246
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,240
three times on every sample and you can

247
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:49,800
do uh one sample in about 30 seconds and

248
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,480
by the time you by the time you run the

249
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,059
analysis is still less than a minute so

250
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,580
from sampling uh to running the Optics

251
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,319
to doing the the analytics on it once

252
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,060
it's once it's all put together it can

253
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,278
be done in one minute or less we've got

254
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,500
it it's almost a two component system

255
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,259
right now it's just a matter of turning

256
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,778
a tool from proof of concept to

257
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,179
something that's more ergonomic uh and

258
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:14,220
and user friendly but the goal is to

259
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:18,419
make it to where anyone can use it

260
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,720
excellent and now how important is

261
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,979
at what stage of development in the

262
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,500
plant you're testing like are you

263
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,300
testing you know finished dried cured uh

264
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,100
flour or are you kind of testing it

265
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:32,939
throughout its life

266
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,800
sure so it gets back to uh we started

267
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,779
testing at week zero of flowering when

268
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,519
you know before us everything try comes

269
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:40,679
there and we start looking at every

270
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,778
three or four days so we went week zero

271
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,000
one two three four and five and really

272
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:47,519
there's not even with hpoc there's not a

273
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,440
lot of appreciable uh cannabinoids until

274
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,000
about week two of flowering sure

275
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,519
somewhere between week two and week

276
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,379
three you start to see it going up uh so

277
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,299
our goal has been to to calibrate it

278
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,179
starting in that period so any anything

279
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:02,639
from about week two and a half until a

280
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:05,039
finished flower we can we can sample and

281
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,319
quantify and the Beautiful point you

282
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,819
made was unlike the little purple and

283
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,480
hemisphere which require you to have

284
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,440
dried cured tissue which you grind up we

285
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,899
can do

286
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
dried or fresh tissue

287
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,259
thanks for that that's been a beautiful

288
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,339
gain for us to do things out in the

289
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,338
field on living plants

290
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:28,200
um all right I and now you mentioned you

291
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,580
know this is just one of I think three

292
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,339
different technologies that you are

293
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,139
evaluating correct is that correct sure

294
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,260
we've moved a lot into microelectronics

295
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:39,000
I guess since we uh applied to be a

296
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:40,559
participant in this conference we've got

297
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,240
a fourth device as well and we're on the

298
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,399
five percent but we'll throw that fiber

299
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,959
device out but the first one we started

300
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,379
using was everyone wanted to look at the

301
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,458
trichomes and it's pretty simple to add

302
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,439
a small

303
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,239
little microscope attachment onto your

304
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,740
cell phone now and there are some of

305
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,500
those that can get up to four or 600

306
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,600
magnification they're very clear so that

307
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,039
one's been kind of a fun little freebie

308
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,959
gimme it'll probably be open source

309
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,899
where you're just combining a cell phone

310
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,299
based microscope small attachment with

311
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,480
image processing so image J or some

312
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:14,278
other version of that that will do a few

313
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,500
things it will it will identify the

314
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,379
round pieces the diameter it'll classify

315
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,360
the trichome heads once it classifies

316
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,700
them it will get the diameter and the

317
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,100
volume that will give you the basic size

318
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,540
of it and they were also still in the

319
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,700
process but working at getting the color

320
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,259
of it so looking at the pixel color so

321
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,339
we can gauge maturity so the goal of

322
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,740
that one is just going to be an open

323
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,959
source cell phone attachment and an app

324
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,459
where you can use that and look at your

325
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,919
trichome and say this is how big it is

326
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,419
this is how mature it is so that's kind

327
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,299
of a fun open source thing it's been

328
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,338
undergraduates and graduates the third

329
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,500
device has been getting back to the the

330
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:53,100
increase in chromosome numbers so the

331
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,600
ploidy if if you think about cells if

332
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,159
you increase the DNA in those you

333
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,480
increase the amount of protein you

334
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,860
increase the amount of everything that's

335
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,740
involved with it in Plants you increase

336
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,300
the cell wall size so for fiber hemp

337
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,980
we're very interested in trying to see

338
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,620
if we can make the best and the herd

339
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,240
fiber in particular longer by extending

340
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,278
that cell wall and by doing the

341
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,320
chromosome doubling we now have a lot of

342
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,700
plants that are tetraploid they don't

343
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,980
have two sets of chromosomes they have

344
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,560
four

345
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:23,039
and those we have now confirmed can have

346
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:24,899
improved fiber and improve grain but to

347
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,759
do the classification is very difficult

348
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,139
after you hit them with the treatment to

349
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,519
induce a chromosome doubling you have to

350
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,220
figure out which ones have been doubled

351
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,200
the plants to the visual eye don't look

352
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,079
that different and the typical tool has

353
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,839
been used is called a flow cytometer it

354
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:42,599
is a capillary system it's based on Cell

355
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,240
sorting and for cannabis which is a

356
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,180
resin resinous crop you've got lots of

357
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,039
sticky things in that extract and you

358
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,078
put that through these capillaries and

359
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,939
just block locks it up it plugs up and

360
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,919
you just ruin the capillary systems in

361
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,540
your flow cytometer so if you can't do

362
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,039
that your lift what you're left with

363
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,379
looking at chromosomes under a

364
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,879
microscope which is long and tedious

365
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,278
or trying to use some kind of indirect

366
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,620
measure and what we're coming up with is

367
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,720
not a capillary system but a

368
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,220
microfluidic system everything is going

369
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,379
Micron everything is eventually going to

370
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,639
go Nano but taking the capillary system

371
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,860
and making it smaller you go to

372
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,839
microfluidic channels and once we do

373
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:22,440
that we're using these these small flow

374
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,000
cells to separate the cells and the fun

375
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,680
thing is if it's got four sets of

376
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,720
chromosomes it moves slower

377
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,179
if it's got two sets it moves faster so

378
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,860
it's just like hplc or GC you're just

379
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:34,439
flow sorting in that microfluiding

380
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,180
channel so

381
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,700
when we have that it's just a matter of

382
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,138
running a modif that fluidic channel and

383
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,579
then looking at the speed of movement of

384
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,259
them across that and we can estimate

385
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,539
whether they have had the chromosomes

386
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:47,939
doubled or not

387
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:51,120
all right no all right so a lot there

388
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,899
first thing as a as someone who has

389
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,700
dabbled with home growing

390
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,839
unsuccessfully I think I've given up but

391
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,399
one of the things I always struggled

392
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,740
with was the thing you mentioned about

393
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,078
trichomes is you know looking with that

394
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,079
magnifying glass is it milky is it not

395
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,458
so a tool like that I think would be

396
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,799
very valuable

397
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,939
um at least for for people who are on my

398
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,620
level

399
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,000
well my goal is to have either a video

400
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,259
of us doing it or actually have

401
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,700
something there in hand that we can

402
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,338
demonstrate during the during the

403
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,320
conference uh and just do live demos if

404
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,519
we can't do videos of it but yeah that

405
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,260
would be the one that we would bring

406
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
there with us and have for people to

407
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,838
play with and work with I think that

408
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,778
would be uh

409
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,639
perfect for anyone homeowners dispensary

410
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:35,399
breeders sea companies for those

411
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,278
trichomes excellent and now the

412
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,860
tetraploid which is really interesting

413
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,240
um we had a presenter at our last can

414
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,339
make

415
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,039
at our last cam Med Seth Crawford

416
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,199
talking about triploid genomics and some

417
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,120
of the value that comes with that so so

418
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,519
that's three sets obviously and this is

419
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,320
four so you mentioned some of the the

420
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,480
advantages there being you know better

421
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,660
fiber and grain

422
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,940
um now I know with with triploid that

423
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:04,500
makes the plant actually sterile or you

424
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,880
know that it can't reproduce same thing

425
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,980
for tetraploid or can you actually

426
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,958
breathe with those no no no trip we have

427
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,459
triploids as well I guess Oregon CBD

428
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,679
demonstrated triploids and others have

429
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:16,078
done it but basically you you take the

430
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,578
diploid and double it so you have one

431
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,198
parent with two sets and one with four

432
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:20,939
and you cross them you end up you want

433
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,039
with three that's your triploids and

434
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,019
that's a beautiful plant for marijuana

435
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,480
or drug types where you're going to be

436
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,519
cloning vegetatively or even some of

437
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,539
your higher value CBD which is kind of

438
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,879
questionable now if you're really going

439
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,679
to be colonly propagating CD CBD hemp

440
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,299
but triploids are beautiful for those

441
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,219
systems because they're steriles just

442
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:40,019
like seedless bananas seedless

443
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,699
watermelons seedless grapes those are

444
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,480
all triploids for the same reason you

445
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:49,198
have sterility so for certain uses the

446
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,039
triploids are interesting for us it's

447
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,419
more interesting to look at the

448
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,759
tetraploids that have four sets because

449
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,860
they are fertile you can get seed off of

450
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,379
those you can get grain and what we've

451
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,500
seen so far you can get larger grain

452
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:04,559
excellent so would you say that that

453
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,740
technology would be less useful for your

454
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:11,879
average grower unless they were going to

455
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,100
try to breed for tetraploid specifically

456
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,198
maybe most likely but I guess we are lab

457
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,940
we do some things for service and we

458
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:20,099
don't really charge much for them so

459
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,040
we've improved the method of chromosome

460
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,659
doubling so I could see a time where

461
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,480
if people want to do that they could

462
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,338
send us hemp seed and if things changed

463
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,959
into some other seed we can do the

464
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,240
actual treatment of double chromosomes

465
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,739
and confirm it and send you back your

466
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,459
tetravoid version of your favorite

467
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,778
strain or your favorite home variety

468
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:41,399
eventually I don't know it could be a

469
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:43,259
point where people do it both steps

470
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,320
themselves but we would have to sell

471
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,759
that microfluidic uh device which is

472
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,440
kind of a goal is to be able to sell it

473
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,060
but making that simple enough for

474
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,579
homeowners you raise a very good

475
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:55,138
question I'm not not sure yeah maybe not

476
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,120
so much for home Growers but you know

477
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,519
maybe your commercial cultivators who

478
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,379
want to get into that

479
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,480
um yeah and maybe that's a good segue

480
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:04,980
talk a bit more about some of the

481
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,860
different services and things that you

482
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,860
do over there at Texas A M

483
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,659
sure we do uh control crosses so we have

484
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:15,178
companies sending OC and they want us to

485
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,040
make specific Cross by cross and the fun

486
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,459
thing we've developed that isn't really

487
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,959
part of this abstract uh with cannabis

488
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,939
you really want to control the males and

489
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,380
the pollen yep and the industry

490
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,360
typically tries to put them in different

491
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,460
rooms so you end up sacrificing the

492
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,798
entire room for one pollinator one male

493
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,500
and we've developed what is called a

494
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,660
pollen control tent or a pollen you know

495
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,160
pollen containment tent and there's one

496
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,960
company in the UK that makes these and

497
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,640
they're very expensive and we've made

498
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,980
our own version and basically the the

499
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,660
mesh around it lets enough light through

500
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,400
the plant as happy it grows just fine

501
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,380
you get you get gas exchange there's

502
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,080
enough air in there but it's small

503
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,880
enough mesh it's less than one micron it

504
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,220
keeps the pollen from getting in or out

505
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,140
and cannabis Pawn is about 25 microns

506
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,779
this screen is less than one micron

507
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,220
what's that let us do we can put two

508
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,200
parents we want to cross in there a

509
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,460
female and a male no other pawns going

510
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,880
to get on that female or set the pollen

511
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,500
from the male you want and it can't leak

512
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,360
pollen and contaminate other plants you

513
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,798
have so as a result we have a green

514
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,959
analysis three thousand square feet

515
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:19,980
we're not using all of it yet and we are

516
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,500
currently increasing seed on 120 crosses

517
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,079
so instead of having 120 rooms one for

518
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,058
each cross we now have one modest sized

519
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,159
Greenhouse where we're doing hundreds of

520
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:30,839
individual crosses of different size

521
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,419
sometimes we do a single plant and we

522
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,740
inbreed it sometimes we do two or three

523
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,038
plants for synthetic hybrids and

524
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,440
sometimes we do populations in these but

525
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,240
uh it's been a beautiful tool wow that's

526
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,880
interesting so so you have the male and

527
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,319
the female under 110. we can do that and

528
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,240
the fun thing we've learned we can make

529
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,159
the female into a hermaphrodite make it

530
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,660
monicious or it has male and female

531
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,519
flowers we've learned how to work with

532
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,640
that so we can make a single female

533
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,558
plant pollinate itself so you can breed

534
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,120
it and we've learned more recently you

535
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,460
can make a male plant produce female

536
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,798
flowers and we've started selfing those

537
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,660
so in your crazy wild mind you might

538
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,099
think of an all-male cultivar instead of

539
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,860
feminized seed you might have masculine

540
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:12,859
ice seed for fiber nail plants in

541
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,659
general have better fiber quality

542
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:17,038
so our goal is to start doing some of

543
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,179
the inbreeding services that people want

544
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,679
us to do that as well but we can make

545
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:22,100
crosses for people different types of

546
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,100
crosses

547
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,899
for service and we can do the chromosome

548
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,819
doubling that that's also a service we

549
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,740
we have listed and really anything that

550
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,178
we get permission to do from the

551
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,880
University and the Texas department of

552
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,160
AG we can use it we can provide it as a

553
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,780
service and when you do that you send a

554
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,120
seed we get no IP we're just doing a

555
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:44,099
service you give us your seed we give

556
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,418
you seed back and you do whatever you

557
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,399
like with it

558
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,919
right no and you mentioned permission

559
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,780
and in regulation so you again you can

560
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,059
only work with hemp correct

561
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:55,500
so far yes we had to give approval from

562
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:57,899
the University and from the Texas

563
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,880
department of AG or TDA once we do that

564
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,700
any any project we propose and get

565
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,440
approved uh we've got green lights

566
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,720
and now what is the limiting factor

567
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,019
there is it Federal Regulation or state

568
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,579
like so for example if Texas were to go

569
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:13,079
um full adult use

570
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:14,759
um would that open things up for you or

571
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,918
is kind of the Federal Regulation

572
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,160
holding you back

573
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,559
that is a beautiful question so it would

574
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,240
be able pay grade sure yeah that would

575
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,160
be out to the department head or the

576
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,679
dean or the vice Chancellor because

577
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,538
actually the the the hemp research

578
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,700
license that we have is not me I'm just

579
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:35,220
a lowly faculty member uh it's actually

580
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,019
signed by our Dean so it's up to the

581
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,839
Comfort level of the dean if if I think

582
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,000
if the state approved made it legal uh

583
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,740
the TDA would give us a research or was

584
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,960
legal but it would still be a question

585
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,940
of whether our director and Dean would

586
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,279
let us do it so I think if we did that

587
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,919
uh we could we could do so and really

588
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,960
our Administration has been very uh

589
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,400
helpful they've not been setting up

590
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,558
Roblox they've not been saying we can't

591
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,940
do things they just said be compliant

592
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,038
and be careful

593
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,080
excellent

594
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:05,279
um I want to talk a bit about your your

595
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,740
background because I was reading your

596
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,200
bio before I I jumped on with you um you

597
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,880
know you didn't start in cannabis so

598
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,160
talk a bit about what you did before and

599
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,600
and what made you switch sure no I

600
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,919
actually started in Biochemistry and

601
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,079
then I went in the Army so I went

602
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,179
non-traditional came back to the Army

603
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,819
and got into plant sciences and really

604
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:26,280
uh I've been a grass breeder a perennial

605
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:28,139
grass breeder for over 15 years now and

606
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,519
I teach classes I always say I used to

607
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,280
always say I was the grass reader but

608
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,500
not the grass breeder three years ago

609
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,019
until or two and a half years ago Texas

610
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,779
greenlighted him and by that time I had

611
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,700
learned to use certain terpenes some are

612
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:44,460
from Cannabis some are from other plants

613
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,400
that have helped myself friends and

614
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,860
families for specific conditions so I

615
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,620
had a love for terpenes uh

616
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,538
from a nutraceutical standpoint and we

617
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:57,119
started looking at terpenes as trying to

618
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:58,798
make plasticizers of fibers to try to

619
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,239
work replacing some of these Plastics so

620
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,158
we kind of jumped into different bio

621
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,099
products as well with the grasses

622
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,260
because I had a job after my PhD turning

623
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:08,699
grass fiber into ethanol so trying to

624
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,038
not use cornstarch but trying to use

625
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,779
cellulose so I already had kind of an

626
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,058
interest in the terpenes and an interest

627
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,918
in the bile products and the fun thing

628
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:19,558
with him when it when it was legalized

629
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,240
to me you cannot make one thing or two

630
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:23,339
things you can make six or seven things

631
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,279
and if you have six or seven Commodities

632
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:28,740
off of one crop no one major company or

633
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,960
industry can shut you down when I was

634
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,279
working on ethanol corn ethanol they

635
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,019
always kept their margin and nickel

636
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,038
shorter than us every time we got ours a

637
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,379
little cheaper they made theirs even

638
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,900
cheaper so one Energy company could shut

639
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,720
us down with industrial hemp and

640
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,038
cannabis no one no one industry can do

641
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,298
that when you've got fiber you've got

642
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:46,679
grain you've got terpenes you've got

643
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:50,759
cannabinoids you've got all the bile

644
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,620
products so it's a beautiful crop to use

645
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:54,240
as a biorefinery I guess that's that's

646
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:56,639
my love for it

647
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,859
excellent and yeah with so many

648
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,440
different uses you need to be able to

649
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:02,759
you know breed optimally right and I

650
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,519
know you have some experience with

651
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,259
marker assisted breeding so what are

652
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,298
some of the traits or markers that

653
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,819
you're interested in or you think could

654
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,500
be you know the future

655
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:14,939
so there's a sorority markers for male

656
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,880
versus female there's already markers

657
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,380
for a CBD and THC the markers we're

658
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,140
really after for Texas in the southern

659
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,700
us are heat and drought most of the

660
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,020
varieties from Europe and Colorado just

661
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,580
do terrible down here particularly

662
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:28,798
Central Texas and further south and

663
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:30,899
it'll be the same going to Florida all

664
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,339
the way across the southern U.S so we're

665
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,559
really trying to focus on heat and

666
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:36,000
drought but other fun things are going

667
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,038
to be modified trichomes you know

668
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,859
there's interest in making a fiber and

669
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,000
grain type that has no cannabinoids at

670
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,459
that point it would be considered a type

671
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,558
5 hemp and that would be something that

672
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,419
would make Farmers not worry about it

673
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,220
being compliant that would make parents

674
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,559
not worry about milk having any residues

675
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,940
in them and it would give uh give the

676
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,960
DEA headaches because they couldn't try

677
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,600
to regulate there would be no schedule

678
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,798
one molecule in it so we could argue for

679
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,798
a different type of

680
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,279
classification of that

681
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,379
and the other thing we're

682
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,879
atrogenetically really is uniformity if

683
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,860
you look at Industrial Hemp on a big

684
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,500
acreage the plants are all over the map

685
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:13,500
for flowering for branching for size and

686
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,779
height we're trying to get cannabis to

687
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,058
be grown just like modern corn modern

688
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,399
major crops where you have completely

689
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:21,960
100 percent in breadline parents so

690
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,940
they're uniform you can propagate them

691
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,079
by sea just like rice or wheat you plant

692
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,298
the seed it looks just like the parent

693
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,678
you can't do that with cannabis now it

694
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:31,139
varies that's why it's all clonely

695
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,960
propagated but once we have in red lines

696
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,480
we can cross those and the f1s should be

697
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,980
larger they should have hybrid Vigor and

698
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,538
where no one's really confirmed that

699
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,380
we're going to take the risk and see if

700
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:45,298
we can and we've got uh

701
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,159
several pipelines going to make inbreds

702
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,500
so we should buy this time next year be

703
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,640
able to say yes you can inbreed to the

704
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,339
fifth or sixth generation to make

705
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,259
hybrids or or no you can't

706
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:57,178
well that's exciting that could be uh

707
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,599
that could be yet next year is can Med

708
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,600
topic

709
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,859
so so winding down here so I mean if

710
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,120
Growers are listening and they're kind

711
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:07,319
of excited by these different

712
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,219
technologies that you're putting

713
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,779
together

714
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,240
um you know are these going to be

715
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:14,460
available to them like how is that um

716
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,099
how is that process kind of work

717
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,019
we have a timeline you know I I'm

718
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:21,178
academius I'm way out of industry for

719
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,558
over a decade more than a decade now but

720
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,240
I'm very cognitive of trying to get

721
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,500
things pre-commercial or have some kind

722
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,778
of a commercial timeline particularly

723
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,079
for our sponsor and I guess the three we

724
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:33,179
have listed for this this program uh the

725
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:35,519
open source microscope to look at

726
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,080
trichomes and classify that should be

727
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,200
available this year so by the end of

728
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,119
2023 and that'll be easy the second one

729
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,120
is the nir platform which we've now

730
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:47,579
confirmed with utility for CBD and Delta

731
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,959
nine so we've got two of those and

732
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,819
that's really up to our sponsors so they

733
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,860
have the right to commercialize it as

734
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:55,918
they desire so it's that'll be

735
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:57,599
commercialized at their timeline it's

736
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,038
been it's been it's been disclosed it's

737
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,139
been released to them it's a matter of

738
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,720
how quickly they want to commercialize

739
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,460
it the third one for the DNA content

740
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,038
which may have a smaller audience not as

741
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,038
many people wanted to buy it that one

742
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:13,019
maybe a little further out but it was

743
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,980
still either be this year or next year

744
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:18,240
2023 or 2024. all right excellent and do

745
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,038
we want to give us a plug to your

746
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,558
sponsor real quick

747
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:25,619

749
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:31,319
company is rare earth genomics

750
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,960
based out of Texas and Houston

751
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:35,519

the listeners might be interested in if

755
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,038
they're you know interested in learning

756
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:45,480
more or reading up on some of the things

757
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:47,759
that we talked about I can always put

758
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,500
links into the show description

759
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,079
um that they can learn more and then

760
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,700
also please plug your your program or

761
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,740
you if you're on social media anything

762
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,298
like that so that people can learn more

763
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,038
about you and the work that your team's

764
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,960
doing

765
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,879
so I'm old enough my only social media

766
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,440
is LinkedIn but LinkedIn we do have

767
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,000
things we haven't talked about we've got

768
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,278
a conversion program you talked about

769
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,019
home grows we're taking donations and

770
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,058
making any donation of pollen we get

771
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:13,200
into compliant hemp and we're going to

772
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:14,700
release that so we're going to have a

773
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,919
public open source term plasma

774
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,840
collection uh start to come out this

775
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,580
year and it's called The Hemp conversion

776
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,259
programs that's on our LinkedIn or my

777
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:25,199
LinkedIn page if you just search

778
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:26,759
LinkedIn for hemp conversion program I

779
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,019
got a Federal grant to help expand it so

780
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,658
it's going to be bigger by next year

781
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:32,400
that's a fun one we have other products

782
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,480
going on so if they have interest you

783
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,700
know if anyone has interest in other

784
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,380
ideas or other bio products we're more

785
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,640
than happy to visit and develop those

786
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,860
ideas

787
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,600
all right all right thanks again Russ

788
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,699
for taking the time to be on the podcast

789
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,339
and I look forward to seeing you down in

790
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:50,298
Florida
