2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,719
So you know researchers they could

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,719
develop their own sort of their own

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,919
trial.

5
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:27,719
That is exactly right Benjamin. We

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,118
created some let me call it standardized

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,839
master EEG research protocol that has

8
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,439
been approved by health Canada and have

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,600
been approved multiple times by

10
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,238
different independent ethnic research

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,280
boards. But the beauty of our

12
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:46,399
standardized research protocol is that

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,558
it enables our partners because we don't

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,160
only do research in our lab. we are

15
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,558
implementing this technology in other

16
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,519
labs and research hospitals is that they

17
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:59,320
can customize you know this this

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,520
protocol. They can typically what we do

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,239
is EEG's recordings before the

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,079
intervention or consumption of a product

21
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,719
and then after the consumption of the

22
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:14,640
product. So after the after consumption

23
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:18,478
recordings are completely customizable.

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,400
You can do many EEGs scans or recordings

25
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,118
right at the beginning, the first 30

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,600
minutes if your objective is to capture

27
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,920
the the onset time as accurately as

28
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,839
possible. Think about as resolution,

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,040
right? The more samples, the higher the

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,680
resolution to see how that evolves. But

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
also you can do it, you know, you can

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,439
just record the EEG of a study subjects

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,240
and map that product experience for up

34
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:48,719
to 30 minutes or 45 minutes or 1 hour or

35
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:51,158
3 hours or up to five hours etc. Right?

36
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,478
H you you can you

37
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:58,640
know customize that according to the

38
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:01,718
needs of the needs and objectives of the

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,000
company or research organization that is

40
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:06,399
conducting research in this in this

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
field. Yeah. And I have to imagine this

42
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,038
being you know AI and machine learning

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,719
the more data that folks are generating

44
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,639
it's just going to feed into the system

45
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,719
and just improve it. Correct. Exactly. I

46
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,079
mean it's it's just it's just like a

47
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,400
snowball because the more data we

48
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,680
collect the more AI will continue

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,439
learning and and and I think that we

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,760
will get to a point where the PL metric

51
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,479
will not only measure you know the high

52
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,439
and you know how strong is that effect

53
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,679
etc. It will it will also tell us what

54
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,959
type of high you are experiencing. Are

55
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,640
you experiencing the body high or the

56
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,439
head high or what hallucinations I don't

57
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,639
know etc. I think that it will get to

58
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:57,280
that level of accuracy and even better I

59
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,079
think that it will get to a point where

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,479
we will be able to personalize it. So

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
imagine that at a certain point and I

62
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,158
want to be one of the first ones to say

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,800
it because I really think it will happen

64
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,199
is that these devices will become you

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,519
know gadgets for consumers where you

66
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,399
will be able to wear it. It will read

67
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,879
your brain waves and will know who you

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,239
are what type of what type of brain you

69
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:26,000
are and based on that you will tell this

70
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,878
app hey you know I I want to relax

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,479
today. Okay, you are this type of brain,

72
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,518
you want to relax. These are the type of

73
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,598
products that you should consume and

74
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,280
this is how you should consume them. I I

75
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:43,359
think that that that will be the one of

76
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,400
the late latest stages of adoptions uh

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,680
of adoption of wearable EG technology

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,560
and AI for for these types of consumer

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,319
package good markets like personalized

80
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,199
recommendations of product used to

81
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,359
accomplish an experience. Yeah, I mean I

82
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,839
can definitely I can definitely see a

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,840
future with that.

84
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:16,280
