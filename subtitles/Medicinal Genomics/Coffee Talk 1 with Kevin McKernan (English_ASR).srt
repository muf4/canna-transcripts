00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,240
welcome to the can med coffee talk

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,219
podcast will be talked with the leading

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,859
minds in cannabis science medicine

5
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:19,050
cultivation and safety testing who will

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,970
be part of the can med 2020 conference

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,960
in Pasadena California

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:26,969
this September 20th through 22nd we have

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,289
a great episode for you today as I had

10
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,259
the chance to talk with medicinal

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,960
genomics chief scientific officer Kevin

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,850
mckernon kevin is a legend in genomic

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,878
sequencing going back to his days

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,379
working on the human genome project he

15
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,210
has applied his experience and knowledge

16
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:44,729
to trying to better understand the

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,590
cannabis genome which as he mentions in

18
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,288
our conversation is one of the hardest

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,120
genomes to figure out so much so that

20
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,250
many of the top minds in genetic

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,729
sequencing have collaborated to try to

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,378
solve this cannabis genome problem and I

23
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:00,628
think you'll see from our conversation

24
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,299
that collaboration is something that

25
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:05,670
Kevin is very passionate about so it's

26
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,590
no surprise then that Kevin and the team

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,049
at medicinal genomics and at that time

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,868
core gene life sciences came up with the

29
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,490
idea for the can med conference to

30
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,438
provide a place where cannabis

31
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,629
researchers and clinicians could come

32
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,629
together share their data and learn from

33
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,339
one another and if you'd like to learn

34
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:26,129
from the leading minds and cannabis

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,259
science cultivation medicine and safety

36
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:32,069
testing you should definitely join us at

health crisis has certainly changed life

54
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,759
at can med events and medicinal

55
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:18,819
and for me personally as I record this

56
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,889
from my home by the way I apologize in

57
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,340
advance if any ambient noise from my

58
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:26,019
children finds its way into the podcast

59
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,939

64
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,039
factors play into purchasing a ticket

00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:39,389
I get to my conversation with Kevin we

89
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,330
do have a sponsor for today's podcast

90
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:45,729
PacBio sequencing technology matters and

91
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,850
PacBio gets cannabis sequencing right

92
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:52,149
with easy to use workflows long reads

93
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:54,819
and high accuracy PacBio provides the

94
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,599
tools to gain a complete view of genetic

95
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:02,530
diversity for more information go to Pak

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:05,169
b.com so without any further ado here's

97
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,629
my conversation with Kevin mckernon

98
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:10,379
chief scientific officer of medicinal

99
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,379
genomics

100
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:24,628
[Music]

101
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,449
hello Kevin thanks for joining us thanks

102
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:29,310
for having me Ben yeah I figured it

103
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,800
would be fitting to have you as our

104
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,259
first guest since you've been so heavily

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,389
heavily involved in kid med since its

106
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,490
inception so maybe we should start with

107
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,848
you kind of telling the story about how

108
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:45,120
can med came to be wow there's a long

109
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:47,098
story there and it um it actually drive

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,050
to think from a lot of the the the

111
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:51,509
parents that had children that are being

112
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,509
treated in this kind of split medical

113
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:55,979
care system we have we've got nine I

114
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:57,509
think this was presented a can med last

115
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:01,019
year that only nine percent of

116
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:03,060
physicians are educated on the ECS and

117
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:04,378
yet we've got a lot of people that in

118
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,418
the cannabis space have been forced to

119
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,669
practice medicine and circumstances

120
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,198
whether either uncertified or you know

121
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:12,508
don't don't have access to all the tools

122
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,699
in the medical care system so it creates

123
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,250
a really challenging environment for

124
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:21,030
parents who are obviously in oftentimes

125
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,459
having to use both systems both the the

126
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,288
current Western medicine while also

127
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,788
seeking you know caregivers and other

128
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:29,490
folks who are professionals and making

129
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:32,218
some of these oils so that up that kind

130
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,689
of a scientific apartheid system that

131
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:36,629
has occurred due to prohibition has

132
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,519
really created a need for physicians to

133
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,740
educate many people in the cannabis

134
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,758
field about the things we need to worry

135
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,620
about and treating a lot of these

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,449
complex diseases at the same time for

137
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,189
those physicians to learn from people in

138
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,650
the cannabis field that have been making

139
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:53,339
these products sort of under the table

140
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:55,679
for the last 80 years so we've always

141
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,598
found that you know the division of

142
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,949
labor makes people hyper specialized and

143
00:05:57,598 --> 00:06:01,348
oftentimes the most productive

144
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:03,360
interactions are cross-disciplinary when

145
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:05,098
you get together minds of people who are

146
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
doing growing and people who are doing

147
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,250
at a local chemistry they're not always

148
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,019
speaking the same language of people

149
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,509
doing genomics or people that are that

150
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,310
are practicing medicine so getting them

151
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:16,590
all together to share notes is

152
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,399
extraordinarily important right now and

153
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:22,079
that's kind of the spirit II can med I

154
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,489
think you're absolutely right it it

155
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,008
seems like the the conference really

156
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,098
started with a real medical focus given

157
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,810
the fact that medicinal genomics is

158
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,500
still hard to coordinate courtesan at

159
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,389
that pole

160
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,550
but the conference has really grown to

161
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,680
include more of those other disciplines

162
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,490
like you had mentioned being cultivation

163
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,290
and laboratory testing so it's become a

164
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:47,699
very important event for the community

165
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:50,220
would you agree I would definitely agree

166
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,959
and and you know the initial conferences

167
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,640
were definitely more medically ridden

168
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,069
encourage everybody to go and look at

169
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,269
some of those those presentations you

170
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:58,649
guys have done great job keeping them

171
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:00,000
all online so you can kind of see the

172
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:02,250
history but it was really early in the

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,810
early days to demonstrate the medical

174
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,740
need and so that you'll see a lot of

175
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,329
patient examples and stories that are

176
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,639
brought out early on with some of the

177
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,889
physicians sharing their notes on how

178
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,319
those progressed and then as it's grown

179
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,939
there's been an interest in you know

180
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,319
more monies coming to the space more

181
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,889
tool providers or more comfortable

182
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,779
working in the space so now we're seeing

183
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:26,969
multinational companies come in that are

184
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,529
sponsoring the event to you know show

185
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,550
off mass spec equipment or the latest

186
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:33,659
genomic tools or even some of the

187
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,220
advances in the agricultural sector and

188
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,260
and all of these you're gonna play a

189
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,940
role because the cost of the medicine we

190
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,620
clearly want to come down prohibition

191
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,000
has clearly been elevating that price

192
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,560
for some time and it's only going to

193
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,660
come down if we can really drive yield

194
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,649
and efficiency in the process and that

195
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,330
requires a multidisciplinary approach

196
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:53,069
absolutely and so speaking of

197
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,750
presentations I wanted to talk a bit

198
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:59,099
about what I assume you're gonna be

199
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:00,660
presenting about at canva 2020 I mean if

200
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,740
we look back the last two years you know

201
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,810
2018 we use kind of introduced this this

202
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,250
project to create a new reference genome

203
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,860
and talked about how it was funded

204
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,810
through - and everything and then 2019

205
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,520
we got another update about sort of that

206
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,319
project and how it was progressing and I

207
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,169
know you have a lot of new and exciting

208
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,849
information to share about the research

209
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,110
you've dug to the cannabis genome so

210
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,060
it's wonder if you could talk a bit

211
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,160
about that yeah so a lot of things have

212
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,720
changed radically in the sequencing

213
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,150
space in the last few years it's really

214
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,830
coincided with cannabis becoming legal

215
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,389
which has been quite remarkable to see

216
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:34,949
there there are these new long read

217
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,840
sequencers I mean they've been out for a

218
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,840
while but they really the long read

219
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,610
sequencers have really been hampered by

220
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,590
their error rates they're not that

221
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,759
accurate but they can get you very long

222
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,440
reads

223
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,439
something we've never had before in the

224
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,110
sequencing space and to add to that just

225
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,030
this year we saw PacBio finally get the

226
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,649
single molecule sequencing to be more

227
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:57,269
accurate than Sanger data which has

228
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:59,069
really been the gold standard technique

229
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:01,139
that we use to initially sequence the

230
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,550
human genome you know plant genomes are

231
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,809
even harder than human genomes to

232
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:06,089
sequence they're more repetitive the

233
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:08,939
cannabis genome is upwards to 70% repeat

234
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,649
content that makes even these long read

235
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,390
tools trip up on them unless they have

236
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,980
the accuracy to separate all of the

237
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:15,750
repeats that are in the genome they're

238
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,580
closely related and similar sequences

239
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,679
and so you really need accuracy and long

240
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,300
reads to make that come together so

241
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,219
those came together those tools really

242
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,889
have only been available since this

243
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,300
December so we did present on Jamaican

244
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,259
line last year and those are done with

245
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,299
some of the more error-prone

246
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:33,809
tools that had very long reads and they

247
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,099
did they really push the genome forward

248
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:37,649
quite a bit in terms of its completeness

249
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,300
but some of the centromeres and the

250
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,259
telomeres and the repetitive regions

251
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:42,379
that have a lot of these cannabinoids

252
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:45,750
and face genes are still somewhat

253
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:47,759
Quagmire and these longer read more

254
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,980
accurate tools whatnot what they are

255
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,200
calling the hi-fi system at PacBio

256
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,970
has is begun to resolve those we're

257
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,190
starting to see full-length telomeres

258
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,870
and cannabinoid synthase gene clusters

259
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,180
all perfectly resolved with these newer

260
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,639
tools and that does change our

261
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:04,769
perspective on the genome and gives us a

262
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,419
better tool to compare it to all the

263
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:08,730
other cannabis genomes out there this

264
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,959
you know we all call it cannabis and

265
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,639
there's an active debate on how many

266
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,769
species there are but when you actually

267
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,740
start looking at the genomes across

268
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,539
multiple different varietals you realize

269
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,340
one genome project isn't gonna solve

270
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:21,929
this debate we're going to have be in a

271
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,420
world where we're looking at multiple

272
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:27,329
different references probably initially

273
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:28,979
a cannabinoid centric reference genome

274
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,290
set where we're going to have type 1

275
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,920
references type 2 references type 3

276
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:37,049
fours and fives so we understand the

277
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:39,209
genome from the perspective of the

278
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:41,159
various medical cannabinoids that

279
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,580
they're producing so you'll see so more

280
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:46,679
data on how we've used these long read

281
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,389
tools to really resolve and close the

282
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,579
chapter on genome completeness with

283
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:52,169
cannabis and you'll also see some tools

284
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,509
that are now being developed as a result

285
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:56,219
of that now that we have a confident

286
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:58,470
understanding of the order of all of

287
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,200
these chromosomes we've been building

288
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,930
chips with eurofins that can get us

289
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,180
90,000 sniffs out of the genome mostly

290
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,279
encoding regions that will be more

291
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:09,989
likely to be representative of

292
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,659
phenotypic changes or chemo typical

293
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,389
plant and these tools can now start to

294
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:17,459
get deployed at mass scale when you get

295
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:19,439
involved with DNA chips they're really

296
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,120
effective to run hundreds to thousands

297
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,300
some people run sixty thousand chip

298
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,179
studies and you can really begin to

299
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:29,609
tease apart the the markers that are

300
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:31,409
predictive of yield outcomes and I think

301
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:36,539
that's a really exciting change for the

302
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:39,240
cannabis field and so was it that there

303
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,889
was such advancement in sequencing

304
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,600
technology that you just really saw an

305
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:44,370
opportunity to improve upon the

306
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,399
references that were out there was that

307
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,840
really the well we the driver we

308
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,149
initially got involved in this because

309
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,460
there were only type one female

310
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:55,110
references being sequenced at the time

311
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,060
and we've realized we really need to

312
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,960
type two plants plants that made both

313
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:03,179
CBD and THC and and we want males

314
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,860
sequenced as well that y chromosome is

315
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,169
the largest chromosome and and it

316
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,840
probably has a lot of information in it

317
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:14,069
to understand hermaphroditism and other

318
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,980
types of characteristics of growing hemp

319
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,080
versus growing drug type cannabis plants

320
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,000
and so we wanted to get more

321
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,950
completeness there that the sequencing

322
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,720
benefits were kind of an accident and

323
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,940
and along the path of sequencing

324
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,590
Jamaican line the the companies that are

325
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,180
really heavily involved in this space

326
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,590
for doing too novo assembly began to

327
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,929
realize that cannabis is one of the

328
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,280
hardest genomes they've ever seen

329
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:36,659
you know they've recently announced

330
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,480
sequencing I think the redwood and

331
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:41,039
Sequoia and even those genomes are which

332
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,600
are bigger genomes in cannabis they're

333
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,339
not nearly as repetitive so they're

334
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,440
they're beginning to assemble into

335
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,970
better quality than the cannabis genome

336
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,620
so the cannabis genome has become a bit

337
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,899
of this trophy organism amongst the

338
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,759
people who make DNA assembly tools where

339
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,289
they all want to crack it because it

340
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,720
looks like it's one of the hardest ones

341
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:59,549
to manage so this is create a little bit

342
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,560
of an assemble thon this is where all

343
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:04,349
the people who build the DNA assembly

344
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,969
tools are now working on cannabis you

345
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,659
can see Sergey Koren has been playing

346
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,190
around with this with this new assembler

347
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:13,500
hang Lee at the brode who's another

348
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,459
famous person working in the DNA

349
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,259
algorithm spaces got his new assembler

350
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:21,599
that's been assembled with high ASM as a

351
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:23,909
name of his assembler Falcon has been

352
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,000
updated so all of the assemblers now

353
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:28,828
have refactored and retold and rewritten

354
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,600
themselves to manage this new data

355
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:32,758
content that's that's a testament in and

356
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,470
of itself and right now Jamaican lion is

357
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,019
the only cannabis plant that has these

358
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,209
HiFi reads run across it and put through

359
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,730
five different assemblers so it's um

360
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:43,169
it's a really exciting time to see some

361
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,170
of some of these changes because with

362
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:48,149
this accuracy means there are tools that

363
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:50,219
we can develop and are being developed

364
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,470
that can do DNA assembly faster than we

365
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,240
can map the Illumina reads and that is a

366
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,519
real change we've not had that in the

367
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,990
past so there's a so there's an

368
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,159
assembler called Peregrine we encourage

369
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,110
everyone to look at this is probably the

370
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,639
fastest thing we've seen yet we can

371
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,050
assemble genomes now like on home

372
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,759
computers which has never been the case

373
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:10,169
before so it's it's it's really we can't

374
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,399
take any credit for that in advance it

375
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:13,620
kind of happens there and impetus lis

376
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,179
but the timing is just perfect because

377
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,318
we can deploy these things on the

378
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,969
Cannabis genome and get the whole

379
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:21,539
community involved in trying to improve

380
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,730
the improve the reference so for people

381
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:25,740
who aren't maybe as familiar with the

382
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,079
intricacies of sequencing and assembling

383
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,539
what what does all this work really mean

384
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,938
for the industry and we're you know

385
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:36,149
cannabis breeding and cultivation can go

386
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:37,289
with this information well that and the

387
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:39,389
answer that will probably change over

388
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:41,490
time in somewhat regulatory driven and

389
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:43,560
the current regulations at the USDA have

390
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,299
placed a deep emphasis on washing for

391
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,549
residual THC content and there are

392
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:50,609
several sources theoretical sources of

393
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:53,458
residual THC content we can see genomes

394
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,879
now that have only CBD synthase genes in

395
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,500
them and they still make residual THC

396
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,759
and this is actually supported with a

397
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,698
lot of the cloning literature if you

398
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,419
clone CBD synthase into yeast and feed a

399
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:09,208
precursor you'll still get some some THC

400
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:13,979
made by that enzyme so there's a about a

401
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:16,049
23 to 25 to 1 ratio we tend to see of

402
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,579
CBD synthase leaking some THC synthase

403
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,109
now if your goal is to make CBD you

404
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:20,729
can't really get rid of that other than

405
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,558
to screen for plants that might have

406
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,629
variants and CBD synthase that alter

407
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:26,219
that ratio and there's some activity

408
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:27,629
with site-directed mutagenesis that

409
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,060
people are doing that may that may drive

410
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:32,159
that there's other cannabinoid synthase

411
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,469
genes in the genome that leaked THC as

412
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,990
well so none of these synthase genes are

413
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,149
really faithful they're promiscuous they

414
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,180
make a little bit of side product that

415
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:46,409
that is usually made by a specialized

416
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:48,539
enzyme so one thought is still a theory

417
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:51,029
but what what our data seems to be

418
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:53,370
pointing to is you know good number of

419
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,870
the plants out there have a deletion of

420
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,700
the cannabic Romijn synthase gene

421
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,080
cluster this is a cluster that can have

422
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,879
anywhere between three to eight

423
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,120
different cannabic roaming genes arrayed

424
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:06,090
in it and you can see this in some type

425
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,509
for plants type for plants have both THC

426
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:11,190
and CBD deleted I should say THC

427
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,830
synthase in the CBD synthase are both

428
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:16,320
deleted so they should have any capacity

429
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,470
to make THC a or CBD a but yet we still

430
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,379
see in these type four plants not just

431
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,570
CBG being made but also some residual

432
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,250
THC granted it's lower than what we see

433
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,990
in type three plants it's still making

434
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,820
some and we believe that's coming from

435
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,850
the residual can have a chromium genes

436
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,680
that may be present so understanding the

437
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,620
whole portfolio of cannabinoid synthase

438
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:40,199
genes is really the path to go if you

439
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,450
want to get breeding for seed lines that

440
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,780
can consistently make you lower amounts

441
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,910
of THC a it's almost it's very difficult

442
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:50,459
to do right now if you have a gene like

443
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:52,409
CBD sim face that is leaking if you grow

444
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,240
that above eight or nine percent CBD

445
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:56,969
synthase you'll start to see th see a

446
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,879
pop up in those in those plants at a

447
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:03,840
level that may make it insufficient for

448
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:05,400
USDA guidelines so the an average we're

449
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,318
seeing over forty different cannabinoids

450
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,240
and face genes to monitor so when we do

451
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,789
DNA sequencing or when we run these

452
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,459
chips that we've built we can begin to

453
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:16,109
profile these we alone have seen through

454
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,959
sequencing over two hundred and twenty

455
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:21,269
two variants inside CBD and THC

456
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,920
synthesis point mutations in the genes

457
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:24,959
that might be altering its function

458
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,150
those are all now embedded on the

459
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,519
urethane chips and we have tools coming

460
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:32,490
out shortly that will help breeders scan

461
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,769
for genetics that have the highest

462
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,839
likelihood of producing of the the best

463
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:38,490
ratios so I think that's what's going to

464
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,769
be helpful for guiding maybe the

465
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,210
the cannabinoids the major cannabinoids

466
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,680
then there's an interest in figuring out

467
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,259
what's making the minor cannabinoids

468
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:51,180
alright what might be making THC P or

469
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:52,799
CBD P these are the the the longer side

470
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,110
chain molecules that were discovered in

471
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,309
Italy that are 30 times more potent we

472
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,839
don't know what makes those we don't

473
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,190
think it's related to the synthase genes

474
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,049
we think it's related to the genes

475
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,960
upstream in the cannabinoid synthase

476
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:06,899
pathway and the genetics may help lead

477
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,410
the way in predicting that very recently

478
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,820
a Kanab of on was described discovering

479
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,009
heme 10 years ago but now they're

480
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:15,929
beginning to tease it apart and realize

481
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,879
that it is in fact plant derived and we

482
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,740
need to understand what are the other

483
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,050
synthase genes that might be responsible

484
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,779
there we're also getting some potential

485
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:26,339
now to predict terpene expression based

486
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,410
on the terpene synthase genes that we're

487
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:31,079
seeing and we're hopeful we'll be able

488
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,060
to get more focus on the can flavin gene

489
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,500
set as well by doing more sequencing the

490
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:37,139
canned Flavin's are showing a lot of

491
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,559
promise in I think I saw some work in

492
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:43,320
pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer so

493
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:45,599
these are flavonoids that are often not

494
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,939
tested for in the analytical chemistry

495
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,829
labs and can meds a great area to bring

496
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,240
some of those papers forward talk to the

497
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,439
analytical chemist to see if there are

498
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,870
standards and if there are ways to

499
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,309
detect them and get the extraction folks

500
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:58,199
involved to know what's the best way to

501
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:00,089
capture flavonoids they may not be

502
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,700
captured in oil extracts as efficiently

503
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:05,909
as other extracts and so that that type

504
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,710
of intersection with what the what the

505
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,180
medical field is seeing from a

506
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,490
cannabinoid standpoint so how to

507
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,430
analytically detect them properly in the

508
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,900
field and likewise how to potentially

509
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,390
grow for them and breathe for them or

510
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,000
all interdisciplinary tools that and

511
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,290
discussions we need to be having with

512
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,960
multiple different people and Ken meds

513
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,579
the right place for that so it really

514
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,860
seems like figuring out the the

515
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:31,409
cannabinoids the flavonoids and terpenes

516
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:33,569
is really the first step with with

517
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,130
genetics is that there's no I mean

518
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:36,899
that's one get that's one section of

519
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,480
yield I mean you're hinting at a really

520
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,480
important point here which is yield may

521
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:46,220
also be related to trichome genes or to

522
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,110
pathogen resistance for instance we

523
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:51,269
pathogens can severely limit a crop

524
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:52,799
upwards to 40 percent lower yield

525
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:54,869
if you have some of these pathogens and

526
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,399
understanding the pathogen resistance in

527
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:59,099
the plants is likely going to bring us

528
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,430
higher yield as well so the paper we

529
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:04,469
published back in January listed over 80

530
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,029
different pathogen resistance genes

531
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,519
these were mostly thamma team like

532
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:10,470
proteins and chitin aces and another low

533
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,960
sign known as mlo which has been studied

534
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,549
heavily in hops well if we can better

535
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,289
understand those genetics we can breed

536
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,319
for plants that are powdery mildew

537
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,519
resistance and and perhaps have less

538
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,429
Aspergillus that might be present in

539
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:27,299
them as well just by keeping an eye on

540
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:29,130
the portfolio of a pathogen resistance

541
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,769
genes they have some of the genes

542
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,660
involved in this pathogen response are

543
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:35,339
actually closely located next to the

544
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,680
cannabic roaming genes such that when

545
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:40,589
the plants are deleted in cannabic

546
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,630
Romijn they may pull out five other

547
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:44,279
genes for the ride in that deletion and

548
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,650
make those plants more susceptible to

549
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,690
pests that's a theory it's not been

550
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,130
proven yet we just happen to know those

551
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,509
genes are frequently deleted

552
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,420
concurrently which can have a CRO

553
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:56,700
meaning if people are selecting for

554
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:59,430
lines that don't have that to try and

555
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,319
meet the USDA we got to keep a close eye

556
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,420
on on the pathogen response to those

557
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:05,250
plans so they don't end up having hemp

558
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,250
plants that are compliant with the USDA

559
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,839
but are loaded with mold and mildew it's

560
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,640
important to know the hemp market is not

561
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,740
screening for mold and mildew the way

562
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,580
the medical market is and that's a bit

563
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:20,160
of an exposure point for us so whenever

564
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:22,409
you talk about genetics and kind of

565
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,190
genes and everything a lot of people

566
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:29,720
will start going to GMO or maybe even

567
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,980
CRISPR is there do you foresee a

568
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,500
potential that those types of

569
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,980
technologies will be used in cannabis

570
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,440
they already are

571
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,000
there's no stopping that I know a lot of

572
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,059
people find that to be controversial but

573
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,950
I think one thing you will learn from

574
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,019
looking at these cannabis genomes and

575
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,660
just comparing them is the plant is a

576
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:50,940
far better genomic engineer than we are

577
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,190
at the moment it is shuffling stuff

578
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,630
around at a really high rates I mean

579
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,100
we're seeing structural variations

580
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,990
between these genomes that may include

581
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,269
about 1/8 of the genetic content in the

582
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,220
plant that's a tremendous amount of

583
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:04,569
variation that can be occurring just

584
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,339
between any two given plants so

585
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:08,349
people are gonna make some modifications

586
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:09,490
some folks is gonna be very afraid of

587
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:11,619
that but they may not fully appreciate

588
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,750
the fact that this plan is doing that on

589
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:15,250
its own quite frequently and probably

590
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,679
more intelligently than we are at the

591
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,470
moment so I think there have been cases

592
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,139
of people like trying to delete tht sim

593
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,850
face with CRISPR and that's sure it's a

594
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:26,408
great plan but we already have naturally

595
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:28,148
deleted th decent faces in the

596
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:30,399
population and that doesn't give us zero

597
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:31,898
percent THC there may be some other

598
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:34,239
genes you need to delete as well maybe

599
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:37,268
another 39 can have nodes and face genes

600
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,500
that are leaking so you know the hemp

601
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,089
transformation protocols are really

602
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,730
early and I don't know that you can do

603
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:45,970
multiple site mutagenesis with CRISPR

604
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,470
and select forward and and it's early

605
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,778
for those types of studies I think what

606
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,788
you're more likely to see is rapid

607
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:54,429
breeding as finding the actual profiles

608
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,929
you want in the field and intelligently

609
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:58,330
breeding some of those characteristics

610
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:59,470
out of the plant and into the set of

611
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:01,359
cultivars you're working with and

612
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,308
getting you know CRISPR to transform

613
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,579
plants and get those to be stabili

614
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:08,678
represented and not to be mosaics

615
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:11,048
oftentimes when you do these genetic

616
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,820
modifications it's very difficult to get

617
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:14,589
them to transform every single cell in

618
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:16,269
the plant you have to start with a very

619
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:17,378
small amount of tissue and hope that you

620
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,149
get a hundred percent transaction

621
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:21,638
efficiency and then find a selectable

622
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:24,638
marker that brings that out to the rest

623
00:23:21,638 --> 00:23:28,269
of the tissue type that's not that's

624
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:29,740
uneasy and and so that limits what you

625
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:32,500
can do in many respects right now with

626
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,269
the current CRISPR technologies but I do

627
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,740
think they're coming and I do think

628
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:37,599
they're gonna play a valuable role I

629
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,298
think some of the most exciting genetic

630
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,329
engineering stuff that we're seeing is

631
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:45,668
the capacity to bring some of these

632
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:47,589
genes into other hosts like yeast so

633
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:49,240
that you can really torture test them as

634
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:50,949
an individual gene in the different

635
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,720
organism to understand what it does so

636
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,179
the work that we saw presented last year

637
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,788
with Dmytryk s-- interesting enough they

638
00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:00,038
were able to clone THC and CBD synthase

639
00:23:57,788 --> 00:24:02,528
into a yeast and by feeding it different

640
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,778
precursors from hexanoic acid to octa

641
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:07,480
nona they were able to get the yeast to

642
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:10,028
make th TP that taught us a lot about

643
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,308
THC P that taught us that THC synthase

644
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:13,778
can in fact make it and so that's

645
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:15,038
probably not where to genetically look

646
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:16,960
for any of the mutations in the plant

647
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,778
that are making it but it also gave us a

648
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,058
model to know

649
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:22,069
that when you isolate this single gene

650
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,868
and feed it particular precursors you

651
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:25,460
get a desired outcome and that teaches

652
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:29,598
us a lot about the biochemistry in the

653
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:31,729
plan itself so oftentimes these tools of

654
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:34,128
shuttling genes around teach us a lot

655
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:36,080
about the complexity of the plant so

656
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:37,398
that we don't have to we don't have to

657
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,028
get to as much guesswork in the

658
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:44,329
engineering you want to do in the plant

659
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:46,368
so do you foresee a future where folks

660
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:49,460
are creating cannabinoids with yeast

661
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:51,709
instead of the plan I see some of that

662
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,710
yeah I think the the benefits of the

663
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,450
yeast derives cannabinoids are that

664
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,759
they'll be highly pure you can you can

665
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,149
make them and make only preferably only

666
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,499
one or two of them depending on how much

667
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:05,148
side product you get the thing about

668
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:06,649
yeast is you can control the conditions

669
00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:08,538
you grow it in and perhaps coax those

670
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:09,768
enzymes to be less for me promiscuous in

671
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:11,658
that environment and then you can also

672
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:14,028
put different molecules on them if you

673
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:15,499
want to tag the cannabinoids so that you

674
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:17,749
can purify them that the casing paper

675
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:19,579
put a biotin on the tail and there are

676
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,348
ways to put biotin zhan molecules where

677
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:23,329
it's removable so they may be able to

678
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:25,878
they may be will you know edging into a

679
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:27,558
really highly purified form of one

680
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:29,269
particular cannabinoid which can be a

681
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:31,878
little bit difficult to iron out in the

682
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:33,469
plant that'll make for a great GMP grade

683
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:35,209
I don't yet know if it's gonna be

684
00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:36,830
competitive economically with the plant

685
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,269
when you start with when you start

686
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:39,710
getting more efficient breeding going on

687
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:41,749
the plant may in fact be a very

688
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,119
productive way of making this but those

689
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:46,429
economic things are you know best seen

690
00:25:44,118 --> 00:25:48,709
in the marketplace I think I don't think

691
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:49,879
it's gonna be necessarily an instant

692
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,399
replacement for all these other

693
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:54,259
compounds we want to make and part of

694
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:57,168
that is because you know you were

695
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:59,628
feeding yeast sugar in 99% of the sugar

696
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:02,809
the world's made by chloroplasts so it's

697
00:25:59,628 --> 00:26:04,579
it's likely that this is a great tool to

698
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:07,298
simplify what's going on but it may not

699
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:10,009
be the most carbon efficient way to grow

700
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:12,469
other cannabinoids but we'll see that's

701
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:14,808
that's kind of an open field certainly

702
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:17,210
if we could get THC P expressed in the

703
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:19,038
plan up to 20% that would that might

704
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,649
make it more productive to make in

705
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,329
cannabis however I don't know that THC

706
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:25,098
or THC P is ever going to be grown

707
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:27,199
outdoors meaning it may remain

708
00:26:25,098 --> 00:26:29,088
artificially elevated in price such that

709
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,259
yeast has an advantage I don't know if

710
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,859
people are doing this in yeast are going

711
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:33,690
to target CBD first CVD

712
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,939
something you can grow outdoors like why

713
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,230
is CBG and those economics are going to

714
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,490
probably plummet a lot faster than

715
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,950
indoor growing so I view the right now

716
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,480
the it has a very helpful tool for us

717
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:49,289
dissecting the biology and it may in

718
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,990
fact turn out to be a very productive a

719
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:54,480
very productive purification tool if you

720
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:57,150
will however we are consistently being

721
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,039
reminded by these whole plant extracts

722
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,509
being more productive than isolated

723
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,129
compounds that seems to be a theme

724
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:03,929
that's been in the cannabinoid space for

725
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,630
twenty or thirty years we don't always

726
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:09,120
know why we're doing the best we can to

727
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:13,860
profile those things but the complexity

728
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:18,899
of the expression of these of these

729
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:20,219
plant derived cocktails is it may just

730
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,490
be people need to get those plants

731
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:26,009
cloned and there's a great story of avid

732
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,660
echo which is an oral and that was

733
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:29,579
sequence and put on canopy D I think T

734
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,470
Kamala moans this this particular plant

735
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:33,298
but they went down the road of getting a

736
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,529
plant patent and in cloning that and

737
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:37,710
making sure that plant they could

738
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:39,690
stabili express the same extract from

739
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,509
and now they have that approved for

740
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,640
autism in in Israel and that's that's

741
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:46,710
that's a label that's really specific to

742
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,470
a plant that's dialed in and making a

743
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,450
particular whole plant extract and I so

744
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,190
I see that that model kind of emerging

745
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,870
is people find certain plants that work

746
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,610
for certain conditions it's going to be

747
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:59,459
faster to clone that and protect that

748
00:27:56,609 --> 00:28:01,558
plant and make the the the extract that

749
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,480
way then to figure out the complicated

750
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,569
networks inside of yeast and try to make

751
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,620
yeast mimic the exact you know recipe

752
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:09,928
that the plants making for that

753
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,339
particular condition so I kind of see a

754
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:12,720
couple different things emerging but I

755
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:14,899
don't really have a good crystal ball

756
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,950
and which one's gonna be most affordable

757
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,120
well and it's interesting you said that

758
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,819
that was gonna be my follow-up question

759
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,619
is you know if if we were to move

760
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:25,109
towards you know having yeast create

761
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:27,359
these single compounds what does that

762
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:29,269
mean for the whole extract community

763
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,979
because I know that there's there's a

764
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:34,200
healthy debate between between the two

765
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,539
of you know whether or not the future of

766
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,519
cannabis medicine is the single

767
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,819
compounds or whether it's a combination

768
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,558
and I imagine that'll be a source of

769
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:45,329
debate and conversation that will

770
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,420
certainly be taking place that can

771
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:50,460
this year yet no indeed I think it's um

772
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,140
maybe people are starting to see that's

773
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,700
it's a bit of a false dichotomy to think

774
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,170
it's gonna be either-or they're likely

775
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,960
answers it's gonna be both and it's

776
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,610
gonna depend on certain niche conditions

777
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,930
in each of those those marketplaces

778
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:06,599
certainly the FDA route is more tuned

779
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:09,269
for single compounds but we have seen

780
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,129
the story before in cannabis every time

781
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:12,960
we isolate a single compound the

782
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,220
efficacy seems to go down and we don't

783
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,370
know why

784
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,319
so the it makes for cleaner science it

785
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:22,500
makes for cleaner studies it makes for a

786
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:25,529
more comfortable FDA process but for

787
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,539
those who are looking at this as you

788
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:31,289
know a wellness product or something

789
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:32,629
that is OTC and less FDA involvement we

790
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:35,009
may have the freedom to actually

791
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,480
fine-tune these extracts but I think

792
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,980
these whole plant extracts really do

793
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,970
need a lot more in a little whoo

794
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,980
chemistry done than what we're currently

795
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,539
doing on them we are monitoring maybe a

796
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,370
dozen cannabinoids and it doesn't her

797
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:47,009
penis but we really are not paying any

798
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:48,869
attention to the flavonoids you know and

799
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:50,039
a lot of the other compounds that that

800
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:53,189
could be in this plant that are playing

801
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,720
a role that is something that I think we

802
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,640
definitely need to up our game on if

803
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,250
we're gonna continue to push for this

804
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:03,690
whole plant extract approach absolutely

805
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,000
and one of the things that you've said

806
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,640
so much during this conversation is it's

807
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,200
early and we don't know yet and I got to

808
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,750
imagine that's got to be one of the

809
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,910
reasons why you decide to put the

810
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,990
Jamaican lion information and so much of

811
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:18,180
the information that you've put together

812
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,460
public so that you know you can almost

813
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,259
crowdsource this information and kind of

814
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,620
accelerate our understanding of the

815
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:26,430
plant

816
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:28,799
yeah it's I've been through the story

817
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,000
before the you know when we sequence the

818
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,099
human genome it is one of these

819
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,650
scenarios where it unleashes so much

820
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:36,809
information into into the world that no

821
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:39,360
single company can possibly comprehend

822
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:42,750
at all and so you're actually held back

823
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:44,279
by trying to hoard the data the more

824
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,319
eyeballs that look at it the more other

825
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:47,879
things are discovered and advances we

826
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,559
all we all build upon each other's

827
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,650
knowledge base here knowledge is

828
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:54,720
cumulative right so getting data public

829
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,820
is has been extraordinary helpful we've

830
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,650
already seen multiple people publish off

831
00:30:56,819 --> 00:30:58,918
of the Jamaican lion reference before we

832
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,230
did

833
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,759
because they were at a stage in research

834
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,319
where we were the last piece of the

835
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,669
puzzle and their research had filled it

836
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,798
out and they're able to publish some

837
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:09,119
really meaningful results while we were

838
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:13,019
still trying to get the publications

839
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:15,358
ready for for peer review on entire

840
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:18,089
genome so it's really important the data

841
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:20,579
is out there public because this allows

842
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:21,868
it to float all boats and even if it's

843
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:24,298
your competitors boat it's going to help

844
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:27,388
you maybe hard to see at first but it

845
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:28,710
does happen so there's a few those

846
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,908
publications out there you can look at

847
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,429
there's a proteomic map I've been

848
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:33,690
wearing a lab that was that was

849
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:35,399
published there's some work from Keith

850
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,749
Allen on the terpene synthase genes and

851
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:38,278
Jamaican line that was published there

852
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:40,589
was a recent review article with Nolan

853
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,720
Cain's lab that was reviewing a lot of

854
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:44,970
the genomes that has looked at Jamaican

855
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,179
line I will caution folks so there are

856
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,769
three different main publications we

857
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,690
have done there's the earliest work we

858
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:53,759
put out instantly and October 1st and

859
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:57,058
2018 on this and that those are some of

860
00:31:53,759 --> 00:32:00,058
the more I'd say though the earlier

861
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:03,480
draft genomes that we have this recent

862
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:05,608
publication in January of 2020 has some

863
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,169
updated sequencing on it that has I

864
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:08,970
think it improved the contiguity to

865
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:10,710
assembly about fivefold and it's better

866
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,149
annotated now we have the annotations of

867
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,889
all the genes because we did RNA

868
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:15,388
sequencing on there and if you want any

869
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:17,398
of the bleeding edge stuff that's going

870
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:19,829
on the assemblée phone is all public

871
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,118
these are uh Nana tainted references but

872
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:23,460
they're the highest contiguity

873
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:25,230
references that I've ever been generated

874
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,730
you can see full-length telomeres on

875
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,079
these things which is really remarkable

876
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,829
we've never been able to see those

877
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,269
before and that's kind of where the

878
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:35,460
folks who want to play with the latest

879
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:38,970
and greatest are jumping on the the

880
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,619
assemblée thon data excellent and I know

881
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,419
that you've touched on it throughout the

882
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:44,939
conversation but I was wondering if you

883
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,559
might be able to kind of summarize what

884
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,389
does all this work really mean for

885
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:49,858
healthcare providers or cannabis

886
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:51,538
patients why should they be excited

887
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:54,239
about all this work being done in

888
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:55,739
genomics well I think we're gonna get

889
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,509
it's gonna solve some of the

890
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:59,069
nomenclature issues many patients will

891
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,929
know that this strain particularly you

892
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:02,788
know works for me I don't know why it

893
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:04,590
seems to have the same THC level is the

894
00:33:02,788 --> 00:33:06,778
next one but that one gives me a

895
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:08,668
headache or have some other adverse I

896
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:11,220
get sleepy some other adverse effect

897
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:12,330
happens so and then when they move state

898
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,009
to state they

899
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:16,199
necessarily rely on that same strain

900
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:18,028
name to get them the same response and

901
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,759
so once we start getting genetic

902
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:22,380
signatures across all of these things we

903
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:26,490
will begin to change the nomenclature

904
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,590
from being you know this is a sativa or

905
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,788
an indica and this one's going to give

906
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,259
you couch lock and this one's going to

907
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:34,048
be uplifting I mean that those those are

908
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:36,419
all associations on taxonomy that

909
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:38,609
doesn't exist and so we really need a

910
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:41,460
genetic taxonomy system so we know and

911
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:45,329
we can solve this sort of strain

912
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,460
specific whole extract market if you

913
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:49,288
will the other thing I think it's going

914
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,639
to do is it is going to enable people to

915
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:52,528
look at the genome and do different

916
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:55,168
things and think ok we have problems

917
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:56,849
with too many males and open fields and

918
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:58,200
the feminization process were afraid of

919
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:59,879
how do you solve that problem some

920
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,288
people might want to put markers in the

921
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,940
white chromosome so they can easily

922
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:06,058
detect males and remove them more easily

923
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,528
than doing perhaps genetic tests one

924
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:09,029
concept people have been throwing around

925
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:11,309
is putting a green fluorescent protein

926
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,200
on the Y so they can run drones over

927
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:14,878
fields and image them for the ones that

928
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,608
might be expressing in a certain

929
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,469
wavelength crazy idea but it would

930
00:34:17,608 --> 00:34:21,239
probably work don't know if it's

931
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:23,009
economical but there's ideas like that

932
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,809
that weren't generated in our hands

933
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,820
they're just ideas that have emerged in

934
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:28,108
the community ever since there's now we

935
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,970
have a white chromosome when we know

936
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,769
what to target I think we're going to

937
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:33,779
see the same thing and modulating some

938
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:35,159
of the cannabinoids and modulating some

939
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,450
of the other compounds in the plant that

940
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,039
are lowly expressed many of the

941
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:41,279
cannabinoids and face genes we believe

942
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:43,800
have been bred into near extinction

943
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,109
because we had one biomarker we could

944
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,820
test for and that was THC people could

945
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:49,889
smoke cannabis and know that we were

946
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,869
breeding in the right direction but we

947
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,878
now know that the biochemistry involved

948
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:55,579
in the plant means the expression of one

949
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,289
cannabinoid is a bit of a zero-sum game

950
00:34:55,579 --> 00:35:00,420
the precursors are all competitive and

951
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:01,619
so when you breed from one can have

952
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,108
annoyed you lose the other so

953
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,550
prohibition is probably bred many of

954
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:07,069
these rare cannabinoids into New York

955
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:10,170
station and we need to rescue them and

956
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:12,510
the genomics is going to lead to a map

957
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,889
on how to rescue those and I think

958
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,130
that's where I will see some of the most

959
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:18,358
exciting work that next year now that's

960
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,519
really interesting you touched on that

961
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:23,190
because I had kind of been wondering

962
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,630
that myself is that you know is there a

963
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,420
future where some of these minor

964
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,309
cannabinoid

965
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,358
to actually become major cannabinoids in

966
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:33,099
plants I think suck it up I think there

967
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:34,539
is and I think it's important while

968
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,730
we're doing that breeding we take a

969
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:38,440
holistic picture we look at all of these

970
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:41,469
other pathogen response genes to make

971
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,200
sure we're not sacrificing yield or

972
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:48,039
pathogen exposure to grab one of these

973
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:49,509
cannabinoids we're we're actively in the

974
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:51,099
space of monitoring the microbiome of

975
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,750
the plant we make a lot of the testing

976
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:55,390
kits out there that look for Aspergillus

977
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:58,568
a coli and Salmonella and powdery mildew

978
00:35:55,389 --> 00:36:00,848
and a variety of these of these common

979
00:35:58,568 --> 00:36:02,798
endophytes that are in the plant so we

980
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:04,450
think this is a really important space

981
00:36:02,798 --> 00:36:06,159
we really need to understand the

982
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:07,509
microbiome of the plants in order to

983
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,230
make sure we can produce the right

984
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:13,630
amount of compound with the least amount

985
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,338
of patient exposure and you can't really

986
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,440
grow these plants like a boy in a bubble

987
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:19,389
it's not how they operate they really do

988
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,130
need symbiotic rate relationships with

989
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:22,960
other microbes they just have to be

990
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,568
microbes that aren't pathogens to humans

991
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,150
and so that process I think is going to

992
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:29,980
be more than just genomic driven it's

993
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,318
gonna be microbiome and genomic driven

994
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:36,429
and you need both tools to really I

995
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:38,289
think skin that cat all right Kevin

996
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:41,048
we're coming up to the end here it's

997
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:43,539
always fascinating talking to you about

998
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:45,489
these things if people want to learn

999
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:46,989
more what are the best ways to learn

1000
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:48,399
more about what you've been talking

1001
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:51,519
about today well there's a lot of the

1002
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,139
Jamaican line data is an NCBI NCBI there

1003
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,539
is a high friction to get data in there

1004
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:56,949
so it's always probably three to six

1005
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:59,318
months behind what you can find on our

1006
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:00,818
website our website has the assemblée

1007
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:03,849
thought on it and a lot of the data

1008
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:05,409
links to a lot of the data there so if

1009
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,210
you can't find at NCBI make sure to

1010
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:09,789
contact us or comb through a website we

1011
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:12,699
can get you early access that data there

1012
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:14,318
I'd also keep an eye on the Koji genome

1013
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:16,779
browser that we have we have a couple

1014
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:18,789
tutorials online teaching people how to

1015
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,819
play around with that koji genome

1016
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:23,739
browser this has now it has 47 whole

1017
00:37:21,818 --> 00:37:27,130
genome shotgun samples that are in there

1018
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:28,989
so that's that's that's got hemp lines

1019
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,390
that's got typed for lines it has

1020
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:33,489
hermaphroditic wines it's got th cv

1021
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:35,230
lines in it it has just a wide array of

1022
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:37,058
different cannabis plants that are now

1023
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,539
whole genome sequence in public for

1024
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:41,180
everybody to use

1025
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:43,190
and it also has a trio of Jamaican lion

1026
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:45,019
samples it's got a male and a female and

1027
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,579
an offspring enough Albin de novo

1028
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:48,469
assembled so it's a really good resource

1029
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:50,329
to take your sequencing data

1030
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:52,849
made from any platform and spread it in

1031
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:55,340
there so if you've sequence somewhere

1032
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:57,889
else you can find ways to take that data

1033
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:00,200
and align it against the Jamaican Lyon

1034
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:01,909
references so that you can compare it to

1035
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:03,710
all this RNA data and whole genome

1036
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:05,659
shotgun data from other organisms so

1037
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:07,820
that's becoming a really nicely and

1038
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:11,690
heavily used tool so people can search

1039
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:13,039
this stuff and then likewise other we've

1040
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,840
got a lot of content on our on our

1041
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,429
facebook page and on our web site

1042
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,079
regarding one of the pathogen work that

1043
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:21,259
we're doing we are having some great

1044
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,509
success cloning enzymes out of the plant

1045
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,010
that are we believe are responsible for

1046
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,050
some of the resistance of these molds

1047
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,420
and expressing them in other organisms

1048
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:32,570
like e.coli so that we can make cannabis

1049
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,889
proteins that we know fight off fungi so

1050
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,350
we think that may turn into a really

1051
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:38,210
interesting direction they're kind of a

1052
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:39,559
green chemistry for pesticides that

1053
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,510
don't have to don't generate small

1054
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,659
molecules that are rich in extraction we

1055
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,910
want to go enzymatic here so we can make

1056
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:49,670
natural cannabis peptides that destroy

1057
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:52,190
or attack fungi and do not enrich or

1058
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:55,610
cause any risk in the extraction process

1059
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:57,050
and contaminating oils so that's a whole

1060
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:00,710
new kind of green chemistry field that

1061
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:03,950
we're looking at excellent a lot of

1062
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:05,780
things going on we love it any any

1063
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:08,149
closing remarks about km and

1064
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,769
specifically I think it's gonna be a

1065
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,599
banner year I know there's a lot of

1066
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:14,809
right now there's been a lot of

1067
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,659
nervousness over the koban crisis that's

1068
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:19,549
going on we are still planning can med

1069
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:22,579
are we've been playing close attention

1070
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,930
to that pandemic and in fact we've even

1071
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:26,569
built ourselves our own little Kovac

1072
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:28,159
test here for employees so we're not

1073
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,660
taking it lightly but we do sense

1074
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,549
there's optimism in the air and that

1075
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:33,289
this will pass and that some of the

1076
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,600
compounds that are coming to play here

1077
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:38,420
are showing some promise and that the

1078
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,009
the testing rates that we're seeing lead

1079
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,559
to a little bit of optimism there is a

1080
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:45,560
there's a high number of patients out

1081
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,909
there that don't have this or or the

1082
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:48,529
antibody tests are beginning to show I

1083
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:50,690
have some immunity so we do we don't

1084
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:52,940
think this is going to stall can med

1085
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,889
or delay it we actually think that we're

1086
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,170
gonna be around this corner by

1087
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:58,759
summertime and that the conferences will

1088
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,050
then cisu manned and we'll need them by

1089
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,050
then because so many have since been

1090
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,430
canceled so keep keep the data open for

1091
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,380
can med we think it's still gonna go

1092
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:09,109
live and we think it's gonna be a banner

1093
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,840
year great way to close it out

1094
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:14,590
thanks again Kevin all right yep take

1095
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,590
care of em thank you

board-certified neurologist specializing

1114
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:01,289
in child neurology his interest in

1115
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,240
medicinal plants led him to incorporate

1116
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:05,250
cannabis into his practice and his

1117
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:07,199
research since then he has authored

1118
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:09,539
several books and articles about the

1119
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,369
endocannabinoid system and we are so
