00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:16,320
[Music]

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,960
give us an overview of what they are and

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,600
what their role is in

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,599
cannabis yeah Ben absolutely so uh tpin

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,320
themselves are not unique to cannabis so

6
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,039
these are small molecules that are found

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,118
in essentially all plants at least all

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,118
plants that I know about what makes them

9
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,679
kind of unique for can is there's a lot

10
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,479
of them in cannabis more of them than

11
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,719
there are tend to be in other plants

12
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,439
like hops or or pine or whatever and so

13
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,160
what is a turpine a turpine is a small

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:46,799
simple uh molecule like it's small um

15
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:49,398
very aromatic very small very Hydro hydr

16
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,679
phobic SL lipophilic it's a small

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,239
molecule and it we've sort of known

18
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,519
about these molecules for many years

19
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:58,238
because as you just said they add to The

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
Taste and Aroma of the plant and so you

21
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,518
have something like you know even if you

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,399
don't know what tpin are you kind of

23
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,239
have still experienced them so you you

24
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,280
smell that fresh lemony smell from a

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,200
real lemon not the not the stuff that

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,320
comes in a can and you know that's

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
that's deliming right that's a that's a

28
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:15,478
turpine you smell that smell coming off

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,400
of hops that's Alpha huming uh you know

30
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,079
the pine tree smell that's beta pining

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,240
and so on so you've all experienced

32
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,560
tping even if you haven't run across

33
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,359
that term before and so in terms of what

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,879
they do in cannabis yes of course they

35
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,560
add to that unique Aroma and flavor

36
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,560
although um

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,799
parenthetically they actually are not

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,960
what give cannabis that real skunky

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,118
smell so we've actually isol or weed

40
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,879
were not the ones that isolated our

41
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:41,959
collaborators isolated that compound

42
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:43,280
called penal thol working with it

43
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,759
separately it actually has different

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,519
activity than either the Turpin or the

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,519
canono but just kind of a side note

46
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,798
there so it's not exactly that skunky

47
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,879
smell but some of the other taste and

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,000
Aroma elements of the plant are from

49
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,959
these tpin and so of course for many

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,560
years now people have been looking we

51
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,759
sort of knew that it did this taste and

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,079
Aroma but people suspected that these

53
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,879
have had therapeutic and pharmacological

54
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:06,239
effects going back some time and so

55
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,919
those have been under active

56
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,159
investigation in the literature and um

57
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,559
and then what as also as you suggested

58
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,199
that people have suggested that these

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,280
turpins contribute to the Entourage

60
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,280
effect the idea that the tpin might

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,000
somehow combine with the canabo to give

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,719
you an effect unique to the plant that

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,919
you wouldn't get from either one

64
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,598
purified alone and so there were sort of

65
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,238
all these ideas floating around there

66
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,679
had been some studies particularly in

67
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,560
pain suggesting that tpin could relieve

68
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,000
pain even clinical studies had shown

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,920
this uh but there were some real

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,199
limitations in the literature and the

71
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,079
there still is no solid evidence whether

72
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,199
or not the Entourage effect actually

73
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,760
occurs in like a a cannabis extract that

74
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,238
you yourself are taking or smoking or

75
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,039
whatever and so we kind of surveyed this

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,878
landscape and about 2020 is when we

77
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,158
started our work in this we said okay

78
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,598
you know there's a lot of suggestions

79
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:57,400
but not a lot of hard data so let's

80
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,119
drill down and figure out what these

81
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,800
molecules are actually doing rather than

82
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,879
just kind of throwing around ideas and

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,159
uh so we started by isolating the

84
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,199
turbines and studying each one

85
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:11,000
individually rather than as you say

86
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,199
combin into this kind of this mix of

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,680
this extract so that we could really

88
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,359
figure out which each one does alone

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,519
before we start you know at looking at

90
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,599
them in combination and so we published

91
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,519
that initial work in 2021 showing that

92
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:25,560
the turpins have what we call a canaba

93
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,480
mtic effect that they they behaviorally

94
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,280
they look like a canono although they

95
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,518
are not a canono and their ism is a

96
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,080
little bit different than a typical

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,400
canono but nonetheless It produced some

98
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,200
of these same effects in animals like uh

99
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,680
you know sedation the kind of the couch

100
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,280
lock or couch high that you get um

101
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,439
catalepsy decrease in body temperature

102
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,280
uh pain relief and so on so it had these

103
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:48,239
had these effects and interestingly in

104
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,039
terms of the Entourage effect when we

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,319
combined the turpine with a canono a

106
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,239
synthetic canono we got a higher impact

107
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:57,238
than either one alone and that's kind of

108
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,438
what got us the most attention in 2021

109
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,200
was this idea that that you could comb

110
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,479
that have that trines were having this

111
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,318
effect and that the effect could be

112
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,919
greater when you combine them with a

113
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,759
cannaboid and so that's what really got

114
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:13,199
our journey started in in this

115
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:15,199
area excellent um so how do turpins

116
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,279
interact with the human body um

117
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,959
particularly in relation to

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,399
pain yeah so that is still you know

119
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,000
really a big unknown question right not

120
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,519
completely unknown so there have been as

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,079
I mentioned clinical studies other

122
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,439
studies showing that the tpes relieve

123
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,240
pain so even like say a study where they

124
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,879
would give a Lin to um laboring women

125
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,879
like women in labor giving birth and it

126
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,399
show that they had this benefit and

127
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,639
there other studies looking at chronic

128
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,599
pain patients and so on give the turpine

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,038
you see this benefit but there's still

130
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,400
even when you know that there's still a

131
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,038
lot of unknown questions first of all

132
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,799
like we all know that turpins have a

133
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,519
strong smell and we also know that

134
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,840
humans have a strong placebo effect uh

135
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,918
when they're exposed to what they think

136
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,519
is a medication like I haven't seen any

137
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,279
well-controlled studies that suggest

138
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,279
that the turpine effect is separate from

139
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,679
the REO effect and mechanism is also

140
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,478
unknown right we don't know how this if

141
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,439
it is relieving pain how it's relieving

142
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,680
pain and that's something we try to

143
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,600
tackle in our own work by first of all

144
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,439
working with mice who do not kind of

145
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,639
have this this expectation that a human

146
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,839
being does they they don't know and

147
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,360
furthermore we were injecting the

148
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,799
turpine so they couldn't get like that

149
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,879
Aroma or that smell to sort of confound

150
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,879
the effect and then looking at the mice

151
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,600
and then also figuring out mechanism and

152
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,560
diving in and figuring out exactly what

153
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,960
these are interacting with and at least

154
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,000
in mice we now have data that suggests

155
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,318
that these tpin are stimulating The

156
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,120
cannaboid receptors in your brain so

157
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,199
sort of the the known cannabinoids that

158
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,199
are going to be or sorry known cannaboid

159
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,720
receptors that are going to be

160
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,478
stimulated by drugs like THC and also

161
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,840
your endogenous canabo that your own

162
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,879
body produces uh and we also know that

163
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,478
they can bind to and activate a receptor

164
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,879
called the adenosine a2a receptor and

165
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,478
again this is one of those targets all

166
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,399
of you know about even if you've never

00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,839
heard that word before because that's

168
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,638
the same dra or sorry the same receptor

169
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,038
that's targeted by caffeine so we've all

170
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,120
stimulated or inhibited our Denine a2a

171
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:10,079
receptors whether you know it or not

172
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,759
because we we do it through caffeine and

we found that the turpine stimulate at

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
least in the mice this receptor to

175
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,919
produce a strong pain relief in a

chronic and neuropathic pain interesting

177
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:22,079
all right
