2
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:20,039
so what are um some of the signs that um

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,518
Growers should be looking for to in

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,519
order to sort of identify a problem

5
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:27,159
before it you know snowballs out of

6
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,839
control you know um one thing that I

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,240
always try to have Growers do is Empower

8
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,878
their staff because a grower is only one

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,079
person and there in any given facility

10
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:37,320
there's thousands of plants possibly but

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,558
you have people that are looking at

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,640
those plants every single day Empower

13
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,119
your staff to come to you they don't

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,840
need to be an expert necessarily but

15
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:47,159
they know when something's not right if

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,960
that plant looks different than it did

17
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,479
yesterday have them come tell you and

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
then you can figure it out you know it's

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:56,038
it's one of those things that if you

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,399
don't allow your staff like I don't want

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,679
you to have your staff think that

22
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,439
they're making a mistake you know what

23
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,079
I'm saying like a lot of times people

24
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:03,198
will not go and tell the head grower

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,519
that something's a Miss because they

26
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,039
don't want it to come back on them like

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,799
oh well then you did this type of thing

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,960
Empower your people to say like if there

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,040
is anything that's off let's figure it

30
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,399
out you know if this plant looks

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,240
different than it did yesterday if it's

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,880
got purple stems if it's got stippling

33
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,079
on the leaves if the you know turgidity

34
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,078
is gone and the leaves are starting to

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,438
curl down if they're starting to curl up

36
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:27,039
like anything that just looks a Miss

37
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:29,478
allow your how do I put it like you

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,240
don't necessarily have to have a team of

39
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:33,519
Master Growers you just got to have a

40
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,359
team of diligent people and as long as

41
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,679
there's one person on staff that you

42
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,359
know can say like okay there's an issue

43
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,479
let me go see it like most facilities

44
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,599
have one maintenance guy that fixes AC's

45
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,319
it's not on everybody to do it so if you

46
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,919
have one guy that's responsible for

47
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,519
plant health and pathogen mitigation

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,359
when somebody finds something he can say

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,679
hey I got to go tell Ben what I just

50
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,159
found and you know it could be that they

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,799
topped it funny it could be that it's

52
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,880
hlv it could be that there's an actual

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
issue going on beyond that you know but

54
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,438
having the ability and that

55
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,519
communication between your team is

56
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,679
Paramount uh because those are the guys

57
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,039
that are in the trenches so to speak and

58
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,439
you know you got to empower your team to

59
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,640
let you know what's going on because

60
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,598
again the head grower is only in one

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,119
spot at one time and having the ability

62
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,318
to have a team that can relay real world

63
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,719
information to you uh you know very

64
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,199
quickly helps a lot that flag system

65
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,919
that I was mentioning a little bit that

66
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,039
really helps a lot because a head grower

67
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,719
can stick his head in a room and count

68
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,479
Flags in 30 seconds and that's a great

69
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,318
way to you know also track progress if

70
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,479
we had 10 red flags last week and this

71
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,799
week we're down to five then what we're

72
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,679
doing is working you know we need to

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,080
continue on that process that we have

74
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,560
implemented if we were at 15 red flags

75
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,760
this week and last week we only had 10

76
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,000
then we need to switch it up because

77
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,639
it's getting worse and so it's it you

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,158
know communication is I think the most

79
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,279
important part of integrated Pest

80
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:49,359
Management to

81
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,719
me yeah the communication definitely

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,120
seems important and like you said it's

83
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:56,000
it's a culture right and um so how

84
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,039
common is that the culture in in

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,360
cannabis cultivation like is it is it

86
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:02,759
becoming more of a thing

87
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,519
I see more and more operations becoming

88
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,560
more and more regimented in terms of how

89
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,120
they do things and whether it's state

90
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,878
regulations that have kind of

91
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,840
facilitated that change or people just

92
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,518
realizing that they have to run leaner

93
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,360
because the market isn't what it was um

94
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,920
having the ability to educate staff and

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,040
you know get them all on the same page

96
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,359
and Empower people I think is the way

97
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,840
that the successful grows are going if

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,840
you punish your employees for trying to

99
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,280
do their best they're not going to want

100
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
to work for you

101
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:45,359
