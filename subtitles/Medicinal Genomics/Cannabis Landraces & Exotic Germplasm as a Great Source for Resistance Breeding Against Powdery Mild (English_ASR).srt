1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,200
thanks again for the organizing

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:09,419
committee for inviting me to present our

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,280
research on Padre middle genetic

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,019
resistance in this conference it's a

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,739
pleasure for me

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,060
um

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,579
I'm a lead pathology scientist at Aurora

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:25,198
cannabis company located in in Canada

9
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:28,198
our facility is a dedicated reading and

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,199
genetics facility we were focused on

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,439
different breeding projects from oroma

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,840
it's one of the projects going on plant

13
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,299
architecture

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,219
potency and disease resistance this is

15
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,699
the project that my team and I are

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,700
focused on

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,399
um whenever I I mean I had this

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,219
experience that when I introduced myself

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,799
as a plant pathologist I particularly

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,780
with the people who do not have planned

21
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,439
Science Background I'm getting this

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,618
question that are really the plants have

23
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,658
immune system and so it doesn't look

24
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,700
like that they they have this complex

25
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,939
immune system so the answer is of course

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,159
uh plants have been around for uh at

27
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,739
least 500 million years that's evolution

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,960
of higher plants and they're still

29
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,399
around so they've been able to defend

30
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,140
themselves against all these

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,420
microorganisms fungal viral and

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,420
bacterial pathogens are trying to infect

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,040
these plants they do have a immune

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,618
system and they have an Adaptive and

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,540
inducible immune system as well it's

36
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,578
pretty sophisticated in its own kind

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,540
however it's not as complex as a

38
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:45,419
mammalian immune system

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:48,600
plants do have a multi-layered immune

40
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,340
system and I have a pointer so I'm the

41
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,919
first Speaker today that can use this

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,000
thanks Alex

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,219
so this this method metaphoric onion

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,540
showing the multi-layer nature of plant

45
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:05,879
immune system at the outer layer of of

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,179
plant immune system we have pre-formed

47
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:11,639
defenses defenses like cuticle or

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,979
trichomes

49
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,719
um secondary metabolites of pre-formed

50
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,878
antimicrobial compounds and we know that

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,300
like THC and CBD they have some

52
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:24,060
antimicrobial properties however

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,640
um in the heart of the plant immune

54
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,219
system we have an inducible defense

55
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,019
mechanism or immune response where the

56
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,560
plant

57
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,020
the plant host is able to

58
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,920
precisely perceive the presence of the

59
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,959
attacking pathogen and adapts and tailor

60
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,359
its its defense response according to

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,340
the nature of the

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,739
um

63
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,319
attacking pathogen or invading or

64
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,599
penetrating microorganism into its

65
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,419
tissue

66
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:59,699
plants do have certain receptors that

67
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:03,000
can sense the presence of a specific

68
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,919
pathogen and then after the perception

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,318
of the presence of the pathogen there

70
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,119
are Upstream signaling molecules nitric

71
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,179
oxide and hydrogen peroxide are

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,019
reminding them that start a signaling

73
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,060
Cascade and transduction pathway some

74
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,060
hormones play a role in this signal

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,098
transduction we had a speaker previously

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,840
that spoke about salicylic acid just

77
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,479
monic acid Ethylene

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,420
uh these are important defense related

79
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,759
hormones and plants to transfer the

80
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,699
danger signal

81
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,098
to the nucleus where defense genes are

82
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,859
located and these are the genes that can

83
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:44,339
based on the type and nature of of the

84
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,540
pathogenic attack can Define how the

85
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,158
plant is going to respond to that

86
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,378
pathogen there are several different

87
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:50,298
genes

88
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:53,039
genes that

89
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:55,680
produce a specific antimicrobial

90
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,719
compounds on proteins called

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,620
pathogenesis related proteins or PR

92
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:03,299
proteins and a program cell death

93
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,759
response which is specific to plant

94
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,500
plants Is called hypersensitive response

95
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,340
we'll be seeing the nature of that

96
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,598
response in next slides and this is a

97
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,418
type of response that plants can

98
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:20,579
fortify its cell walls

99
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:23,399
to prevent the attacking pathogen from

100
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,460
penetrating into its tissue accompanied

101
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,679
by the accumulation of several

102
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:31,079
antimicrobial compounds

103
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,699
so I just told you that plants are

104
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,279
pretty responsive to their environment

105
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,139
they can sense the presence of a

106
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,439
pathogenic attack but how responsive it

107
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,600
is there's a video here uh it's it's

108
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,899
fluorescence Imaging that's why you

109
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:50,040
don't see that much right now

110
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:52,500
it's top view of an arabidopsis plant

111
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,970
um it's a great work uh done by Dr

112
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,040
Toyota from saitam Nana

113
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,380
[Music]

114
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,100
um university in Japan

115
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:04,279
um what they did they added a molecule

116
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,240
here a compound here that can mimic

117
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,519
pathogenic attack particularly wound

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,819
response implant on this side of the

119
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:16,319
plant and they had this gfp green

120
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:19,560
fluorescence protein conjugated to a

121
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,339
signaling molecule it's called calma

122
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,660
Jolene which is treated by calcium ion

123
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:27,538
longest story short

124
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,360
uh when you see the fluorescence

125
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:33,000
illumination throughout this plant

126
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,538
that's actually an indication of the

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,079
um danger signal being spread through

128
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:43,038
the whole plant tissue so uh just

129
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,659
imagine that's the initiation of the

130
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,819
observation we have this danger signal

131
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,620
molecule put on the plant and then the

132
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,240
video starts I cannot click on that

133
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,220
place so Alex if you could please play

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,879
that video for me thank you

135
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,400
so you see molecule is here and bomb the

136
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,620
whole plant is right now alerted about

137
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:05,519
the presence of that pathogenic attack

138
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,639
here it's uh 298 seconds but if you stop

139
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,639
the video at around 80 Seconds that's

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,939
where this part of the plant is uh

141
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,620
showing response to the attack on the

142
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:19,139
other side of the plant so 80 Seconds

143
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,300
for the whole plant to get that danger

144
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,100
signal so there are plants are that

145
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,900
responsive to their environment

146
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,060
next time you're pruning your cannabis

147
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,418
plant just remember that it knows that

148
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,418
you're around

149
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,439
don't want to go into details here but

150
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:39,538
that's uh adaptive or inducible plant

151
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,519
immune system because uh

152
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:44,418
um if you probably know and you saw in

153
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,560
first slide we just

154
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:48,240
discovered and identified a new

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,978
resisting Gene in cannabis plant which

156
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,319
is effective against Pantry middle

157
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,180
disease

158
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:58,560
and the question here is that what is a

159
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:01,800
resistant Gene resisting genes are a

160
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,899
specific classification of of pro up

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,000
they they encode a specific

162
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,698
classification group of proteins and

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,579
these are the proteins that can perceive

164
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,960
the presence of pathogen so there's no

165
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:16,620
relation to the

166
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,659
final outcome or Downstream of plan

167
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,819
difference mechanism it's just the at

168
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,139
the upper stream where the plant is able

169
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,699
to perceive the pathogen there are

170
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,819
multiple defense responses that can be

171
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,860
activated that after that

172
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:31,379
interaction between plant receptors

173
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,020
which are our proteins or resistant

174
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,500
genes controlled by resisting genes and

175
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,779
a pathogen Drive

176
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,120
protein so pathogens when attacking a

177
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,059
plant this is pathogen triggered

178
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,759
immunity they they release some

179
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,899
molecules that are broken down molecules

180
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
coming from the cell wall of the

181
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,159
pathogen for example chiatine from

182
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,299
fungal pathogens they can be perceived

183
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,160
by broad spectrum

184
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,860
receptor like highnesses transmembrane

185
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,259
protein which initiate a broader

186
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,560
Spectrum defense response evolutionary

187
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:10,560
speaking in this armed race or ping-pong

188
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,120
like interaction Evolution your

189
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,939
co-evolutionary interaction between

190
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,120
plant and pathogens pathogens are abled

191
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:21,478
have been able to kind of suppress that

192
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,098
mechanism by injecting certain protein

193
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,378
molecules called effectors into the

194
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:28,918
cytoplasm of plant that these molecules

195
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:31,259
can suppress that broad spectrum

196
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,958
uh it's called Pam triggered immunity in

197
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:37,019
Plants resistant genes

198
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,019
encode proteins that can perceive this

199
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,958
specific proteins

200
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:45,059
injected by pathogen into the plant cell

201
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:47,759
so these are the proteins and genes that

202
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,399
we are after if we can find these genes

203
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,338
in in some genetic resources available

204
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,620
to us then we can use those genes to

205
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,200
make new cultivars or genotypes of

206
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,440
cannabis plant or any plant and make

207
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,399
them naturally resistant to that to that

208
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,399
pathogen and disease

209
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,459
I'm pretty sure that you have heard the

210
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,079
name palsy mildew some of you I know

211
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,719
that you're a specialist on the matter

212
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,600
as well Pantry mildew is a fungal

213
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,060
disease that is right now one of the

214
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,060
most economically important diseases of

215
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:26,159
of of cannabis which threatens cannabis

216
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:29,639
industry

217
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,100
um there is three important stages of of

218
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,220
these disease fungal disease first stage

219
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,980
we have the Spore of the pathogen and

220
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,100
this pathogen is mainly Airborne so

221
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,339
spores are in the air landing on the uh

222
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,860
a new leaf and then it's it's germinated

223
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,019
and they penetrate into the tissue of

224
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,300
the plant they use high level of

225
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:55,399
pressure in a organ it's called

226
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:58,319
aposorium to punch or

227
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,759
drill let's say the cuticle and cell

228
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,420
wall of the plant some of the pounding

229
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:08,220
mineral species have pressure twice the

230
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:11,219
pressure of your car a tire car about

231
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,160
eight pascals eight bars which is

232
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,139
amazing so it's highly melonized organ

233
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,379
that can produce that amount of pressure

234
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,639
it can easily punch an aluminum foil so

235
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,939
that's the amount of pressure sometimes

236
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,639
I get this comment that if we have some

237
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,019
new genotypes with thicker cuticle do

238
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,179
you think that that might be resistant

239
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:34,019
to Pal Jimmy do the answer is obviously

240
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:36,120
no after that penetration the pathogen

241
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,679
is able to make this organ is called

242
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,139
hostorium

243
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,239
uh and you should consider that powdery

244
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,958
mildew is a parasite it needs cannabis

245
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,360
plant or any other crop

246
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:50,458
to to be alive

247
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,039
it does not kill your plant it keep it

248
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,539
alive and it drive nutrients still the

249
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:59,360
host is alive

250
00:10:54,539 --> 00:11:02,639
and this organ does that job it makes an

251
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,860
cytoplasmic cytoplasmic interaction with

252
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,958
the with the plant cell and it drives

253
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,240
all nutrients from that plant cell and

254
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,518
it suppresses plant immune system the

255
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,799
plant cell at the same time it injects

256
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,399
several effector proteins that I just

257
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,620
used to do to do so the second stage is

258
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,419
that where the pathogen develops is my

259
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,940
serial Network on the surface of leaf

260
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:26,159
and then makes these vertical structures

261
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,800
for its reproduction this is called

262
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,100
conideophores and these are the actually

263
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,259
the last stage of the pathogen lifestyle

264
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,079
where it produces millions and millions

265
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:39,059
of of new spores and these spores are

266
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,819
ready to fly in the air and go to the

267
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:44,119
new a new plant and then just redo the

268
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,040
the life cycle of the plant

269
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,200
this is a very interesting image this is

270
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,759
not a photoshopped Halloween image

271
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,759
that's

272
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,700
um yeah Electro microscopy done by my

273
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,578
friend and colleague Marco Tedesco uh

274
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,379
it's on arabidopsis so you can see as I

275
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,359
told you the mycelium Network already

276
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,159
developed on the plant and then these

277
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,039
are the vertical structures coming up

278
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,019
making the newer Sports and that's

279
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,620
actually the completion of life cycle of

280
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,620
this pathogen

281
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,899
okay the

282
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:21,899
economic impact of

283
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,259
um planum disease as you know it's been

284
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:28,220
shown that even my level of

285
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:32,879
disease Occurrence at

286
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:36,360
LPS licensed producers it can cause

287
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:39,360
losses up to 30 percent of of the yield

288
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,399
and to control this disease although it

289
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,700
is it doesn't kill your your planet it's

290
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,339
a biotrophic pathogen as I told you you

291
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,139
need to apply several IPM products

292
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,360
integrated Pest Management products

293
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,360
which are expensive and it's labor

294
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,159
intensive you you need to have

295
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,959
staff to apply those products doing

296
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,319
regular

297
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:03,359
scouting to make to to monitor your

298
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,278
growth zones

299
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,560
um there are a lot of activities which

300
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,338
are again labeled intensive and

301
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:14,099
expensive for any cannabis producer so

302
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:17,660
um developing new genotypes of cannabis

303
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:21,500
which are resistant to padri disease

304
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,500
obviously makes a lot of sense

305
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,060
we collected A diversity panel A

306
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:29,458
diversity population of different

307
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:35,419
cannabis genotypes from different places

308
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:38,759
like about 550 genotypes and among them

309
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:41,159
108 genotypes were land races and exotic

310
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,838
genotypes these are genotypes that

311
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,259
coming from

312
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:49,399
mountains in Afghanistan from China we

313
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:52,559
had genotypes from Syria Middle East

314
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:55,019
Colombia I personally chose part of

315
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,000
those genotypes I I wanted to have

316
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,940
genotypes that are

317
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,679
um yeah evolutionary speaking they're

318
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,360
growing in the areas with high level of

319
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,458
humidity my understanding was that

320
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,899
probably these ones are a good source

321
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,719
for genetic resistance you know the

322
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:12,419
problem with available germplasm of

323
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,360
cannabis is that because of the years of

324
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:19,500
uh yeah cannabis production being

325
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,940
illegal the black market people who grew

326
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,159
grew cannabis they didn't care about

327
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,420
genetic resistance to diseases their

328
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:29,360
selection

329
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:32,578
uh was mainly based on potency or flower

330
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,379
formation all those economic traits and

331
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:37,259
they applied a lot of fungicides to

332
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:39,019
control diseases so the genetic pool

333
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,578
available genetic pool in the market

334
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:44,879
unfortunately lack

335
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,679
um yeah resistant genes or our genes

336
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,179
that are effective against against

337
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:54,319
important diseases that's why we have to

338
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:57,479
construct new populations comprising of

339
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,180
land rates and exotic races to be able

340
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,800
to detect if there is any origin to

341
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,019
detect those Origins and that's what

342
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,479
exactly we did and you can see this one

343
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:09,860
key plants growing in our facility are

344
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,860
mainly land races

345
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,639
this is a

346
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,559
statistical analysis of the population

347
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,159
that we were working on it's called

348
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:22,198
principal component analysis let's say

349
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,799
a way to

350
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:26,719
um

351
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:30,838
know the important factors on your

352
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,579
population and which data set and factor

353
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,820
that you're using actually forming the

354
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:38,179
structure of population and it's

355
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,339
actually dimensionality reduction method

356
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:42,778
in the statistics I don't want to go

357
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,820
into details here but something really

358
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,980
important and that's the first time that

359
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,899
we did anyone anyone that did this

360
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,620
analysis on cannabis plan as far as I

361
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:54,720
know the question was what if we find a

362
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,980
resistant Gene in a land race

363
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,079
we use that land race to breed new

364
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,300
genotypes of cannabis but that resistant

365
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,778
Gene comes with a lot of unfavorable

366
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:08,039
that might happen unfavorable in our

367
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:10,679
economic traits because these are land

368
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,319
races they're they're not good sources

369
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,259
or genotypes

370
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,560
economically for any Elite culture

371
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:22,620
so here you can see the we tested

372
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,838
several different traits here the length

373
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,519
of the plant length of branches Leaf

374
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,860
formation

375
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,659
um potency level because it's believed

376
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,240
that THC CBD have antimicrobial

377
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:34,439
compounds so some of this uh it's

378
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,000
another thing that I need to say here

379
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,699
that a lot of pseudoscience as you know

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,759
that are are available uh online and

381
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:45,240
about cannabis plant uh some people call

382
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,240
it bro science that believe that higher

383
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,680
potency means means better disease

384
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,600
resistance in cannabis at least for

385
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,578
pounds or men do that's not the case or

386
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,159
some believe that

387
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:58,919
uh cannabis indica and I know that this

388
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,539
this right now in the Costa Diva's story

389
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,698
is already resolved and it's not

390
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,918
supported by genetic studies but it's

391
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:06,659
believed that those Indica leaves are

392
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,620
more susceptible to palgmilion those

393
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:13,019
sativa leaves are are more resistant so

394
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,659
we wanted to know how is the situation

395
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,519
here and interestingly enough so we

396
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,740
tested our population of different

397
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,418
factors affecting of its structure of a

398
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,078
population and you can see that disease

399
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:26,459
index is not correlated with any of

400
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,779
these economic traits that I just

401
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,179
mentioned and that's the numbers

402
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:32,220
probably it's more readable that you can

403
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,140
see there are different correlation with

404
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,240
different economic traits but disease

405
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,799
index remain totally unrelated to any

406
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,099
agronomic trait this is good news

407
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:43,740
because that means that we can breed for

408
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:46,379
these Padre Miller resistance while

409
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,538
still having high level of potency while

410
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,900
they still have a in terms of plant

411
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:53,579
architecture favorable

412
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,360
architecture of the plant if

413
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:59,279
endorphiness is favorable we can do that

414
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:01,379
or flower formation or harvest index is

415
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,879
not going to be at least based on the

416
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,380
population that we test is not going to

417
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,120
be affected and that's the population

418
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,820
that we use for for our breeding purpose

419
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,579
this this kind of studies are called so

420
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:15,119
genome wide Association of studies uh

421
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:16,918
it's a known way of of detecting new

422
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,219
sources of disease resistant and other

423
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,840
economic traits in in breeding studies

424
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,000
so

425
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,220
um that's how our population responded

426
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,319
to Patrick Miller infection and you see

427
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,298
that this histogram showing a left

428
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,399
skewed distribution meaning that

429
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:34,798
majority of genotypes that we tested

430
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,400
were highly infected I mean susceptible

431
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:40,019
to cancer mildew and we had few

432
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,580
um genotypes that showed high level of

433
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,859
resistance and here it's the disease

434
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,798
index so zero means highly resistance

435
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:48,000
100 percent is highly susceptible with

436
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,038
no

437
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,798
um any defense response to the pathogen

438
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,980
and unfortunately or fortunately I don't

439
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,058
know I had to redacted this this

440
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:00,240
genotypes and names and because of the

441
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:03,178
IP concerns that our company has anyway

442
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,980
so there are few genotypes that we

443
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:08,360
detected that showed high level of

444
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,360
resistance so there is hope

445
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:14,038
um my presentation right now is more on

446
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,079
the pathology side of the story but for

447
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,819
the breeding purposes one method to

448
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,319
transfer these genes because this is

449
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:20,819
another question that I get that is it

450
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:22,980
GMO so how do you transfer just

451
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:26,279
resistant genes to Elite cultures no

452
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,099
this is being done through classical

453
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,319
breeding approaches one method is back

454
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:32,879
Crossing and I will be available after

455
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,759
my talk if you have questions about that

456
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,480
part but uh by by doing multiple

457
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,599
Crossing of our donor genotype with the

458
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,919
elite culture we are able to

459
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,500
transfer that piece of chromosome that

460
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,900
contains our resistant genes to to our

461
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,759
Elite cultivar and making the proportion

462
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,460
of elite cultivar Genome of elite

463
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,579
cultivar higher and higher until onto 99

464
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,600
of of the elite cultivar and the resist

465
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:59,599
engine in the final product

466
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,038
I want to share here a couple of uh

467
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:07,200
interesting defense mechanisms against

468
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,179
palsy mildew that we observed in RG

469
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,640
versus study this is the first one so

470
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,860
you see the plant on the left is totally

471
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,840
resistant to the pathogen it's a land

472
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:18,298
race here and that's a susceptibility

473
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,579
situation and this is hypersensitive

474
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:22,859
response that I just introduced to you

475
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:24,960
it's a type of program cell death that

476
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:26,418
the plant perceives the presence of the

477
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,720
pathogen

478
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:33,000
it kills its own cells in order to make

479
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,500
penetration impossible for the pathogen

480
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,079
and by doing that it is also fortifies

481
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,599
its cell walls so you see those patches

482
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,720
that are uh you see the chlorotic

483
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,459
patches here and there these are where

484
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,259
program cell death and hypersensitive

485
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,519
response is going on these are rare if

486
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:53,879
you put it on the microscope you will

487
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:56,519
see this all these purple dots it's a

488
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,340
specific stain that we use that can

489
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:02,460
detect uh I'm almost done it's just two

490
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:05,000
more slides sorry for that a specific

491
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,558
dye that can detect lignification and

492
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,500
salvophortification and you can see just

493
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,178
like an ancient Fortress where you need

494
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,900
to keep the walls and keep the enemy

495
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:17,759
outside of the gate this plant is able

496
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,840
to keep the pathogen outside of the gate

497
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,839
and castle

498
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,459
another interesting resistant response

499
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,839
it is not through hypersensitive

500
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,960
response totally different defense

501
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,579
mechanism it just destroys the mycelial

502
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,079
growth of the plant so apparently some

503
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:33,000
antimicrobial compounds in being

504
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,220
secreted and you can see there is no

505
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,019
mycilla growth on this plant very

506
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,779
interesting

507
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,220
and that's another that's the immune

508
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:42,960
system that we saw and by immune system

509
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,720
and Plant Pathology we mean that you

510
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,120
don't see any reaction in your plant

511
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,159
whatsoever as if there's no pathogens no

512
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,038
difference you cannot see anything and

513
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,140
under microscope you see this plant has

514
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,658
both hypersensitive response this these

515
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,038
are the Fortified cell walls these

516
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,539
specific cells that is where the

517
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,240
pathogen is trying to penetrate into the

518
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:04,980
tissue and then also we don't see any

519
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,620
kinetial Force pathogen is totally

520
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,079
unable to produce a new spores

521
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:12,959
and okay skip that

522
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,178
this is a final slide of the

523
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,419
presentation we finally found a very

524
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:20,340
good candidate for our breeding purposes

525
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:23,179
we just followed our patent two weeks

526
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:25,740
ago this is a gene single dominant

527
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:28,440
mendelian gene which means that by any

528
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,419
cross that we make the progenies will

529
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,580
have the resistance so that is highly

530
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:34,799
favorable for breeding purposes there's

531
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:36,480
a long list of of characteristics that

532
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,038
you need to have for these resistant

533
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,259
genes one of them is to be single

534
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:41,240
dominant and you can see that in the

535
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,500
susceptible

536
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,480
situation you have this spores being

537
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,700
generated Canadian Force but on the

538
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,019
resistant one pm2 gene because pm1 has

539
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,740
been published if you know if you follow

540
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:54,298
this story by Oregon CBD a year ago and

541
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,980
this is the second Gene that being

542
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:59,000
discovered here second Locus actually

543
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,519
that is called pm2 now

544
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,019
and you you see that the plant remains

545
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,058
totally free of the disease of the

546
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,980
pathogen and the pathogen is not able to

547
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:11,158
produce annual sport so the reproduction

548
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,919
phase of the pathogen is fully press but

549
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:17,299
this single Gene

550
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,299
thank you so much for your attention

551
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,719
uh there's time for one question great

552
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,839
talk by the way I love the topic

553
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,839
um is there uh have you tried looking at

554
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,599
this marker in other cultivars to see if

555
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,339
it still holds true in other lines yeah

556
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,019
we have we have made crosses with our

557
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,658
Elite cultivars it's back Crossing is

558
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,700
going on and yeah all of them show the

559
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:46,500
the high level of resistance thank you

560
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,120
so much oh yeah another question please

561
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,700
yeah sorry

562
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:53,639
um great work on the mildew by the way I

563
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,400
wanted to ask you if the the defense

564
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,320
response does it alter or modifies the

565
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,240
number of cannabinoids or did it do a

566
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,798
test no

567
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
we didn't find any correlation with the

568
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:04,319
level of cannabinoids and defense

569
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,500
response

570
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:10,740
thank you you're very welcome

571
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,619
please yeah last one easy mutation pm2

572
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,500
knockout or just a changing amino acid

573
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:20,158
do you know can you tell can you the pm2

574
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,259
yeah I I know that it's after

575
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,299
finalization of patenting this will be

576
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:25,798
used internally to develop new cultivars

577
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,139
I mean it will be added to the elite

578
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,058
cultivors because our facility has a

579
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:33,720
business side is Oco Innovation we want

580
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:36,720
to check it occo so that's that's the

581
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,339
plan for for this Jeep okay but e is a

582
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,500
mutation leading to a knockout of

583
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:42,658
Virginia or is it just a change in amino

584
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,259
acid changing the sequence or

585
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:49,320
the activity of pm2 yeah the mutation

586
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:51,720
the mutation so what kind of mutation

587
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:54,720
pm2 might have

588
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,319
I I can I'm available left right now

589
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,319
sorry
