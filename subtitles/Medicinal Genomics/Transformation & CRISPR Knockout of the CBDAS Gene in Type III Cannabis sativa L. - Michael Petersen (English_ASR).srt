1
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,278
thanks for inviting me to this

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,120
conference this was my first conference

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,199
so thanks you thanks to the organizers

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,320
for letting me present our research at

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,239
the University of Wisconsin Madison a

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,960
little bit about myself um I've only

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,320
been in the Cannabis space for maybe six

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,359
years um this conference has been great

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,599
yesterday yesterday I learned a lot of

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,519
stuff um I've been in the biotech space

11
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,719
uh for all my career so about 35 years

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,759
uh most of that in Private Industry uh

13
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,238
for 30 years and then I kind of came

14
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,039
back to University of Wisconsin where I

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,039
graduated from and uh directed a

16
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,759
facility that I'll I'll show in a few

17
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,759
slides that does um plant engineering

18
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,599
and editing of lots of different

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,320
species and today I'm going to talk

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,559
about the work we're doing in cannabis

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,359
and like Texas I'm from Wisconsin so

22
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,479
we're dealing with a Type 3 version so

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,640
I'll be interchangeably using hemp and

24
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:59,038
cannabis uh during the

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,920
talk okay so a little bit about um our

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,239
team at the Johnson crop Innovation

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,079
Center uh we're located off campus and

28
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:06,519
we're a facility that has about 50

29
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,920
people working at it we're kind of

30
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,840
almost like a small business um we have

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,560
our own production Discovery um plant

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,159
analysis teams Administration facilities

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,719
so it's almost a a unit uh outside

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,240
campus that that does this work um the

35
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,438
core hemp Team U myself Sean Kepler is

36
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,599
the faculty director of the site uh

37
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:28,438
Shelby Ellison is an assistant professor

38
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,559
working on campus and she does a lot of

39
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:35,239
the Cannabis breeding um and feral hemp

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,118
work uh on campus and then my team Cindy

41
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,759
Lucas and Jane they're all working on

42
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,599
the in the lab uh doing the

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,959
transformation and Gene

44
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,879
editing this is a a bird's eye view of

45
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,438
the center itself it used to be an old

46
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,798
Monsanto facility so Monsanto donated

47
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,359
this facility about 7 years ago um to

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,439
the university I directed the facility

49
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,519
for uh about 5 years and then I stepped

50
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:00,199
back and and came back to work on hemp

51
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,478
uh two days a week just because we had a

52
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,280
a grant for hemp um and I thought it was

53
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,560
just a fascinating plant it's really the

54
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,520
first time I was introduced to it um the

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,959
facility does transformation of many

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,640
different species um corn soybean uh

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,000
different different species for both

58
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,439
public and private uh Industries so they

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,239
can pay a fee for service we'll put your

60
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,280
favorite gene or knock out your favorite

61
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,319
Gene in any of these species and hand

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,479
you back to one seed and it's no no no

63
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,159
strings attached it's yours to do it

64
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,679
whatever you want to we also to do

65
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,840
collaborations uh and research

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,319
agreements as well if they're longer

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,039
term we were the first uh I think in the

68
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:42,799
world to staby engineer um heritable uh

69
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,000
cannabis and that was in 2018 we filed a

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
patent uh for our procedure um and it

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,878
was granted already and like I said we

72
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,679
have a dedicated team of of those folks

73
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:54,079
working on cannabis

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,959
research um y Hamp you've probably seen

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,480
this slide a million times but you know

76
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,878
some people call this a trillion dollar

77
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,798
plant um but not only for for uh medical

78
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,719
uses uh but Industrial Hemp uh there's

79
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,200
all kinds of uses uh for industrial hemp

80
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:11,280
as well uh Farm Bill legalized hempen 18

81
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,479
so that gave us freedom to really take a

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,120
look at it um because there's really

83
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,719
very little research done in the last 80

84
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,080
years on it um and then of course you

85
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,239
know the W the wreck use and the

86
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,879
medicinal uses uh even increase the

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,480
value of

88
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,878
that so I think really this is a a

89
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,318
disruptive time um for cannabis the

90
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,679
Cannabis industry uh I put this slide up

91
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,919
just to show that uh kind of the the

92
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,360
history of of putting genes into plants

93
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,958
you know first functional genes and

94
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,799
plants was back in the ' 84 um I was

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,319
working with a group on this as well as

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,640
uh some Monsanto employees and other

97
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:50,479
others in universities um that's just an

98
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,798
old southern blot showing T1 inheritance

99
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,679
um of a gene uh in a plant for the first

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,840
time then in in '96 that was kind of a

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
pivotal year as well where uh Roundup

102
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,158
Ready was kind of the first uh I'll call

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,239
it GMO plant that was widely

104
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,519
commercialized there was of course the

105
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,360
flavor saver tomato before that but it

106
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,519
kind of a failure uh but Roundup Ready

107
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,000
ushered in this commercialization of of

108
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:19,040
gml crops um brought in lots of noil

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,079
farming uh glyphosate resistant plants

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,280
um our group uh back in in before 96

111
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,439
worked on uh what you see up there is

112
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,519
that is the gene gun so we invented that

113
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,399
at a private company that I worked in um

114
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,839
and was electronic device that was used

115
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,638
actually to make that Roundup Ready

116
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:39,519
event before Monsanto uh purchased that

117
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,800
company and then in 2018 this is just a

118
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,680
a picture of uh our first transgenic

119
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,560
event um that's a T1 uh picture uh

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,079
showing red fluorescent protein this was

121
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,959
just a proof of concept to show that we

122
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:55,038
could do it uh progyny and the the red

123
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,159
plants in that picture um are expressing

124
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:01,120
a a red fluorescent protein whereas the

125
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,320
green ones uh don't have it

126
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,079
so a little bit about genetic

127
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,399
transformation in cannabis lots of labs

128
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:10,279
um have have published and and can do

129
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,879
transformation in in tissue culture they

130
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,319
can get actual transformation to happen

131
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,279
uh but the key the key thing is they're

132
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,959
they're most of them aren't able to make

133
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,000
it heritable or stable so they get it in

134
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,399
callous formation in Roots different

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,160
different parts of the plants but

136
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,839
they're not able to get a stable

137
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,400
transformed event um it's very

138
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,758
recalcitrant to uh tissue culture and

139
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,799
when I say tissue culture um I mean uh

140
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,199
embryogenic tissue culture so if you

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,840
have a callous uh form of the hemp plant

142
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,800
very hard to actually get a plant to

143
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,839
grow out of that callus to differentiate

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,079
into the

145
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,679
plant so one of the things we've done

146
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,719
since the 80s um at this facility is we

147
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,720
we focus on am meristem xplants so we

148
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,919
don't deal with callus or organogenic

149
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,360
organogenesis um we take a mature seed

150
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,439
we embibe that seed

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,919
overnight um and then we isolate the

152
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,879
Marist stems uh with the calans or with

153
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,799
the primary leaves on them so this is a

154
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,839
picture see the laser that's a picture

155
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,840
of what we're our starting material is

156
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,038
so that's your root radical um your

157
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,198
primary leaves there and then there's

158
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:20,159
the meristematic region there uh that's

159
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,160
that we're targeting for

160
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,000
transformation we've been able to use

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,839
both agrobacterium transformation and

162
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,560
the gun transformation for this we

163
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,159
choose agrobacterium just because it's

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,319
much more effici ient and

165
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,319
straightforward oops sorry um if you

166
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,560
don't know anything about uh Ager

167
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,319
bacterium transformation uh if you go

168
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,360
for a walk in the woods or in the town

169
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,800
you see plants with crown Galls so it's

170
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,000
these massive formations on these plants

171
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,360
that's basically a soil bacteria that's

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,759
infecting these plants naturally it

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,520
infects these plants and it has um some

174
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,038
anagenic genes that form this Crown Gall

175
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,198
so it's almost a cancerous growth on

176
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,000
these trees and scientists over the

177
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,360
years have hijacked this bacteria they

178
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,079
take out the genes that form that Crown

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,639
Gall the the cancerous genes and then

180
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,598
you can put in whatever Gene you want to

181
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,120
so whether it's a yield Gene an insect

182
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:14,000
resistant Gene hop latent uh mRNA

183
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,079
potentially um and that plant will

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,160
infect the cannabis plant and uh deliver

185
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,279
its genes to the plant and it'll Express

186
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,280
that

187
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,240
trait so we start out this is a an

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,759
agrobacterium plasmid we start out with

189
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,240
a plasmine that's located uh inside the

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,000
bacteria and this is what the bacteria

191
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,038
is going to deliver to the plants this

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,240
is where you put your whatever Gene you

193
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:40,399
want the plants to express and I'm just

194
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,160
showing you the the proof of concept uh

195
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,519
Vector that we used

196
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,560
whoops the proof of concept Vector we

197
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,680
used and I mentioned it had a a red

198
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,478
fluorescent protein in it um that would

199
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,879
be this uh TD tomato Gene it's called it

200
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,878
also has a gus Gene in it um which is a

201
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,720
gene that um if you give it a substrate

202
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,400
it'll uh it'll show a color of blue if

203
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,039
the gene is present in the plant so

204
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,038
these are just visual markers that allow

205
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:11,240
us to track you know did the plant get

206
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,240
transformed or or or uh

207
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,598
edited so those those embryos I showed

208
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,038
before uh those go through an antibiotic

209
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:22,759
selection uh we use spectamin as the

210
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,399
antibiotic and they get put on media

211
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,639
plates uh for about 3 or 4 weeks you can

212
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:31,198
see some bleaching here occurring so if

213
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,519
the plant is doesn't have the pomin Gene

214
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,200
that's spectinomycin will start to

215
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,599
bleach the plant and eventually kill the

216
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,560
plant anything that's Greening um shows

217
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,719
that that plant U may have the spec Gene

218
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,759
in it and it's probably transformed and

219
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:50,720
along with the spec Gene comes your Gene

220
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,720
of Interest T tomato Gus a yield gene or

221
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,439
whatever usually this this process takes

222
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,240
about 6 to 8 months going from uh

223
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,680
transformation or co- culture of the

224
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,879
agrobacterium to getting T1 seeds uh out

225
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,879
the

226
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:08,599
door this is our first t0 transgenic

227
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,879
event um I mentioned it had the blue

228
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,000
this blue gust Gene and we did some

229
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,838
staining and you can see this expression

230
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,360
of blue uh within the germline tissue of

231
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,000
this plant so we did we did this as a

232
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,839
preest to see um if it was transformed

233
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,720
and indeed it had blue in the germline

234
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,519
tissue so we were pretty positive that

235
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,519
it was a germine transformation

236
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,200
excuse me so a few statistics on our

237
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,719
transformation procedure um our

238
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
frequencies are in the single digits so

239
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,519
meaning if you take a hundred of those

240
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,320
uh embryo X plants we may see uh one to

241
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,679
five uh plants come out that are

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,879
transformed normally for soybean or corn

243
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,759
we see that in the 20 to 30% range so

244
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:55,278
we've got work to do to increase that

245
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:57,360
frequency but um it's very uh

246
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,000
repeatable um we've had success with

247
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
multiple cannabis genotypes and again

248
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,200
we're we're from Wisconsin so I'm using

249
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,399
CBD varieties I don't think this

250
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,320
particular procedure is going to be

251
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,639
genotype dependent I think we can do um

252
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,720
marijuana uh fiber hemp whatever it may

253
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,278
be uh We've made uh over 200 independent

254
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,240
events for private companies and

255
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:22,480
internally so it's again very repeatable

256
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,720
uh with whatever we're trying we've also

257
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,399
done Gene edits and that's what I'm

258
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,440
going to get to uh in the next few

259
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,480
slides and then since we're starting out

260
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,360
with a a uh embryo xplant we're not

261
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,920
starting out with a single cell we do

262
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,919
get chimeric events um anywhere between

263
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,120
10 and

264
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:42,719
20% and a chimeric event is just a event

265
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,959
that's not fully uh transformed in every

266
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,200
cell but it is a germine transformation

267
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,838
normally so if you take that that uh

268
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,759
plant out to T1 status it may not

269
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,399
segregate 3:1 but you'll be able to find

270
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:58,519
your true germ line transformation then

271
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,519
take it forward and it won't be chimeric

272
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:06,958
that's again I'll picture of our T1

273
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,838
progyny and some other examples of our

274
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,719
T1 so that was the T tomato we put a

275
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,519
gene called Ruby in uh Ruby is the it's

276
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,600
a a set of three genes that make beets

277
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,600
red so if you eat beets that's that's

278
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,720
the gene so we put that into hemp and we

279
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,278
get a plant that's totally red uh

280
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,519
compared to the null and this is an

281
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,240
overexpression um of that Gene then

282
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,919
we've made knock we made over

283
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,680
expressors and uh We've made uh some

284
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,439
other plants for private companies where

285
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,759
they're using evolved uh CBD synthes or

286
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,959
THC syntheses to see if they can change

287
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,958
ratios in in the in the cannabis

288
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,639
plant I probably didn't need this slide

289
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,600
but um normally we're dealing with a

290
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,159
variety we call Badger it's just it's

291
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,800
got um some some cherry wine in it it's

292
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,879
got some chardonay it's got some Electra

293
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,519
in it that's kind of the background

294
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,159
they are dious plants so we have to

295
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,360
feminize them or masculinize them to

296
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,600
make feminized seed in order to get uh

297
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,120
the gene to be homozygous uh in the in

298
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,120
the next uh Next

299
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,360
Generation so I mentioned our

300
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,958
frequencies are in the low signal digits

301
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,720
so we're doing a lot to try to increase

302
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,958
our our transformation frequencies at

303
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,320
the center we're trying uh different

304
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,119
selection agents so I mentioned we use

305
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,040
uh spectamin right now we're using

306
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,839
different agents we're using different

307
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:36,198
agrobacterium strains we're trying

308
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,959
liquid culture rather than a solid media

309
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:39,958
uh probably the biggest thing to try uh

310
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,958
for us right now as well as a lot of

311
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,239
other uh species that people are trying

312
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:47,599
are these morphogenic genes so these

313
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,399
genes elicit embryogenic responses in

314
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,159
plants that are recalcitrant to uh

315
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,600
transformation so things like Baby Boom

316
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,480
whel Leu these are all genes that a lot

317
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,959
of the uh big egg companies um have

318
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,440
looked at and are getting really good

319
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,278
results with especially with dicots or

320
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,160
especially with monocots and now

321
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,559
recently with dicots as well so we're

322
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:12,278
going to be looking at this as well um

323
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,958
yesterday they talked a lot about LED

324
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:17,838
lights uh in in culture I mean in uh

325
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,838
cultivation so we're looking at LED

326
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,440
lights also tissue culture so

327
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,839
pre-cultivation and whether we can

328
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,839
elicit uh better growth or different

329
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,079
responses directly in tissue

330
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,839
culture um media and hormone comp

331
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:34,439
components are always uh played with uh

332
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,880
for for probably the last 40 years so we

333
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,079
always look at those and then other

334
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,519
other Target tissues other than the the

335
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:41,519
immature

336
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:48,278
embryo so targeting um so after our you

337
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:49,958
know proof of concept was done we

338
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,759
thought about targeting different uh

339
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,879
enzymes or genes uh in the cannabis

340
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,199
plant and some of them some of the

341
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,720
obvious ones were you know the the

342
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,599
canabo pathway genes the turpine pathway

343
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,040
genes uh to look and see if we could

344
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,120
actually go and knock some of these out

345
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,958
to see if we knock these out in the

346
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,440
plant we got similar results that

347
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:11,879
they've done in yeer bacteria uh where

348
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,880
they've knocked these these genes

349
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:17,359
out um so one of the questions and and

350
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,040
it it was a controversial question for a

351
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,079
while but you know why do cbda type 3

352
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:26,319
plants make THC and medicinal genomics

353
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,559
did a lot of work on this uh and and uh

354
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,720
the the hemp plants that we use the type

355
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,638
three they don't have an active THC

356
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,560
synthes so the CBD

357
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:40,000
synthes um uh makes actually a little

358
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,599
bit of the THC so when you get your. 3

359
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,159
or point4 whatever percent THC you're

360
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,519
getting it's the CBD active CBD synthes

361
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,078
it's actually making that it's a

362
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,240
promiscuous enzyme it's very homologous

363
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:55,039
to THC synthes so that's what we

364
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,159
targeted uh in order to try to knock out

365
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,159
uh CBD

366
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,679
and this the reason we went after this

367
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,519
was back in 18 when the farmers uh or 17

368
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,758
when the farmers were growing their

369
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,720
first fields of of hemp and Wisconsin

370
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,120
about 25% of the fields uh went hot uh

371
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,399
they had to destroy their plants they

372
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,278
were saying you know we need a THC free

373
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:21,559
line um in the states that that get get

374
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:23,360
hit for that there are some CB GA lines

375
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,559
which is you know the mother of the

376
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,600
grandmother canabo of of that there are

377
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,518
a few lines out there in in 18 but not

378
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,278
too many

379
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,759
um the genetics of those lines are a

380
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,639
little bit questionable based on some uh

381
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,560
uh data that was done at the University

382
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,799
of Wisconsin there was also not in 18

383
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:46,599
but recently um GTR made a low THC line

384
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,599
uh that was high in in CBG as

385
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:52,799
well so we went after that cbda synthes

386
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,519
to knockout and we used this crisper

387
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,439
crisper cast system which they use uh

388
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,759
routinely in other

389
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,399
crops uh basic what you end up doing is

390
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,278
you design a guide RNA that targets

391
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,600
whatever sequence you want to knock out

392
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,120
that guide RNA sits down on the sequence

393
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,480
cast 9 comes in and and makes a cut at

394
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,959
that guide RNA um and then the plant

395
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,519
itself once it's cut it uh relates

396
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,758
itself just a non-homologous enjoining

397
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,318
religation uh event um and hopefully

398
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,519
when that religation happens you've

399
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,958
either dropped out a base or added a

400
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,240
base somehow you've disrupted that Gene

401
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:34,399
and that's that's how gen editing uh uh

402
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,159
works so we targeted that um the cbda

403
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,159
synthes in our Badger line um I'm just

404
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:42,039
showing a couple examples of what we got

405
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:44,719
out of that the first plant uh we we

406
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:46,399
sequenced um we had we had actually two

407
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,720
guide rnas that we sat down to try to

408
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,399
increase our chances of of it

409
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,319
working um the first guide RNA did cut

410
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,039
and we added a single uh nucleotide to

411
00:16:55,318 --> 00:17:00,159
this sequence which would knock it out

412
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,639
and and make a non-functional but we

413
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,720
also had an insertion also at the other

414
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,400
guide site of about 177 bases um and

415
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,480
this came from the plasma that was

416
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,839
introduced into the into the plant so

417
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,720
that was the first

418
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:16,240
event the second event um the two guide

419
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,199
rnas cut perfectly at where they were

420
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,959
supposed to cut and in between those two

421
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,519
guide rnas the whole sequence just

422
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,480
dropped out so we lost that whole

423
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,599
sequence the sequence came back together

424
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,599
and again we have a non-functional cbda

425
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,520
synthes and you know if if we're if

426
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,320
we're successful with this we shouldn't

427
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,200
make any cbda in the plant and since the

428
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:41,519
cbda is responsible for the thca we

429
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,480
should not have any THC in the plant as

430
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:47,599
well so then we looked uh at hplc

431
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,919
results um this was done on I think uh

432
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:54,119
yeah 5.5 5 and 1 half week

433
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,840
flower and you can take a look at um

434
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,359
whoopsie

435
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:01,119
sorry take a look at the wild type uh

436
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:04,558
plants here here you can see the the

437
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,959
cbda uh is is high in these plants and

438
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,079
then there's a little bit of THC as well

439
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,519
which you know that's that's what this

440
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,119
plant would normally make the

441
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,639
heterozygous edit and I failed to

442
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,038
mention but when you make an edit um

443
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,520
sometimes you'll only edit one Al in the

444
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,119
plant not both alals so you need to edit

445
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,839
both alals in order you know for that

446
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,959
Gene to be knocked out so we went

447
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:28,439
through a round of selfing of that plant

448
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,079
in order to get a homozygous uh lines

449
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,120
Lin for this plant so we had

450
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,439
heterozygous Lions which just had one Al

451
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,399
knocked out homozygous Lions which had

452
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,240
both alals knocked out you can see the

453
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
heterozygous look very similar to Wild

454
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,558
type results and the homozygous edit

455
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,000
completely drops out the CBD um and the

456
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,678
THC and then the precursor which is CBG

457
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,480
elevates levels because there's nothing

458
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,798
pulling on it anymore so we have a high

459
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,759
CBG line um again these were only at 5.5

460
00:18:53,798 --> 00:19:00,000
weeks uh taken normally this Badger line

461
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:02,279
is somewhere in the teens uh for for CBD

462
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,798
so we expect when we test this you know

463
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,558
at later stages we should be in the

464
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:10,960
teens for for

465
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:14,399
CBG um this line uh also we we applied

466
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,480
to USDA for non-regulated status um and

467
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,519
got that approved a couple months ago so

468
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
you can freely this is an edited plant

469
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,200
you can freely plant it uh out in the

470
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,839
fields without

471
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,798
regulation and we call it Badger G just

472
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:30,359
for where the badger

473
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:32,720
state um so next step for this Badger G

474
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:34,639
line we want to fully genome sequence it

475
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,919
uh we're bulking up feminized seed right

476
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,120
now so that we can get larger quantities

477
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,799
for people that are that may be

478
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:41,918
interested in it and again this is just

479
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:44,558
a high CBG line so there are other CBG

480
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,960
lines out there we realize um but back

481
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:50,960
in 18 this is this is what we were

482
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,319
after um there's companies uh hypercan

483
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,480
is a company that's interested in this

484
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,200
line uh they want to have a blank slate

485
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,200
to start with so a high CBG line would

486
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,080
be optimal for them to put in their

487
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,798
engineered cbda synthes genes so they

488
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:08,839
can play around with ratios of THC to

489
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:10,798
CBD um Penn State's interested in this

490
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,678
for animal feed so since it doesn't have

491
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,200
any THC whatsoever uh this it gets past

492
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,679
some of the regulation uh that some

493
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,558
states have for animal feed and then

494
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,400
we're crossing this line since since our

495
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:24,599
line is kind of an unknown this Badger

496
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,720
Line's unknown it's it's uh it's it's a

497
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,678
cherry wine based uh background we're

498
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,519
crossing this line with better known CBD

499
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,038
varieties like uh ACDC and some others

500
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:38,119
uh to get into a hopefully a a a well

501
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:40,319
more well-known Cult of our2

502
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,599
people and then um the other thing we're

503
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,720
going to do with this line is take a

504
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:48,558
look since we we have a lot of CBG

505
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,798
available um CBC is another minor canabo

506
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,119
that we've heard a lot of people are

507
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:54,319
interested in having a very high CBC

508
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:57,279
line so we think by using this line and

509
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:00,079
introducing either mutations to the CBC

510
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,319
or overexpressing the CBC C synthes in

511
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:06,720
this in this line we should be able to

512
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,720
make uh a 10% plus CBC

513
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:14,558
line so other ongoing research

514
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,678
um is uh that we're doing besides

515
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,960
cannaboids increasing flour and tri

516
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,480
Chrome production to try to just

517
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,679
increase overall

518
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:26,960
canabo levels uh biomass and yield which

519
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,320
is is with any crop uh

520
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,960
valuable uh flavor oids we're looking at

521
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,480
the flavonoid pathway to see if we can

522
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,798
increase maybe can flaven a can flaven B

523
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,440
that can be used in medicinal uh studies

524
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,879
fiber properties so Industrial Hemp uh

525
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,400
is up and coming uh so a lot of people

526
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,840
are asking you know what can we do for

527
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,000
for fiber um in hemp can we make more

528
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,720
uniform fibers longer fibers uh reduce

529
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,839
certain lignin in hemp things like that

530
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,919
so we'll look at fibers and then seed

531
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:59,278
and nutrition can we do anything with

532
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,360
seed so again you know I I I I find is

533
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,839
very uh similar to what they were

534
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,519
looking at in the 80s back for R crops

535
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,599
you know think about any trait you want

536
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,158
to put into hemp if it's if if you don't

537
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,759
think you can do it by breeding or

538
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,200
molecular breeding or it's going to take

539
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,200
too long um but this is a has

540
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,960
potential uh disease so I got sandwich

541
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,919
in between two hop Lon talks um and I

542
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,720
that's all I hear I hear a lot at this

543
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,400
conference um so hop lant is another

544
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,000
Target uh that we're doing uh it's been

545
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,159
shown to you know the RNA technology has

546
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,960
been shown in other species to work for

547
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,760
other viruses and viroids so we're going

548
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,240
to try to um attack that as well as

549
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:43,359
powdery mildew um so there are again

550
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,960
other species like wheat and and others

551
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,240
that people have been successful at

552
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,360
getting powdery milder resistance in so

553
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,720
we're going to try to do that in help as

554
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,959
well tpine profiles are another uh area

555
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,679
that people are interested in so

556
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,440
increasing levels of various Tarpin that

557
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,919
are desirable increasing Tricom

558
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,440
density um and maybe knocking out

559
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,000
certain turpins that people don't want

560
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,640
to have so you can customize your uh

561
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,759
smells or flavors or whatnot uh with

562
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,559
different

563
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:17,879
turbines herbicide resistance it's

564
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:19,759
always out there um I have larger

565
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,480
companies asking um that that are

566
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,359
looking at at hemp for paper um they

567
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:29,120
claim weed is a is a problem in their

568
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:31,639
large Fields so they ask about that

569
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,038
and then just a just a few uh slides on

570
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,559
collaborations that we have and these

571
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,960
were just press releases so that's why I

572
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,038
put them up um zal was a customer that

573
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,640
came out and put their uh photo seed

574
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,480
trait in hemp and they got an increase

575
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,000
in in biomass uh oil and then hyper can

576
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,319
this should say actually 2023 but hyper

577
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,359
can uh put their uh evolved CBD synthes

578
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,798
syntheses which are supposedly very

579
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:57,759
active and and produce more CBD uh in

580
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:00,798
the plant uh into hemp as well and they

581
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:04,200
saw an increase and kinoid

582
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:07,278
content um again hyper can uses a lot of

583
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,159
um uh x-ray crystallography they know

584
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,679
this enzyme inside and out they know

585
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,559
what mutations uh can make can can

586
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,919
change the cbda synthes to make

587
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:19,000
different ratios of CBD to THC so they

588
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,120
can customize that and I think the last

589
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,480
one on hyper cannons this was just their

590
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:27,759
data from their press release so showing

591
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:30,919
an increase in um uh leaves and immature

592
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:33,879
flowers in different uh cannabinoids

593
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:36,000
mainly the CBD and the

594
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,960
THC and I'm going through these pretty

595
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,919
fast because I'm running out of time uh

596
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,360
and then we're also looking again at the

597
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,559
CBC because there seems to be a lot of

598
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:47,398
interest in CBC so can we make a CBC

599
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:49,519
line that is 10% plus 15% plus uh for

600
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:49,519
the

601
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,200
community and this was this was kind of

602
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,599
hot off the presses I thought I'd throw

603
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,679
in there um we got this this result last

604
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,079
week it's very early it's just on uh

605
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,159
young leaves

606
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:05,480
but we targeted uh also an the OAC

607
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:08,440
enzyme which is olivetolic acid cyclas

608
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,278
um that's olic acid and gpp are the two

609
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,278
precursors uh to CVG so if you knock out

610
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:16,038
one of them the plant ideally shouldn't

611
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,919
make any any cannabinoids at all uh and

612
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:20,440
that's what we're seeing in this early

613
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:25,278
data for leaf data so our control line

614
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:28,080
makes um some um CV CBG cbga um and our

615
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,960
OAC knockout basically doesn't make uh

616
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,480
we're still looking at at these bars

617
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,200
here they're kind of right at the limit

618
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,000
of detection for our hplc so we don't

619
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,919
know if they're real or not but um it's

620
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,038
it's basically dropped out uh the CBG

621
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,559
out of this

622
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,158
plant so I I came to this conference you

623
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:46,759
know looking trying to trying to open

624
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,880
minds and trying to think about you know

625
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,640
what what traits are are out there that

626
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,640
people are very interested in looking

627
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,278
for collaborations uh Partners uh

628
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,679
anybody interested in you know uh

629
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,679
putting their favorite trade or knocking

630
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,679
out their trade in hemp can come talk to

631
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,399
me after the after the

632
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,399
talk and that's my last

633
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,720
[Applause]

634
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,720
slide

635
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:22,640
questions do you happen to have any

636
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,759
pictures with you of the early transfer

637
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,038
early

638
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,079
regeneration uh process you know once

639
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:29,919
you once you transformed these Mir

640
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,398
things

641
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:36,080
maybe you have some more other than the

642
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:37,879
ones I've shown yeah um just how it

643
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,000
looks like when it when they come back

644
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,679
from you know regenerate from that

645
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,200
little yeah I'm sure I could dig up some

646
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,200
for you we can yep

647
00:26:51,919 --> 00:27:00,240
yeah hear

648
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,240
me screen great talk excellent work

649
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,000
yeah yeah so there a couple different

650
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,918
answers I guess um if you you know want

651
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,278
to knock out multiple multiple genes you

652
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,799
know just design your guide Ras to knock

653
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,240
out you know whatever Gene you want um

654
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,839
normally binary plasmas in aggro

655
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,759
normally you can make uh you know

656
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,798
probably up to a 30 KB uh vector and

657
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:38,720
have it stable um we've been playing

658
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:40,440
around and have had success with um a

659
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,200
new I I showed it up there on one of the

660
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,440
slides called it's a vector called

661
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,919
Gantry so it's it doesn't use a binary

662
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,798
Vector we uh we put the uh the genes

663
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,038
right in the backbone of the Agro and

664
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,558
deliver it through the backbone of the

665
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:59,200
Agro and we're able to make uh easily

666
00:27:54,558 --> 00:28:02,359
over 40 KB uh in uh size plasmas to put

667
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,840
in so if we wanted to do overexpress say

668
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:07,359
a a multi-cistronic uh you know pathway

669
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,759
or whatever you could do it using that

670
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,759
Gantry Vector

671
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:19,319
y can you get yeah efficiency normally I

672
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,000
would say goes down just in general in

673
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:25,678
all species once you hit uh say 15 or 20

674
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,119
KB delivering that tdna size that's

675
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,440
where it just starts dropping off you

676
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,000
can still deliver over a 30 KB thing but

677
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,759
your efficiency of delivering that whole

678
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,798
thing is is going to go down the nice

679
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,200
part of the system is you know you put

680
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:40,798
your selectable marker on the left

681
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,080
border right so you you're you're sure

682
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,599
that the whole thing is going to go in

683
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,798
and read through the whole thing

684
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:48,918
yep and you mentioned that you're

685
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,918
working with different oxitop strains of

686
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,880
agrobacterium have you seen any

687
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,000
significant

688
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,720
differences yeah it's kind of early work

689
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,919
we're doing some lba4404 thigh minus

690
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,519
string or thyine minus strains the main

691
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,440
re the reason we're doing that is just

692
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,919
aggro overgrowth you know we're trying

693
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,600
to uh control the overgrowth in the in

694
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,640
the augur we use tattin we use carb we

695
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:12,639
use sep but every once in a while we'll

696
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,600
have we'll get this cropping of Agro

697
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,278
overgrowth that tends to lower

698
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:20,079
efficiencies um the thyine

699
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,798
minus I I think it's still out whether

700
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,199
they're uh as as efficient as other

701
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,038
vectors um I've I've seen certain cases

702
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,640
where certain um oxit Tropic vectors

703
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,398
don't perform as well

704
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,480
uh as in delivering TD n so you work

705
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:36,959
with LBA as opposed to like GB 3101 or

706
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,159
so the work we're doing here and I

707
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,120
mentioned LBA because that's kind of the

708
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:43,840
that's the oxit trro we have right now

709
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:48,278
okay um the work we're doing in cannabis

710
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:50,240
right now we've done uh gv3101 is is the

711
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:55,440
the one vector we've done but we mainly

712
00:29:50,240 --> 00:30:01,480
use a a strain called 18r 12v so it's a

713
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:04,720
it's a uh it's a a k599 based or RI type

714
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,120
Vector um that was

715
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,679
disarmed so and we use that mainly

716
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,879
because it it gives us a little bit

717
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:14,320
better quality of an insert so we get

718
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,799
fewer potentially fewer copies going in

719
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,918
uh with with that particular thing

720
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:19,918
because it uses An rri

721
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:28,449
Origin okay thanks

722
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:28,450
[Applause]
