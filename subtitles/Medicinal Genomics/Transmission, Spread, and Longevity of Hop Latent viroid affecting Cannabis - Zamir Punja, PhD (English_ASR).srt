1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,638
so good morning everyone um thanks for

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:13,518
the opportunity to talk about hot PL and

3
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:14,718
vroid my name is zamir punja and I'd

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,439
like to start with just an

5
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:22,239
acknowledgement of our collaborators and

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,240
uh co-authors on this particular um

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,079
presentation so this is uh greenhous

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,960
grown cannabis and um this is the the um

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,759
production system that I'll be talking

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,558
about with regard to spread of hot plate

11
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:39,718
and viroid it's basically a greenhous

12
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,640
grown cannabis and hotl and vroid is a

13
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,920
major problem not just in Canada but as

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,558
many of you know also in uh in the

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,160
US so I'm going to start out with some

16
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,799
uh symptomology um pictures just to

17
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:56,119
indicate what this vroid actually does

18
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,839
to um cannabis plants so these are

19
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:01,599
obviously high THC lines and what you

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,239
see here on the left is the the first

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,920
symptomology that you would encounter in

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,560
a vegetative plant that is affected by

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,519
hopl

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,200
vroid and as you can see the stunting uh

25
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,000
the shorter internodes and in some cases

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,478
um the leaves are slightly darker green

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,438
than the uh healthy plant that's over on

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,159
the right so this would be in highly

29
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:24,959
susceptible genotypes you don't

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,320
necessarily see those symptoms in every

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:31,000
um cannabis um variety or strain that's

32
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,118
grown here it is a little bit later on

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,799
when the plants are starting to go into

34
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:39,200
flour so this would be uh 2 weeks into

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,320
flower and again you can see the the

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,439
plants are much smaller the leaves are

37
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:47,039
um dark green and as you'll see in a few

38
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:50,000
minutes the the floral development is

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,040
significantly reduced and so Growers do

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,640
recognize symptomology of hop latent

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,118
early on particularly in in highly

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,599
susceptible um

43
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,519
varieties so this is what obviously is

44
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,640
the major economic impact is when HBL

45
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,000
and vroid infected plants going into

46
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,479
flower have much shorter inflorescences

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,360
uh poorly developed as you see here and

48
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,878
um as you'll see later on the yield goes

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,200
down and so does the levels of

50
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,878
cannabinoids in particular uh THC and

51
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,878
CBD so this is again a very obvious

52
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,039
symptom on highly susceptible genotypes

53
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,719
when the Growers walk through they'll

54
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,919
see the the stunting and obviously the

55
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,479
term dutting has been used to to

56
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,000
describe this this poor um development

57
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,919
of the

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,120
inflorescence now we also looked at um

59
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,119
tricomes and as all of you know tricomes

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,400
are obviously the most important feature

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,239
in cannabis plants that allow the

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,840
production and accumulation of uh

63
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,200
cannabinoids including THC and here you

64
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,800
see a very nice comparison um between uh

65
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,679
a healthy extract of Tricom so these

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,519
were tricomes that were collected from

67
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,319
dried flowers um right before for sale

68
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,319
and you can see the impact of hop latent

69
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,560
on the production of of tricomes they're

70
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,518
smaller and they're um not as welld

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,799
developed as as they should

72
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,920
be and in fact when you look at it under

73
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,519
the scanning electron microscope you

74
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,958
will see that um healthy compared to

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,560
infected the actual triome numbers

76
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,000
aren't different what you see is a is a

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,598
smaller development of the of the triome

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,360
glands or the heads and as you'll see in

79
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,878
a minute uh reduced production of of the

80
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,840
cannabinoids so there's a direct impact

81
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:39,518
on triome development as a result of

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,200
infection by um hopen so here it is a

83
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,959
dramatic comparison uh the same variety

84
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:48,000
of the same genotype uh infected versus

85
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,759
healthy the uh the

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,079
healthy large glandular heads full of

87
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,679
cannabinoids compared to the

88
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,439
shriveled um shrunken heads that are in

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,079
hop lat and virid infected plants and

90
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,878
these are at the same magnification so

91
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,239
not just uh reduction in size but also

92
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,438
reduction in volume and obviously this

93
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,280
has commercial impact to Growers because

94
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:17,439
in Canada anyway uh THC levels are

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,639
driving the economic um value of of

96
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,639
cannabis and so here's some data to

97
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,759
illustrate not just the the triome um

98
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,519
head size but also the the length of the

99
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,960
stocks is reduced and of course the most

100
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,240
important uh feature is THC content and

101
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,239
as you see here on the right uh T

102
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,560
content goes down from approximately 18%

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,840
in this genotype to about 11% so almost

104
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,399
a 40% reduction in the production of of

105
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:49,638
THC specifically so again um not really

106
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,359
sure what the impact is on the tricomes

107
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,400
directly could be uh an indirect effect

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,319
with poor growth or there could be a

109
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:01,159
shutdown in in some of the metabolic

110
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:03,399
pathways uh leading up to THC production

111
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,520
um detection of HL andyroid is fairly

112
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,719
straightforward uh most commercial Labs

113
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:12,079
have developed uh PCR primers and kits

114
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,039
that will detect this thyroid 256 base

115
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,560
pairs and as you heard in the first talk

116
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,478
this morning uh you get the the diers

117
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,639
the monomers the diers the trimers and

118
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:25,199
so on we tend to see um this multiple

119
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:29,280
banding pattern in very susceptible and

120
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,160
highly infected plants um which suggests

121
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,918
that the application is going at a at a

122
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,160
pretty good rate and these these diers

123
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:39,079
and triers accumulate as a result uh you

124
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,199
notice in this plant that the virid is

125
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,079
everywhere uh going from the lower Leaf

126
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,520
to the middle Leaf to the top top Leaf

127
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,959
as well as in The Roots so in this case

128
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:51,279
this is a systemically infected um

129
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,399
plant so what I'll do today is I'm going

130
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,839
to talk to you about what this viroid

131
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,439
does um how it moves first of all from

132
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,638
mother plant to cuting uh from pruning

133
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,360
wounds into stem infe infections I'm

134
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,759
going to talk about movement from stems

135
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,720
into Roots uh from Roots throughout the

136
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,800
plant causing systemic infection I'm I'm

137
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,520
going to talk about spread through water

138
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,120
a question came up earlier this morning

139
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,719
how does this thing spread naturally uh

140
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,240
it spreads through water it spreads

141
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,720
through flowers both male and female it

142
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
spreads into tricomes it spreads into

143
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,919
seeds and as you'll see at the end uh

144
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,559
We've also confirm that tobacco and

145
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:30,038
tomato plants are susceptible uh to

146
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,800
hopen so there's a lot of material here

147
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:35,318
uh most of it is bad news in the sense

148
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,240
that this viroid uh really is a stable

149
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:41,560
entity capable of extremely rapid spread

150
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,400
uh but we will talk about management uh

151
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,160
methods as I get towards the

152
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,560
end okay so one of the major problems of

153
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,280
course is Mother plants which are used

154
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,079
to derive cuting can be systemically

155
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,119
infected as you see here all the way

156
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,120
through but yet not show any symptoms so

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,759
that mother plant isn't uh reduced in

158
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,918
size it doesn't have any physical

159
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,520
manifestation that it's infected there's

160
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,000
no stunting there's no yellowing um and

161
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,399
these plants are maintained obviously by

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,560
The Growers because that's where they

163
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:14,799
make the cuting from but yet when you

164
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,160
look at the tissues in the plant uh the

165
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,079
virid is present everywhere in the roots

166
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,120
and the leaves and the stems and so

167
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,000
on we do know and others have observed

168
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,399
too that when you take cuting from these

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,199
infected plants the cuting don't root as

170
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,799
well and so here again you see uh very

171
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,478
small root production uh as opposed to

172
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,560
the the um the healthy cutting and and

173
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,360
there's some theories about that um

174
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,399
certainly um gene silencing and and

175
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,759
other mechanisms that would explain

176
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,719
reduced root growth could be uh

177
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,479
occurring in these plants and so when

178
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,319
you start out with a cutting that has um

179
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,758
fewer Roots then clearly it's not going

180
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:58,039
to be a plant that yields as

181
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,080
well um this shows you the the influence

182
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:04,038
of cuting from three different genotypes

183
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:06,959
14 days after rooting was initiated on

184
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,918
transmission of the vroid and lo and

185
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,799
behold every single cutting from every

186
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,158
single genotype that started from an

187
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,280
infected mother is infected with hopl

188
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:18,000
and vroid you can see the very very

189
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,598
consistent Banning patterns and so um

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,959
this is obviously a very very major uh

191
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,878
concern for growers in that your cuting

192
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,079
from an infected mother are all going to

193
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,520
be infected um if the plant was systemic

194
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,360
initially So within 14 days after the

195
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:36,679
cuting are initiated we can take the

196
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,839
roots and every one of them has hop

197
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,759
Len we've also done mechanical

198
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,320
transmission studies and what we do here

199
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,799
is uh try to emulate what Growers would

200
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,720
do and that is when they take cuting

201
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,799
with shears they leave a wound site such

202
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,560
as that and that would be a practical

203
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:55,159
way to demonstrate transmission and so

204
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:59,278
we did that we took infectious sap and

205
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,879
um added it to the O exposed cut stem

206
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,720
and and monitored the spread of the

207
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,278
vroid and what you see here is that uh

208
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,278
at points 1 and

209
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,278
six

210
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,200
whoops so01 being the top of the plant

211
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,320
and six being the roots are the two

212
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,519
areas that first picked up the vroid

213
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
when the inoculation was made roughly

214
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,679
here so little bit of spread apparently

215
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,039
up into this area but mostly down into

216
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,159
the roots as you see here in number six

217
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,679
so this is after 2 weeks and then when

218
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,480
you monitor this over time uh what you

219
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,759
start to see at four weeks is that we

220
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,440
starting to see much more um spread of

221
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,159
the viroid not just now into the roots

222
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,640
which is the arrows but also into the

223
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,039
leaves so During the period of 2 to 4

224
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,919
weeks it's now spreading uh from the

225
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,679
bottom of the plant up into the rest of

226
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:54,078
the foliage in that in that particular

227
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,599
direction regardless of the the genotype

228
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,239
that you that you

229
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,759
use and then when you get to six weeks

230
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,919
uh every single part the plant is

231
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,600
infected so once again very uniform uh

232
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:10,000
infection here in different genotypes

233
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,480
over time L is leaf and R is root so

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,480
here's the theory then is if you

235
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,600
introduce it here at a point of

236
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,159
inoculation you are going to see a

237
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,360
downward spread which is the yellow

238
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,120
arrows once it gets down in the roots in

239
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,639
two weeks you're going to see upward

240
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,240
spread uh the red arrows and depending

241
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,519
on where you sample in a systemic plant

242
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,919
uh 4 weeks you'll see it up here and

243
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,560
then 6 weeks

244
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,559
it's uh through the entire plant this

245
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,759
does vary by genotype it varies by

246
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,078
environment it varies by other factors

247
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:42,278
but this indicates that in a mother

248
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:46,120
plant um from a cutting in 6 weeks that

249
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:46,120
plant's going to be um systemically

250
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,200
infected and and this is not um

251
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,439
different from what You' see in the

252
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,680
literature with regard to how viruses

253
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,519
and viroids spread from a given point of

254
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,239
inoculation you can see the arrow some

255
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,519
of the arrows going up but primarily

256
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,240
going down into the root Zone and then

257
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,278
up back into the tissues and so this

258
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,519
reflects flow transport through the flo

259
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,120
as well as transport through the

260
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,278
plasmodesmata from cell to cell very

261
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,639
consistent U with what's known for other

262
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:21,240
viruses and in viroids in in in

263
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,278
Plants we don't think that mechanical

264
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,600
transmission and that is a lateral

265
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,399
spread is a big deal or important in in

266
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,879
this vroid cannabis so this just shows

267
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,078
the systemic spread from inoculation two

268
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:36,360
plants right next to one another rubbing

269
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,359
against another a person touching this

270
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,079
plant moving over to this plant we don't

271
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,399
see a lot of transmission in that

272
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,278
fashion which is really really good news

273
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,720
because this is not a TMV this doesn't

274
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,320
spread like TMV it appears that it does

275
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,160
need a pretty good wound sight on a stem

276
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,480
or as you'll see later on in the root in

277
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,360
order for it to transmit mechanical

278
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,360
transmission through simply um rubbing

279
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
or or plants being next to one one

280
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,360
another does not seem to transmit this

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,920
viroid and that would explain what

282
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,759
Growers have seen they don't see these

283
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,759
outbreaks as a result of um mechanical

284
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,480
transmission okay so this is just a

285
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,959
summary uh pruning wounds seem to be

286
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,759
very important uh physical abrasions of

287
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,319
leaves plants brushing up against one

288
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,879
another does not seem to be important

289
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,399
for spread and uh certainly pruning

290
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,198
tools seem to be the most likely way in

291
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,159
which this vir is spreading uh in a in a

292
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:31,679
um cannabis facility

293
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,719
the other thing we wanted to demonstrate

294
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,958
was that um root transmission uh is

295
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,399
possible so what we did here was we took

296
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,439
an infected plant and a healthy plant

297
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,559
grew them in these cloners they were

298
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,320
physically separated from one another

299
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,078
except for the hydroponic solution that

300
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,399
was was floating around these plants and

301
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,958
within two weeks the plant on the Right

302
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,278
started to pick up the uh the vroid

303
00:12:52,958 --> 00:13:00,198
suggesting that a movement through the

304
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,198
nutrient solution was was possible

305
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,799
we repeated the experiment in the

306
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,799
greenhouse environment and here infected

307
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,240
plants healthy plant physically

308
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,679
separated we flooded this tray three

309
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,519
times a day or twice a day and monitored

310
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:18,039
to see spread and within um 2 weeks 20%

311
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,120
spread uh occurred from the infected

312
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:23,439
root system over to the the other side

313
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,480
20% is significant when you have a

314
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
million

315
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,000
plants um it may not sound like a lot in

316
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
terms of numbers but it's pretty

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,799
significant

318
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,879
so this vir is probably getting sloughed

319
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,359
off in root cells maybe in in the root

320
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,399
cap in the root Zone uh we don't think

321
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,039
that it's necessarily viruses that are

322
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,919
exuded out or viroid that's exuded out

323
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,719
it's probably fragments of roots that

324
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,838
you see here floating around in the

325
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,240
nutrient solution that is allowing this

326
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,440
viroid to um to

327
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,480
spread we've also detected HBL vroid in

328
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,480
many places in the growing facility uh

329
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,800
this area here under the root Zone on

330
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,000
the table is contains hopl and vroid

331
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,679
these emitters on on the irrigation

332
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,720
system has hopl and vroid and certainly

333
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,439
root fragments that come off the plants

334
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,360
have hop late vroid recirculated water

335
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,480
as I'll show you in the next slide also

336
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,800
has presence of the vroid so this thing

337
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,800
moves quite well on the surface of

338
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,679
tables uh on between plants that are

339
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:27,198
being uh shared with the same irrigation

340
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:30,799
system and here you see a

341
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,958
recirculated um irri water very faint

342
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:36,799
but positive bands showing that the

343
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,799
vroid is present in in this

344
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,799
material we've also done qpcr with this

345
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,919
with this um work and as I mentioned

346
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:47,439
earlier um the area right underneath the

347
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,958
the the slabs of of of the plants right

348
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,360
here the reading on a QP s machine was

349
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,838
around 25 which is fairly significant

350
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,399
almost equivalent to what you see in the

351
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,079
roots and then swabs of the of the table

352
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,440
surface water samples residual water

353
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:05,399
water and recirculated water are all

354
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,399
positive for for hop plate and

355
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,759
vroid and this is our our estimate to

356
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,920
try to um determine exactly how many

357
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,759
viroid particles we're dealing with this

358
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:19,360
was done with synthetically derived uh

359
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,879
RNA trying to explain how the qpcr

360
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,079
readings correlate with viroid

361
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,559
concentrations and so approximately a

362
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,318
qpcr reading of around 20 gives you

363
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,078
about a million vroid particles so we're

364
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:35,399
looking at at least 100,000 or so

365
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:37,838
particles or or fragments of RNA present

366
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,839
on those

367
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,278
tabletops again uh going through the

368
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,318
literature it's not surprising there are

369
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,318
many viruses and even viroids that are

370
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:50,479
transmitted through water a potato

371
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:53,120
spinal tubroid for example uh when you

372
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,800
grow these plants next to one another

373
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,720
healthy plant here or infected plant

374
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,519
here healthy plant there you will see

375
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,120
lateral transmission through Roots

376
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,959
through water water through various

377
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,560
other systems and so it's not unique to

378
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,958
this particular viroid or to this

379
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,599
particular host pathogen system other

380
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,239
viroids do similar things uh as far as

381
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,399
movement through

382
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,560
water we were surprised with this

383
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,480
finding this is um a situation where um

384
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,439
my student because they want wanted to

385
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,240
save on on the environment and economics

386
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,959
they used these disposable pestl which

387
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,120
is supposed to be used once and thrown

388
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,638
away but they decided to hang on to them

389
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,759
and autoclave them and after every cycle

390
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,240
of autoclaving we check to see whether

391
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,919
the hot blade vir is present and lo and

392
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,000
behold a cycle of autoclaving does not

393
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:44,078
destroy this particular vroid we also

394
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,278
found it in the buckets that we use to

395
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,599
store our nutrient solution we found it

396
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,879
on the surface of these handheld uh

397
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,560
watering cans these are all positive for

398
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,480
hot late and viroids so something to be

399
00:16:52,559 --> 00:17:00,838
aware this thing does stick around on

400
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,839
utensils and um equipment in the lab

401
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,279
okay so what happens when a cannabis

402
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,640
plant goes into flower um as most of you

403
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,199
probably know um in order to flower a

404
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,720
cannabis plant you have to move it over

405
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,439
to 1212 cycle and we were able to show

406
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,679
that when you do that look at the

407
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,439
presence of HBL and vroid FL FL stands

408
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,319
for um for

409
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,360
flour so much so that when you compare

410
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,318
the movement of H viroid in a plant

411
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,119
that's flowering compared to a plant

412
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:31,440
that's still in vegetative growth after

413
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:34,199
um after 2 weeks you do find it in the

414
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,798
roots at 24 hours but look what happens

415
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,440
in the 121 12 cycle every single part of

416
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,839
the plant is infected so something has

417
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,080
happened in in the process of flowering

418
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,798
the physiological changes that occur

419
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,279
during a a a flowering cycle that

420
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:52,359
actually causes this viroid to spread

421
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:55,918
and multiply and replicate

422
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:58,319
considerably um into these flowering

423
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,720
tissues and here again is just some data

424
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:03,480
qpcr data to show you that when you look

425
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,120
at a plant that's under a 122 cycle the

426
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,038
qpcr numbers are way way lower than they

427
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,639
are when the plant is under 24-hour

428
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:13,158
cycle so again suggesting the shift over

429
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,759
the physiological shift into flowering

430
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,880
is causing this vroid to replicate to

431
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,879
move and potentially become uh

432
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,558
symptomatic we looked at dried flower

433
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,639
samples flowers samples that would be um

434
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,240
making their way to Market and guess

435
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,240
what

436
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,720
hot PL vir is present not surprising if

437
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,079
it's moving up into the flowers it's

438
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,440
also going to be in the dried flower

439
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,199
samples so as I mentioned earlier these

440
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,720
are the tricomes that are produced on

441
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,880
flowering tissues of cannabis plants and

442
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,720
so the next question we asked can this

443
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,039
thing move into the

444
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,200
tricomes so we made collections of

445
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:57,038
tricomes uh from infected plants as well

446
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,919
as from healthy plants and uh looked at

447
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,079
them to make sure they are pure TR

448
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,559
preparations as you see here we then

449
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:08,158
extracted the RNA to see where the hopl

450
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:10,319
virid was present and lo and behold hopl

451
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,480
viroid is present in the tricomes that

452
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,879
are extracted from these plants that are

453
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,200
infected here are the triome glands a

454
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,200
beautiful image showing you these bulbs

455
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,600
that happen and the arrow basically

456
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,440
tells you that as the as a as a plant

457
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,959
goes into flower the the vroid is

458
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,519
actually moving along uh into these

459
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,360
particular tissues which is perhaps not

460
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:33,359
so surprising given how how easy it is

461
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,279
to spread in the plant but still quite

462
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,319
surprising for

463
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,440
us and again if you look at the

464
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:42,879
literature one uh can find lots of

465
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,480
reports of where triome formation is a

466
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,480
photosynthetic SN there's a lot of

467
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,839
energy demand that goes into these

468
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,839
triome development and it's it's simply

469
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,519
a matter of the vroid finding its way

470
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:58,199
through there as the photosynthates flow

471
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:59,599
from the bra tissues into tricomes that

472
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,759
would explain and why we were seeing so

473
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,158
much of it

474
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:06,158
there so much so that even the resin

475
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,159
that is extracted from these infected

476
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,760
tricomes has hopl and virid in it so

477
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,440
these are different resin extraction

478
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:16,960
methods mostly uh CO2 extraction and the

479
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,600
virid is present I don't know what the

480
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,720
significance of that is but it at least

481
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,439
tells you how stable this thing is it

482
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,038
can make its way through a CO2

483
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,038
extraction

484
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,798
protocol okay so the the vroid does move

485
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,360
into male flowers if you induce male

486
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,279
flowering in cannabis plants uh you will

487
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,319
see the the presence of these the bands

488
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,000
not just in the male flowers but also in

489
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,359
the anthers so it does move into male

490
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,679
flowers uh it's also present in the

491
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,519
pollen these are pollen grains here's

492
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,960
the presence of the vroid in pollen

493
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,038
grains in anthers as well as the actual

494
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,558
pollen

495
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:56,558
itself and of course if it's there it's

496
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,558
going to be in the seed it's also

497
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:02,599
present in both hemp seed as well as

498
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:05,519
cannabis seed there's a 256 band a very

499
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:08,399
high frequency of transmission into

500
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,879
seeds and uh you do see an impact of the

501
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,559
vroid on seed development which again is

502
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,559
not surprising these are seeds from an

503
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,798
infected plant seeds from a healthy

504
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,879
plant these are not going to they're not

505
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:20,759
going to germinate and grow as well as

506
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,840
you would in the in the healthy so it is

507
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,879
devastating in that

508
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,839
regard um we also had some some samples

509
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,278
of thps that were feeding on an infected

510
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,599
plant and when we crushed up the thrips

511
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:35,119
and did an RNA extraction it's present

512
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,719
in thrips so maybe thrips are

513
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,719
transmitting uh hopl viroid it's it's

514
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,159
quite

515
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,919
possible we germinated some of these

516
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,240
infected seeds and I I wanted to show

517
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,559
you that as the seeds start to germinate

518
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,240
the virid is present on the seed coat

519
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,558
and the first place we find it actually

520
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,720
is in the leaves in the calans and as

521
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,879
the leaves develop when the leaves are

522
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,919
fully formed it then moves down into the

523
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,880
roots so you don't see it early on on

524
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,520
here you see it in there and then you

525
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,080
see it move down from a ceiling so you

526
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,720
do see seed transmission as a result of

527
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,599
infected

528
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,440
seed um so these are some of the

529
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,839
experiments we have underway uh looking

530
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,798
at Host range uh these are the various

531
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:19,240
plants we're looking at and um the way

532
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,400
we did the inoculations was simply uh

533
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,120
make a cutting or remove a leaf on a

534
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,080
tobacco plant or a tomato plant and add

535
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:29,839
the sap to these uh injured tissues and

536
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,278
over time you do see the presence of

537
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,759
hopl and vroid uh in tobacco leaves this

538
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:37,798
is after 3 weeks and in tobacco Roots

539
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,079
after 11 weeks it moves a lot slower in

540
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,759
these plants than it does in cannabis

541
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,319
where you see movement in about 2 weeks

542
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,879
this takes a lot longer and similarly in

543
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:49,158
tomato it takes about 8 weeks before we

544
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,600
actually see high levels of the viroid

545
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,840
in The Roots but certainly

546
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,038
experimentally um the virid can infect

547
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,759
these plants what does it mean from a

548
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,319
practical perspective I don't know um

549
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,319
I'm not going to put the word out there

550
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,599
that Growers should freak out and worry

551
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:08,000
about alternative hosts not yet these

552
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:09,959
are Under experimental inoculation

553
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,440
conditions okay so finally I'm just

554
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,759
going to talk quickly about um factors

555
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,120
that um these destabilize hop lat and

556
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,759
vroid we looked at a number of things uh

557
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:23,000
temperatures UVC treat uh various

558
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,879
treatments of various chemicals as well

559
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,558
as addition of various enzymes I'm just

560
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,520
going to go through this uh fairly

561
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:33,278
quickly here um this is where we tested

562
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:36,558
infected roots with various treatments

563
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:38,798
vercon zerotol bleach hypochlorous acid

564
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,759
at these concentrations the vroid is

565
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,359
extremely stable in the roots and you

566
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:47,000
cannot eradicate it from those

567
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,678
tissues we looked at temperature once

568
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,038
again going from 30° all the way to 70

569
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,840
Centigrade 15 to 30 minute exposures the

570
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,440
viroid is still stable the upper bands

571
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,678
here which are probably the linear bands

572
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,600
are removed but but notice heat stable

573
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:07,840
extremely heat stable we looked at dried

574
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:12,319
sap and leaves survival up to 4 weeks

575
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:14,720
just lying down on the tabletop or um in

576
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,000
the in the lab and here we also looked

577
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
at UVC

578
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,599
treatment um again very stable you can't

579
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,200
destroy this vroid with

580
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:27,480
UVC and of course if you add enzymes

581
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,200
such as rnases you can uh remove the

582
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,038
viroid totally this is RNA a which

583
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,240
Cleaves as an endo nucleus enzyme and

584
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,720
you can certainly eradicate um hop

585
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,880
latent with

586
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,480
that okay so finally um we wanted to

587
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,520
develop a methodology that would allow

588
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,440
us to test various uh chemicals for

589
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,079
destruction of hlate En viroids so this

590
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,720
just shows you we extracted sap we

591
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,319
collected it in an endorf tube added

592
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,360
particular chemicals that we wanted to

593
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:58,119
test to see if it destroyed the RNA and

594
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:00,439
then we run a gel to see what the effect

595
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:02,359
would be and the results are presented

596
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,000
in the following slides these are

597
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:07,959
various treatments that we looked at

598
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,200
Veron bleach um rnas and various other

599
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,079
things the arrow points specifically to

600
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,720
bleach uh 10% bleach has a destructive

601
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:19,000
effect on the RNA

602
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,519
itself here's again a whole series of

603
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,558
these treatments so this was the

604
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,240
Infectious sap these were the treatments

605
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,519
that were added and where you see the

606
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,519
absence of bands again corresponds to

607
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:33,240
bleach uh 10% for 2 minutes 20% bleach

608
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,079
for 2 minutes 20% for 1 minute and the

609
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,038
RNA is

610
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:39,759
destroyed and then we also looked at

611
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,960
hypochlorous Acid so hypochlorous acid

612
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:45,278
uh does destroy the virant notice that

613
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,159
Veron does not no effect on the RNA at

614
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,038
all it's mostly the bleach and the

615
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,320
hypochlorous

616
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:54,119
acid okay so conclusions this viroid

617
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,359
spreads extremely well through

618
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,599
cuting um it spreads to the plant

619
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,599
becomes systemic it's present in female

620
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:03,439
flowers it's present in

621
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:06,359
tricomes uh it's present in male flowers

622
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,120
it's present in seeds it causes a huge

623
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:10,959
reduction in THC

624
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:13,839
levels um it's very stable in dried

625
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,720
leaves it's stable in sap and the only

626
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:20,119
way we could destroy the um RNA was

627
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,480
exposure to 10% bleach and 100,000 PPM

628
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,479
hypochloric acid for a minute so

629
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,159
disinfection of tools are going to be

630
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,880
relying on these two particular

631
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,600
chemicals in particular and we do know

632
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,799
that there are significant genotypic

633
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,240
differences in response to hopl and

634
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,200
viroids so that requires a little

635
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,120
additional work um some questions we

636
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,200
don't know what levels of virid actually

637
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:45,158
are needed to cause infection is it a

638
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,840
thousand is it 10,000 is a million um

639
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,360
and how do the viroid levels correlate

640
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:51,038
with disease symptoms or latency and

641
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,319
again of course what environmental

642
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,558
factors are are required so I'm going to

643
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,879
end here once again with the

644
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:00,038
acknowledgement of the sponsors we're

645
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,320
out time so I'm going to be available uh

646
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:04,960
during coffee break or during lunch for

647
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,678
any questions that come up and so um I

648
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,600
hope I haven't depressed you all with

649
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,759
this this news but um it is a challenge

650
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,980
but we'll get to it we'll figure it out

651
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,769
thank you

652
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,769
[Applause]
