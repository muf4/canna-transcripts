[Music]

2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,800
um all right so I was wonder if you

3
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:22,640
could kind of just like take me through

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:25,118
the process of creating a new strain um

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,359
like are you selecting the plants with a

6
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,278
specific trait in mind or are you just

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
taking two plants Crossing them and kind

8
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,159
of seeing what comes out and then

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,640
following the trail from there how does

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:39,279
that work yeah so I mean each strain is

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,799
different um I give you an example um I

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,679
brought back a a cut from AK-47 of AK-47

13
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,839
from a family farm in Durango Mexico um

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:51,640
we got it back um and got it initiated

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,280
we then crossed it with a very popular

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,600
Michigan strain you've probably heard of

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,719
it Oreos um but to create our new strain

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,680
uh which we called cream 47 we had to

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,200
take the Oreos get it to an F3 and then

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,840
we took our AK-47 which we knew is a

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,320
land race train and we did that initial

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,759
upfront cross when we do that cross when

23
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,839
creating cream 47 we had a list of

24
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,959
markers we wanted to hit we wanted to

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,320
hit high triome density we wanted the

26
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:25,438
bag peel to be there we wanted some of

27
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,559
that creamy kind of Oreo um flavor to

28
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,719
come over from the Oreos uh in that

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,200
cross so in some cases it's doing a stem

30
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,478
rub on the male in some cases we're

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,759
looking at internodal spacing you know

32
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,879
do we want a indicia dominant plant do

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,359
we want a sativa dominant plant do we

34
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,519
want a true hybrid um and then we're

35
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,560
also implementing like I said before

36
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,438
which genotypes and which plants are

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,399
most resistant towards certain uh plant

38
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:56,078
pressures um so I mean it's hard to give

39
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,519
a breeder a a rundown of an exact

40
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,559
formula for what our targets are um but

41
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,840
it's always changing I mean for each

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,759
strain we have a different goal um we

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,759
just developed a strain push OG which

44
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,520
our goal for that was to be very drought

45
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,719
resistant uh very very drought resistant

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,599
and to be a light feeder so yeah I mean

47
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,919
it's hard to nail down exactly what

48
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:21,079
we're looking for for each strain but

49
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,518
bag appeal because of the way the market

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,480
is right now and the things that are

51
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,599
trending in the industry bag appeal is

52
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,799
always a box that we have to check

53
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,479
because at at the end of the day the

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,239
grower needs to like what they see in

55
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,560
the canopy and the consumer needs to

56
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,878
like what they see in the bag yeah for

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,039
sure so now when you you were talking

58
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,679
about doing the initial cross with uh I

59
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,759
think it was the F3 and then the land

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,000
race and then so how many different

61
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,560
seeds are you popping how many plants

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,519
are you sort of evaluating and sort of

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,959
how does it scale from there yeah so I

64
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,560
mean if we're doing if we're hunting

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,680
through seed we're doing about 200 um as

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,158
I told you before we're a small indoor

67
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
craft sealed facility uh where we're not

68
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,759
Outdoors we're not in a greenhouse we're

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,560
in an indoor sealed environment that way

70
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,239
we don't have any worries of any

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,199
cross-contamination or uh foreign pollen

72
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,959
coming in that we're unaware of um but

73
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,560
for what we were just speaking about the

74
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,439
F3 and then you're taking the land race

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,680
AK-47 once we make that cross we will

76
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,479
hunt out about from maybe 200 seed um

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,319
we'll do that because of the stability

78
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,798
with both lines we're working with all

79
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:32,479
we need is about 200 seed to find that

80
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,040
genotype that we want to then sterilize

81
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,039
um again we we use um axillary node

82
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,719
culture so we're actually doing a micro

83
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,280
splice taking that node sterilizing it

84
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,239
and then getting it into vitro um and

85
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,640
then depending on how quick we need to

86
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,759
make seed for our new line it might stay

87
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,839
there for a year it might stay there for

88
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,598
two years um and then we're we're

89
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,039
pulling it out when we need it excellent

90
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,598
so that upfront stabilization before you

91
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,878
were putting it into uh tissue culture

92
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:06,719
makes it so you don't have to to hunt as

93
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,719
many that's right that's right awesome

94
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:20,420
