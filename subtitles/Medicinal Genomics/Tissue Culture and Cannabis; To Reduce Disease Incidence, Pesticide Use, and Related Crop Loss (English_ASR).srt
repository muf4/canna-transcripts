1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:12,339
all right thank you excited to be here

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,280
appreciate you all for attending this

3
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:16,449
afternoon and excited to talk to you

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,489
about this I think it's a pretty

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:22,719
relevant topic after the talk that we

6
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:24,459
just saw been a really exciting couple

7
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,750
of days here it's a great conference I

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,730
want to say a special thanks to a

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,588
medicinal genomics and their team for

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,838
putting this together I've spent a lot

11
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:33,670
of a lot of time here with different

12
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:35,739
folks and really enjoyed a lot of the

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,649
presentations so really honored to be

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,640
here and see the advancements in science

15
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,189
around cannabis that were making

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,409
collectively just a quick background on

17
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:46,899
myself I'm a PhD organic chemist spent

18
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:49,689
about 15 years in molecular diagnostics

19
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:51,929
human Diagnostics working on early

20
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:54,369
detection of cancer heart disease and

21
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,409
building assay technologies and

22
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:58,538
platforms to support clinical trial

23
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:00,069
submissions for drug discovery spent a

24
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,198
couple of years in food safety as well

25
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,480
working on pathogen detection platforms

26
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,519
things like Salmonella Listeria e-coli I

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,840
made the move into agriculture about

28
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:10,030
three and a half years ago to start

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,250
Front Range Biosciences and I've been

30
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,379
very fortunate in that time to assemble

31
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,150
a world-class team of folks that have

32
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:17,798
probably collectively over a hundred

33
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,189
years of experience in commercial

34
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,118
agriculture agronomy tissue culture some

35
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:23,978
of the things we'll talk about today

36
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,390
plant breeding and so a lot of what I'm

37
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:26,679
going to talk about here represents

38
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,840
really their their collective knowledge

39
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,299
and and some of the work that they're

40
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,270
that they're doing for us at at Front

41
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,430
Range Biosciences a quick background on

42
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:38,140
the company just to give you a little

43
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,700
bit of context for why I'm up here and

44
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,728
talking to you about this this topic

45
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,290
today is we there's two parts to our

46
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:46,090
business the first is our clean stock

47
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,909
nursery program which is where we use

48
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,969
tissue culture to produce clean healthy

49
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:54,159
disease-free plants and we push them out

50
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:56,019
to growers in a production setting to

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,969
support their their growing and

52
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:59,739
production efforts the other part of our

53
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:01,419
business is is on the varietal

54
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,158
development side we have a plant

55
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,890
breeding program and we're combining

56
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,659
traditional plant breeding with methods

57
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,240
like next-generation sequencing and new

58
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,580
technologies to improve the process and

59
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,600
hopefully develop new varieties that

60
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,410
help farmers realize better yields

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,099
improvements on their and their crops

62
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:20,099
that they grow

63
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:24,859
there's two crops that we currently work

64
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:26,839
with really three we worked with

65
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,670
cannabis including both industrial hemp

66
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,300
as well as the high THC version or

67
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:33,979
marijuana and we also work in coffee

68
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,390
today I'm going to be be focused on on

69
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:37,639
cannabis and and tissue culture

70
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:40,339
propagation we have facilities in

71
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:42,619
Colorado for hemp and in Wisconsin for

72
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,810
him and then in California is where we

73
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,379
do our work in marijuana and and coffee

74
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,659
propagation so why are we all here

75
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:53,269
and I have to admit realizing my slide

76
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:55,789
is about eight months old in Jeffrey's

77
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,219
slide or dr. Reiter slide earlier I need

78
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:59,419
to update my numbers here but you know

79
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,879
there's there's evidently over a

80
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:04,189
thousand unique small molecules in in

81
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,780
this plant and it's it's why we think

82
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:07,519
it's the world's next commodity crop

83
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,519
it's also got a lot of potential as a

84
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,409
functional food and nutritional value

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,480
things like polyunsaturated fatty acids

86
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:16,609
that are balanced pretty much ideally

87
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,379
for human consumption between omega

88
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,989
sixes and Omega 3s it's also a great

89
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,219
protein source with the hemp grain and

90
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,110
then lastly there's fibers for

91
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:27,049
industrial use so it's it's a pretty

92
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,640
amazing crop and it's going to take the

93
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:32,420
collective work of a lot of us in this

94
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,429
room to help scale the industry one of

95
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:36,919
the big challenges in a new crop and it

96
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,390
came - every crop before this one was

97
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,828
that the supply chain is just not

98
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:42,589
consistent yet and it's going to take a

99
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:44,629
lot of time and resource and an effort

100
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,170
to get it there so just like every other

101
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:50,180
crop we need materials and inputs that

102
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:52,219
are high-quality high-volume we

103
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,810
obviously need plants that are that are

104
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,129
clean we just heard a little bit about

105
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,709
some of the challenges with disease

106
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,389
pesticides are another big issue and we

107
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,840
also need it to be uniform right to

108
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:04,179
support manufacturing applications and

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,099
inefficient production processes

110
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,450
unfortunately due to prohibition most

111
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,370
cannabis growers and most cannabis

112
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,719
companies and and whatever part of the

113
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,890
supply chain you're and you just haven't

114
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,930
had access to a lot of these

115
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,639
technologies and so we're all scrambling

116
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,959
right now to build them to bring

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,279
together a supply chain to meet the

118
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,819
incredible demand that we're seeing

119
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,199
around the world now so let's dig into

120
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:25,668
the canvas supply chain for a minute

121
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,589
today I'm gonna really talk about the

122
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:30,529
nursery and how tissue culture can be

123
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:31,848
used to help support the supply chain

124
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:34,000
from the very beginning which is at the

125
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:36,670
nursery you know when we look at the

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,319
total supply chain you know the genetics

127
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,000
of the varieties that go into the

128
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,500
nursery and then those plants go into

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,589
production farmers and then they go to

130
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,189
extractors and processors and

131
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,319
manufacturers and all these other

132
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:49,180
different pieces the nursery is really

133
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,620
at the beginning and so what I'm

134
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,939
hopefully going to do today is talk

135
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,670
about ways that you can potentially

136
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:58,839
build a strong foundation for the supply

137
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,970
chain so when we look at a traditional

138
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,339
cannabis nursery this is typically what

139
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,350
you would see and a lot of this resulted

140
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:07,479
from prohibition and people being forced

141
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:11,220
to grow in warehouses and garages and

142
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,020
and you know clandestine spaces and so

143
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,730
what you see is is that it's all

144
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,990
vegetative propagation there's some

145
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,629
other plants that have been maintained

146
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,759
often for decades and during those

147
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,620
decades you're simply building up a huge

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,569
pathogen load whether it's pests whether

149
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,250
it's some of the molds and mildews that

150
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,469
we just saw a lot of amazing pictures of

151
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,290
you know they're there they're gonna

152
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,310
simply find their way into your plant

153
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,330
the other thing that you've seen

154
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,069
traditional nurseries is they're

155
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:38,529
typically right in the production space

156
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,110
so you typically see them in the same

157
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:43,209
facility same location and if you look

158
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,490
to other crops and and other large

159
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:47,560
agricultural companies that produce

160
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,939
specialty or high-value crops their

161
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,439
nurseries are always separate from their

162
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,219
production facilities and there's a

163
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,959
reason for that

164
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,720
it's so that you can minimize your risk

165
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,779
of catastrophic loss due to an infection

166
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,550
that might take out your entire crop the

167
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:03,309
other thing is is you build up an insect

168
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,110
in pathogen load over time and as you

169
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,509
try to scale up your production efforts

170
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,340
you're really limited in how quickly you

171
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,529
can do it because you might try to get

172
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:13,299
to five ten fifteen thousand plants and

173
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:14,918
that's somewhat manageable try going to

174
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,540
a hundred thousand or a million plants

175
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,879
or even several million plants under

176
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,620
management and cultivation and trying to

177
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,250
keep these pests and pathogens at bay

178
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,780
becomes a real challenge so I think this

179
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,149
really sets the stage for something

180
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:29,739
that's come for many other crops before

181
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:32,829
this one and that's a virus and

182
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,870
outbreaks so many of the same pests that

183
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:37,599
infect other crops in fact cannabis

184
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,069
thrips a fits you know they're all

185
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,780
carrying or they're all considered

186
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,990
vectors for lots of different viruses

187
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:45,699
and as you begin to scale up a crop your

188
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,079
risk of virus outbreak goes up

189
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,860
exponentially it's the same thing in

190
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,389
people right

191
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,160
the more people travel around the more

192
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,529
we get things like flu virus spreading

193
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,600
it's the same for plants and so we're

194
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,819
gonna see that risk you know continue to

195
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,710
grow as more and more folks come into

196
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,019
the industry more and more markets come

197
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:05,889
online and people are moving plants seed

198
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:07,539
product all over the world unfortunately

199
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,129
some of these go undetected they can

200
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,020
live dormant they can rear their ugly

201
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,569
heads when a plant gets stressed there's

202
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:15,419
there's lots of different of things and

203
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,769
honestly a lot of it's still unknown the

204
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,420
other thing is viruses and outbreaks

205
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:21,129
will lead to regulatory changes which

206
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,910
can sometimes [ __ ] companies in the

207
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:26,139
short-term as they have to face you know

208
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,060
strict regulations on how they can move

209
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,279
their plants around I've listed a few

210
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,430
crops you know it's it's whether it's

211
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,889
fruit berries cassava potato sugar cane

212
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,259
they've all had their there they're

213
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:40,300
tough times with things like virus and I

214
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,480
think we'll we'll certainly see this

215
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,129
happen in cannabis at some point too

216
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,770
here's an example from blueberries so

217
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:51,639
blueberries really exploded over the

218
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:54,339
last 20 years with with a lot of demand

219
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,229
and on the consumer side and what you

220
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:57,279
saw as you spread blueberry plants

221
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,210
around and started growing them in

222
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,669
different regions throughout the

223
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:03,339
northwest and the Midwest is there were

224
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,740
viral outbreaks and some of them were

225
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:07,599
pretty devastating and it cost farmers a

226
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,189
lot of time and money and then it

227
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,950
eventually led to regulatory changes

228
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:14,949
things like phytosanitary standards to

229
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,930
move plants across state lines and and

230
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:21,789
other regulations too to try and

231
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:24,610
mitigate this problem there's over 900

232
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,010
viruses known to infect plants so far

233
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,710
there's to my knowledge and and and once

234
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:32,590
again this industry is advancing so fast

235
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:33,939
as I mentioned earlier but there's we

236
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,190
think there's about there's two right

237
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,460
now that are known to infect cannabis or

238
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,320
hemp specifically a mosaic and a streak

239
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,930
virus but there's a few others that have

240
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,510
been thought to be implicated and an

241
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:49,359
infecting this plant that I've listed up

242
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:50,799
here and the reality is though is and we

243
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,990
test for a lot of these as part of our

244
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,459
clean stock program but the reality is

245
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,799
is there's still a lot of work to do in

246
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,320
the pathology area for this crop

247
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,120
nobody really it fully understands you

248
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,860
know which viruses are in fact

249
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,919
and how do we test for him effectively

250
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,720
you know sample preparation in molecular

251
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,189
diagnostics is always a big challenge

252
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,339
and when you introduce a new sample

253
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,630
matrix ie a new crop you know there's

254
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,029
certainly going to be challenges there

255
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:18,220
and so we haven't seen a lot of positive

256
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:21,009
IDs but I don't know that that's because

257
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,440
of them not actually being there I think

258
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:27,250
it also could be a limitation of some of

259
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,760
the testing technologies the other thing

260
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,320
is is viruses are carried by pests

261
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,778
unfortunately there's no federal

262
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,060
registration for a lot of pesticides and

263
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:39,610
in this crop in particular because of

264
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:42,759
the way it gets consumed directly and

265
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,879
smoked there's a very large risk for

266
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,528
many pesticides to the consumer and so

267
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,960
it's it's really important we're already

268
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:51,759
starting to see recalls that growers

269
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,019
aren't using these pesticides on their

270
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,250
products and especially if it's getting

271
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:59,139
distilled and concentrated quick shot of

272
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,580
a study done by steep hill labs I think

273
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,169
it was actually last year now where they

274
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,509
tested a bunch of cannabis and saw that

275
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:06,399
over 80% of it was contaminated with

276
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:09,429
some type of pesticide that's that's

277
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,289
prohibited and you know this is this is

278
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:12,819
a big red flag and I think a lot of

279
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:15,610
companies have been addressing this over

280
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,589
the last six months but it gives you a

281
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,759
sense of the of the scale of the problem

282
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,200
consumers are also demanding this they

283
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,059
don't want pesticides they don't want

284
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,890
contaminants any of it on their products

285
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:29,739
whether they're consuming them for food

286
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,480
or for recreation or medicine you know

287
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,860
this is a trend that's been going on for

288
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,440
a decade and I don't expect it to change

289
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,209
anytime soon as people become more aware

290
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,890
and the internet reaches many more

291
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:41,338
people you know they're gonna demand

292
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:44,169
that you that you have clean products

293
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,430
how do we solve this well quality

294
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:47,199
systems so we can look to other

295
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:50,259
industries like Pharma molecular

296
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,850
diagnostics food safety and there's a

297
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:54,159
lot of quality systems that have already

298
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,290
been developed to try and support clean

299
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,000
manufacturing clean clean production of

300
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,649
products I've listed a few here good

301
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,080
manufacturing practices one that really

302
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,879
comes out of Pharma and it's it's it's

303
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,170
it's it's tough it's hard to actually

304
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,700
implement but a lot of companies are

305
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:09,370
trying to do this in cannabis it makes

306
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,339
me excited to see you know it's a it's a

307
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,528
great way to to ensure quality in your

308
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,720
product hasip is another one

309
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:18,759
that's used in food safety you know

310
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,999
everybody knows probably about ISO which

311
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,680
is about standards for manufacturing

312
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:25,449
environments and you know what I

313
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,248
encourage people to do and their

314
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:28,328
companies is is you know work on this

315
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:30,850
internally you know put together

316
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:32,739
documentation packages SOPs batch

317
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,319
records Quality Assurance quality

318
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,299
control systems make sure your products

319
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:39,490
are traceable you know these are all

320
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:41,399
really key things as we try to scale the

321
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,259
supply chain and and minimize our risk

322
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,970
both both for your company as well as

323
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:47,889
for the industry and then lastly make

324
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,389
sure that you're you know spending a lot

325
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,519
of time on personnel training right

326
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:53,680
you're only as good as your employees

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,419
and so if they're not well trained and

328
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,028
versed in some of these things and it's

329
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:03,068
going to be hard to to have a quality

330
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:05,740
supply chain so the solution tissue

331
00:12:03,068 --> 00:12:07,149
culture clean stock nursery program I'm

332
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,220
going to dig into that for a minute here

333
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:11,289
this is just some examples from our lab

334
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,120
it shows some plants and tissue culture

335
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:14,919
on one side and then in the greenhouse

336
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,278
and our clean stock nursery on the other

337
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:20,019
side there's a lot of advantages I'll

338
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:21,519
talk a little bit about that and then

339
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:23,828
some of the work that goes into setting

340
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,709
up tissue culture but if used properly

341
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:28,120
it can help mitigate your risk and it

342
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:31,208
can mitigate your risk of catastrophic

343
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,299
crop loss if you combine a clean stock

344
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:36,188
type program with a strong integrated

345
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:38,318
pest management program you can actually

346
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,789
minimize your need for any pesticides

347
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:41,828
you can make sure that the product

348
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:46,120
you're putting out at the end is is

349
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:48,008
clean so I've laid out some benefits and

350
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,948
some considerations for tissue culture

351
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:53,139
we get a lot of interest in this topic

352
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:55,568
and it's been a pretty hot topic in the

353
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,370
industry and you know certainly some of

354
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:58,979
the things that have been been talking

355
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,139
about here and what will dig into

356
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,970
catastrophic crop loss risk mitigation

357
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:05,980
that's really important right

358
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,319
clean materials it's disease free

359
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,629
pesticide free it allows you to store

360
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:13,448
your stock plants much more effectively

361
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:15,278
and in a cleaner safer environment it

362
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:17,229
also allows you to deploy new genetics

363
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,539
very very quickly as you can

364
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,850
you know ship these clean plants to new

365
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:23,919
locations one of the things that we've

366
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,449
started to see and and and I'm not going

367
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,149
to present any data on this hopefully

368
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:28,859
for maybe next year

369
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:30,120
we're seeing improved vigor and in some

370
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,399
varieties that have been cloned for a

371
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,100
long time that go through the program so

372
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,319
that's that's a win for the grower

373
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,420
it also helps satisfy phytosanitary

374
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,790
standards but there's a lot of

375
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,319
considerations here so a lot of people

376
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:45,209
that I talk to everybody wants to build

377
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,530
their own tissue culture lab and I don't

378
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,900
want to discourage them from doing that

379
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:50,789
but you know you should go into it with

380
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,159
eyes wide open it's it's not easy

381
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,569
there's a lot of costs associated with

382
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,000
it it's very resource and

383
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,280
labor-intensive it takes a lot longer

384
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,289
than most people realize a lot of tissue

385
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,019
culture has been used in research

386
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:05,699
settings and it's certainly valuable

387
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,860
there but to use in a production setting

388
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,360
is a very different beast the other

389
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,399
thing is is whether you're in tissue

390
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,889
culture or the greenhouse or outdoors

391
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,259
there's the risk of all types these are

392
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,809
plants this is biology they can mutate

393
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,819
at any time and you always have to

394
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:23,549
control for that so building a quality

395
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,990
system it allows you to check for true

396
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:27,179
to type and that your plants that you're

397
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,100
putting out whether they're for you or

398
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,779
for a partner or your customer that

399
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,639
there are there meeting specifications

400
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,319
the last is there's a lot of work to do

401
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,699
around pathogen testing and I've already

402
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,260
talked a little bit about that but you

403
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,570
know evaluating what pathogens need to

404
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,490
be screened for last it's a new crop for

405
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,780
tissue culture so we're just at the very

406
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,820
beginning if you look at some other

407
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,069
crops it's taken years sometimes even

408
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,750
close to a decade to build strong tissue

409
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,980
culture production systems and clean

410
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:56,610
stock standards that that help crop in

411
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,740
an industry thrive a big problem that we

412
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,759
see in tissue culture is cannabis

413
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,710
diversity so if some of you got to see

414
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,470
dr. Jonathan pages talk yesterday I'm

415
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,910
signing a paper of theirs here but you

416
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,160
know there's a huge amount of diversity

417
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:12,629
in cannabis and unfortunately we're

418
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,329
starting to understand it thanks to a

419
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:16,950
lot of work that you know folks and in

420
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,509
this room and around the world are doing

421
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,590
you know and we're working on some of

422
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:21,659
that as well it's going to take a

423
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:24,240
collective effort but the reality is is

424
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,860
right now it's still very early and so

425
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,720
what we see is that in tissue culture

426
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,210
some of them don't respond as well and

427
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,940
and there's really a lot of work to do

428
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:36,660
to better characterize our genotypes

429
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,190
three minutes real quick bacterial

430
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,839
contamination so the first part of

431
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,649
tissue culture process is to clean out

432
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,639
all of the

433
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,919
things that you just saw in the previous

434
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,509
presentation which infect your plan they

435
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,338
can be on the surface they can be inside

436
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:49,800
here's just a few examples from our lab

437
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,389
of some of the things we've seen you

438
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,188
know these bacteria can come out like I

439
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:56,220
said either from the surface or internal

440
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:57,568
to the plant tissue formal contamination

441
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,420
is another big one we see a lot of

442
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:01,860
fungus and so part of the first part of

443
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:03,509
tissue culture is to clean these out so

444
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,428
we take them through multiple multiple

445
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,769
iterations of multiplication and clean

446
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:10,318
up through the initiation process to

447
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,639
eventually get rid of this and you know

448
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:14,039
then you can start up your production

449
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,749
arm and and start releasing clean plants

450
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,639
but it can take you know six to nine

451
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:20,759
months to get through this process to

452
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,619
get rid of all of these pathogens once

453
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,539
you get through it though you take it

454
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:26,249
into a routing stage you develop healthy

455
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:28,799
roots and then you get it ready for

456
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:30,600
production so there's a couple examples

457
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,769
from our lab of some clean healthy

458
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,629
plants that have made it through the

459
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:35,039
process they've got a strong healthy

460
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:35,999
root system and they're ready to go into

461
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,969
the next stage which would be

462
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:41,550
acclimatization here's another example

463
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,129
of some really you know good healthy

464
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:45,990
specimens from our lab give you a sense

465
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,699
of what cannabis tissue culture should

466
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,829
look like and you can see nice green

467
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:52,498
healthy vigorous plants these are going

468
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:56,338
to go out and produce very you know very

469
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:57,808
quality plants for production last we'll

470
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,120
just finish up with some pictures in the

471
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,980
field these are some of our from some of

472
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,439
our hem customers and one of our field

473
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,390
trials that we ran this year with some

474
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,669
of our plants that came out of the hemp

475
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,250
tissue culture lab and our greenhouse

476
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:12,360
nursery and in Lafayette and you know

477
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,548
this is what we're all trying to achieve

478
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,619
and and this is obviously outdoor and

479
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:18,209
hip production but I could show you a

480
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:21,448
similar picture from the greenhouse and

481
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:24,630
this is the goal for for all of us

482
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:26,519
so I'll finish up here my email address

483
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,528
is here if you'd like to reach out to me

484
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,970
directly feel free I'm gonna stick

485
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:32,130
around afterwards and I think we've got

486
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,929
a really great panel coming up with a

487
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,000
few other folks on the cultivation side

488
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:39,710
that I'm gonna get to join here and in

489
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,710
about 20 minutes so thank you very much

490
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,720
[Applause]

491
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,819
we might have a quick 30 seconds of

492
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,308
second I was wanting with the tissues

493
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,928
the tissue samples or the producing that

494
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:54,490
way can you produce from a nice seed as

495
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:57,640
well and are you doing that for I'm

496
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,230
talking ham yes so yeah we have a seed

497
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,870
breeding program as well and we'll be

498
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,028
releasing some seed this year but yeah

499
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:05,139
you can certainly produce really quality

500
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:07,150
plants out of seed there's some

501
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,460
advantages and disadvantages which I'll

502
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,409
try to get to in the panel because we're

503
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,700
gonna run out of time here but and I'd

504
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:16,860
be happy to talk with you but there's

505
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,860
there's reasons for both for sure
