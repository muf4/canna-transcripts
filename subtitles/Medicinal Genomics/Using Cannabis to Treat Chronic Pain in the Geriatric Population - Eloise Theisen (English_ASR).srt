1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
about four years ago I had the pleasure

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,240
of meeting Lucy with her daughter and at

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,919
the time she was 89 years old and had

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,339
been diagnosed with advanced stage

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:13,439
dementia her dementia was so advanced

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:17,189
that she was incomprehensible with her

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:19,019
speech she was falling every day and was

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,750
now becoming a safety risk in her own

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:24,480
home and the facility where she lived

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,230
was requesting that Lucy be moved into a

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,060
memory care unit Lucy had a 40 year

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,850
history of multiple sclerosis and

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,488
migraines and insomnia she'd been using

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:40,050
dilaudid and gabapentin along with

15
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:42,750
ambien that louder how's that I was

16
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:49,289
hoping how's that all right yeah you

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:52,320
missed a really good story the end so

18
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,379
Lucy had a 40 year history of multiple

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,659
sclerosis migraines as well as insomnia

20
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,539
and she'd been using dilaudid

21
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:03,808
gabapentin and ambien to manage her

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,790
symptoms when I met with her daughter

23
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:09,298
who had durable power of healthcare and

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,460
Lucy Lucy didn't even engage with me she

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,750
couldn't focus her speech was

26
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:19,199
incomprehensible we decided to focus on

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,489
her pain and sleep I started Lucy on a

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,829
one-to-one 2.5 milligram THC and two

29
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:28,618
point five milligrams CBD capsule twice

30
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,950
a day and 10 milligrams of a one to one

31
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:34,379
at night within three months we were

32
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,259
successfully able to get Lucy off her

33
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,929
gabapentin her ambien and her dilaudid

34
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,079
and she only needed to take her high

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,920
blood pressure medications she became

36
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:49,978
alert and oriented she lost 25 pounds

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,960
she stopped falling she was sleeping

38
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:55,200
through the night and for the first time

39
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:59,188
in 40 years Lucy did not complain of

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,170
pain she had such a remarkable recovery

41
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:03,269
that her daughter was successful at

42
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:08,210
getting her diagnosis of advanced stage

43
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,210
dementia removed from her medical record

44
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:16,810
about six months after taking cannabis

45
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,750
the med tech came by one day and knocked

46
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:23,019
on her door and said Lucy I have your

47
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:26,680
marijuana and Lucy said I don't take

48
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:27,939
marijuana her daughter who had durable

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,620
power of healthcare was able to make

50
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,409
that decision for her but hadn't had

51
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,390
that conversation yet and so that opened

52
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:37,150
up the conversation and Lucy realized

53
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:39,098
that she did get her life back and so

54
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,079
she started to become an advocate at her

55
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:43,328
facility talking to other residents

56
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:47,379
about the use of cannabis for their

57
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:51,129
symptoms fast forward three years later

58
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:53,769
Lucy was turning 92 she was originally

59
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,780
from France and her daughter wanted to

60
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:59,530
surprise her with a trip to France for

61
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,180
the first time in 50 years and so Tania

62
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,180
called me and she said Eloise

63
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:09,400
how do I travel to France with moms

64
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:11,110
cannabis and I said you don't she said

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,269
what do we do and I said well we should

66
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,310
probably take her off of it and if her

67
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:18,730
symptoms return you may need to consider

68
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,650
pharmaceuticals so we did and within a

69
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:23,098
week her symptoms started to return and

70
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,900
she was placed back on gabapentin and

71
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,659
within ten days on gabapentin her speech

72
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,450
became incomprehensible again and she

73
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:34,359
started to have multiple Falls the

74
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,879
daughter was clearly frustrated took her

75
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,530
off gabapentin and sent me an email and

76
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,568
said I am gonna just mail it ahead of

77
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,669
the time to the hotel and hope it makes

78
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:46,149
it and I said please don't tell me that

79
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:49,329
I don't want to know that you're

80
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,280
smuggling drugs into France and she

81
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:55,349
laughs and then a week later I got the

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,348
email that said the eagle has landed

83
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,450
my name is Eloise Thiessen and I'm a

84
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,939
board certified adult geriatric nurse

85
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,798
practitioner I have a clinic in Walnut

86
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:08,019
Creek with a physician dr. David Ferrara

87
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,299
where we now treat patients who want to

88
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:13,780
use cannabis as a treatment modality

89
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:16,000
I've seen close to 5,500 patients and

90
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,589
within those 50 500 patients you'll see

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,738
here what I'm going to present today is

92
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,578
some of the data overall the average age

93
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:25,859
of my patient

94
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:29,650
about 76 they're primarily female at 85%

95
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,939
they've never used cannabis before and

96
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,560
as you can see they don't want to smoke

97
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,689
it and they don't want to get high and

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,110
more recently they asked me not to gain

99
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:39,968
weight or get the munchies so one of the

100
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,218
things that I recognized as a clinician

101
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:44,829
was that there's really no way for me to

102
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:46,658
collect cannabis data I looked and

103
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:49,029
looked for an electronic health record

104
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:50,500
that would help me put patient

105
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,829
information in there and start to

106
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,449
provide me with some feedback on my data

107
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:57,550
all of this data that I collected here

108
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,770
was by me going through manually

109
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,218
handwritten charts that patients had

110
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:05,288
filled out and then I was fortunate

111
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:07,990
enough to find a company that is working

112
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:11,079
on some data collection and they came in

113
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,819
and looked at about 220 of my chronic

114
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,680
pain patients and you'll see that the

115
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:19,330
the numbers are much different than my

116
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,218
overall patient population I have about

117
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:23,859
34 percent of females are coming to me

118
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:25,810
specifically for pain and about close to

119
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,960
50 of them are male and you'll see that

120
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,028
17% is blank because what we realize is

121
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,459
that it's not a mandatory field for them

122
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:35,079
to identify their gender so that is

123
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:39,489
definitely something we learned from

124
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:41,408
there is there any way you could get my

125
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,000
powerpoints a little bit bigger on here

126
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:45,490
I don't I don't need the notes after all

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,199
would you mind please because I can't

128
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:55,000
see it's funny I usually tell the joke

129
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,650
when my picture comes up because

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,649
patients asked me if that's my daughter

131
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,620
rude

132
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:12,750
apparently cannabis doesn't help with it

133
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:15,128
gray hair nor does it help with baldness

134
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:21,819
but apparently you can put it in your

135
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:23,439
attic where okay some other trends that

136
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:25,300
we identified here were whether or not

137
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,848
patients had any previous experience

138
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,338
with cannabis and in my pain population

139
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:32,528
of these 220 patients we found about

140
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:34,930
almost 35% had no previous experience

141
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:36,850
they weren't currently using it

142
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,918
and about 48 percent had at least tried

143
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,990
it at some point and again we have a

144
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:44,560
blank area because we realized that it's

145
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,660
not a mandatory field and these are some

146
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,370
of the different pain categories that

147
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,250
they identified so you'll see most

148
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,899
patients coming to me or cancer my

149
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,478
background prior to cannabis was

150
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:57,579
oncology so it's natural for patients to

151
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:00,219
come see me for symptom relief related

152
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:02,978
to cancer treatment a lot of them

153
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,620
identified it as chronic pain or other

154
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:09,219
diseases that were causing pain like

155
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:15,519
Lyme disease or lupus stenosis was also

156
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:17,770
a big category the different routes of

157
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,750
administration although 62 percent

158
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:22,599
weren't currently using it to treat

159
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,550
their pain the 37 percent that we're

160
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,030
using it most of them were using

161
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:33,759
sublingual followed by topical and then

162
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:36,008
ingestion and inhalation and when I do

163
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,810
my data collection I do do a full review

164
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,699
of symptoms so sometimes patients will

165
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,168
come to me for chronic pain but through

166
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:44,110
that review of systems I'll actually

167
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:46,329
identify other ways that cannabis may be

168
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,919
helpful for them like mood improvement

169
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:51,939
sleep anxiety many of them identified

170
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,948
cardiovascular issues so I have a lot of

171
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:57,189
patients who have high blood pressure we

172
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:59,830
know that as we age blood pressure rates

173
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:01,810
can go up I do have a lot of patients

174
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:04,209
with atrial fibrillation other

175
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,860
musculoskeletal issues urinary issues

176
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:06,908
again I have a lot of females so

177
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,330
typically that means they're having

178
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:16,029
incontinence respiratory issues like

179
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:17,740
coughing or shortness of breath so

180
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,598
chronic pain is definitely something

181
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,280
that we're all probably going to

182
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,110
experience as we age although the

183
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,259
statistics say that about one in four

184
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,530
adults over the age of 65 will report

185
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:31,209
chronic pain by 2035 and right now it's

186
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:33,610
costing us about five hundred and sixty

187
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,889
billion dollars per year and direct

188
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,528
medical costs lost productivity and

189
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,569
disability we also know it's one of the

190
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:43,778
most common conditions in older adults

191
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,060
65 and up with 40% of them reporting

192
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:48,929
chronic pain it's more common in females

193
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:50,979
and patients over the age of 85

194
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,359
and when people have chronic pain

195
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,800
they're also likely to suffer from

196
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:00,850
depression anxiety insomnia isolation

197
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,829
and falls and here's our current

198
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,629
pharmacological recommendations for

199
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,610
geriatric patients this is our standard

200
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:10,240
of care we start them at acetaminophen

201
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:13,120
or Tylenol and that's usually for low to

202
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,680
moderate pain we have quite a bit of

203
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,509
evidence it's high quality of evidence

204
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,549
to demonstrate that tylenol or

205
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:20,919
acetaminophen is safe and effective for

206
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:23,169
chronic pain although we have to be very

207
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:29,740
concerned about potential liver toxicity

208
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:31,649
in this population then we move into

209
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,879
NSAIDs or your ibuprofen your

210
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,759
anti-inflammatories again these two are

211
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,919
available over-the-counter and we have

212
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,460
quite a bit of evidence high amount of

213
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:44,049
evidence to demonstrate that and seds or

214
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,730
anti-inflammatories can be effective we

215
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:48,339
should only be using them for short term

216
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,649
use though because the long term effects

217
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,480
especially in anybody over the age of 65

218
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:54,879
can be things like decreased kidney

219
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,070
function increased risk of atrial

220
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,399
fibrillation and gastritis or

221
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,810
gastrointestinal side effects I can't

222
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,740
tell you how many patients I have that

223
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:07,599
are using tylenol and ibuprofen just

224
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,220
over the counter without the direction

225
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,430
of a clinician our physician because

226
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,080
they think it's safe if the

227
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:16,120
acetaminophen or NSAIDs are ineffective

228
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,350
we can go to tramadol and when I was

229
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,649
doing my research I found this

230
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:23,529
incredibly interesting that the quality

231
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,720
of evidence to support using tramadol

232
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:29,079
and geriatric patients has not been

233
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:33,129
reported but we're happy to give this to

234
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:37,660
our patients especially because we want

235
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:39,730
to avoid opioids oh I guess my updated

236
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:41,469
slides didn't get in there okay there's

237
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,720
an error on the bottom there you'll

238
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,029
notice we have tricyclic antidepressants

239
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,710
that can be used for neuropathic pain we

240
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,149
also have anticonvulsants like the

241
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,509
gabapentin which can be used for

242
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,309
neuropathic pain and we have low to

243
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:56,080
moderate evidence in those medications

244
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:57,579
but again they seem to be widely

245
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,190
prescribed when I'm meeting with

246
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,720
patients safety considerations in our

247
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,620
anticonvulsant should be peripheral

248
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,980
edema

249
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,440
neuropathy and then of course opioids

250
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,779
right which we're using for moderate to

251
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,530
severe pain but the quality of evidence

252
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:17,559
is low and we have safety considerations

253
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:19,329
you know as tolerance sedation but of

254
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:23,500
course death is the biggest safety

255
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:25,440
consideration and then there's cannabis

256
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,909
which is not currently on our

257
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,190
pharmacological standard of care for

258
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:32,949
geriatric patients or any patient right

259
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:40,660
now at the quality of evidence is high

260
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:41,950
not i GH we have quite a bit of you know

261
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,860
we even know that the National Academy

262
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:47,140
of Sciences recommends cannabis for

263
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,350
chronic pain particularly neuropathic

264
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,480
and spasticity in safety considerations

265
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,340
dizziness sedation potential

266
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,470
hallucinations but we all know we heard

267
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,080
this earlier this is dose dependent we

268
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,330
can control these side effects much

269
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:06,730
easier with cannabis than we can the

270
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:08,530
pharmaceutical options and with opioids

271
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,879
we know that we're now experiencing

272
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,819
we're seeing about a hundred and thirty

273
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,950
deaths per day and when I started to

274
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:18,220
observe in my clinic is that with the

275
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,530
CDC guidelines were changed in 2016 they

276
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,360
changed the practice guidelines because

277
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:25,240
what they noticed in the literature from

278
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,940
2004 and 2009 not the literature when

279
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,840
they looked at overdoses from 2004 to

280
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:34,780
2009 they saw that those as prescribed

281
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:39,070
at 48 and that Mme is morphine milli

282
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:40,929
equivalent dosages between 48 and 98 per

283
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,020
day was where they saw the highest rate

284
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:46,179
of overdoses so the CDC came in and said

285
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,460
let's lower the morphine milli

286
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:51,189
equivalent to 50 milligrams a day and

287
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:54,280
not to exceed 90 unless documentation

288
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,320
supports higher dosages and just to give

289
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,529
you an idea of a morphine equivalent

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,550
that's about 510 milligram hydrocodone a

291
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:05,949
day so what's happened is that

292
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:08,049
clinicians physicians are coming in and

293
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,629
starting to reduce these dosages based

294
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:12,549
on the new CDC guidelines but they're

295
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:15,970
not really offering their patients any

296
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:17,528
alternative right so it's not a surprise

297
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,170
that in states where they have access

298
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:24,458
that patients are looking to cannabis as

299
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:26,528
a potential solution for their pain so

300
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:28,838
as a clinician where do you start if you

301
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:30,970
have a patient who's taking 50

302
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:34,240
milligrams of hydrocodone a day

303
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,009
what's that THC equivalent what we did

304
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,409
is we looked at the literature we know

305
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:40,839
that there's five milligrams of THC can

306
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:43,750
be about as effective as 30 milligrams

307
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,000
of codeine so we went in to an equal

308
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,818
analgesic chart and crunched the numbers

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,938
so that you can get an idea of some of

310
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:53,679
the potential max doses of THC that a

311
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:56,309
patient may need to replace their

312
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,289
opioids depending on how much they're on

313
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:02,078
I'm not aware of any literature that

314
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:04,599
demonstrates CBD as an equal analgesic

315
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:07,359
so usually what I do in my practice is

316
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:14,139
add in CBD to help decrease some of the

317
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:16,500
unwanted effects of THC and cannabis use

318
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:20,980
among seniors has increased tenfold from

319
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,539
2007 to 2017 and I'll often go to other

320
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,639
talks where I hear people tell me that

321
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:26,500
it's a myth that seniors are the

322
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,769
fastest-growing demographic of cannabis

323
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,379
users I disagree most of my patients are

324
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:34,240
75 and older they never used it they

325
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,860
never even smoked a joint in college or

326
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,139
high school so they really are new to

327
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,829
cannabis and they're seeking relief from

328
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:44,259
things like anxiety pain insomnia and

329
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:47,008
there's a lot of barriers for them

330
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:50,800
access a lack of guidance and education

331
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:52,149
the stigma of cannabis I currently have

332
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,448
a patient I've been treating for the

333
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:57,818
last three years who was homebound as a

334
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:59,679
result of her back pain and since

335
00:14:57,818 --> 00:15:01,929
starting cannabis she's now able to

336
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,370
travel again with her husband and get

337
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:06,458
out of the house she got her life back

338
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,159
and she comes and sees me every year for

339
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,599
a checkup and I said Kathy have you told

340
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,250
your adult children yet that you're

341
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,629
using cannabis and she said oh no Eloise

342
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,620
I spent my whole life telling them to

343
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:20,470
say no to drugs

344
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,600
I said Kathy they have to know you're

345
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,209
doing better right aren't they asking

346
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,889
you what's different she said yes and I

347
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:29,129
said what do you tell them she said I

348
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:31,570
tell them I do alternative things

349
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:34,509
that's how deep the stigma is for her

350
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,850
the shame is for her she won't even have

351
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:40,090
these open conversations with her adult

352
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,830
children and of course the cost you know

353
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:45,220
I'm from California we've seen an

354
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:49,180
increase in the price as much as 50

355
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,430
percent for some of these products so

356
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:54,039
what I wanted to do was dive in deeper

357
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:55,809
to the data that I had of course because

358
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,269
it's all handwritten I have to go in

359
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:00,399
manually so I picked 50 female patients

360
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:03,309
who came in and they were suffering from

361
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,649
chronic pain they also had reported

362
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:08,439
anxiety depression or sleep issues and

363
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:11,799
of those 50 patients 33 of them were

364
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,870
cannabis naive the average number of

365
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,969
prescriptions they were on was about 3

366
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,490
when we had one patient who was using it

367
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:22,690
as many as 8 then about 10 patients were

368
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,700
using 5 or more of these 50 patients we

369
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,980
identified 11 of them that had insomnia

370
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:34,629
or sleep related issues either as a

371
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:36,519
primary or secondary diagnosis we also

372
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,889
had 36 patients who had a chronic pain

373
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,289
as a primary secondary diagnosis now

374
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,088
again remember if somebody comes in and

375
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:45,759
sees me for a sleep issue I may identify

376
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:47,140
that their sleep is not they're not

377
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,129
getting quality sleep because they're

378
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:54,069
having pain issues of the 36 patients 16

379
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:55,779
of them had osteoporosis 15 had

380
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,420
neuropathic pain sorry about that

381
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:01,689
boom can you hear me if I step back a

382
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:04,720
little bit okay and about four patients

383
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,338
had other conditions pain conditions 19

384
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,860
of these patients had anxiety or

385
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,809
depression as a primary or secondary

386
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:13,599
diagnosis and the other day a secondary

387
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:17,019
diagnosis included migraines tremors

388
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:22,838
Parkinson's disease Lyme's disease and

389
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:24,639
cancer out of those 50 patients only six

390
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:28,179
patients reported no improvement with

391
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,300
cannabis so 44 out of 50 felt that they

392
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:34,930
got some effects or relief with cannabis

393
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:36,849
thank you five of them used a cannabis

394
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:40,390
tincture and one of them used a cannabis

395
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:42,459
edible of the patients who experienced

396
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,790
improvement this is just a little bit of

397
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,440
a

398
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:46,720
shot of the different types of products

399
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,549
they were using most were using an

400
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,200
account of his tincture a lot of my

401
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:51,669
senior patients prefer that route of

402
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,620
administration it's easy for them to

403
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,070
titrate they have a lot more control

404
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:58,629
over their dose and their experience 3

405
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:01,659
of them used a can of a cannabis

406
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,460
vaporizer only 13 of them had multiple

407
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,870
routes of administration and some of us

408
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,880
who have experienced pain or helped

409
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:09,429
people with pain know that sometimes you

410
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,250
need multiple methods to help control

411
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:14,440
the pain and 9 other had single routes

412
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:20,470
of administration or products like a

413
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:22,090
topical a tablet or a capsule and when

414
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,069
we ask them whether or not a clinician

415
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:25,629
provided treatment plan was effective

416
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:28,809
for treating the primary secondary

417
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:34,510
diagnosis as I said 44 out of 50

418
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:36,429
responded yes we went ahead and looked

419
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:38,259
and see to look at the hours of sleep

420
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,450
that patients reported prior to starting

421
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:43,180
cannabis and on average of 35 patients

422
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,980
is about five and a half hours and after

423
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,250
starting cannabis they were reporting

424
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,720
increased sleep of about 6.5 hours again

425
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,910
where they weren't necessarily coming to

426
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,700
me for sleep but we did notice over all

427
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,769
that sleep improved I think we've heard

428
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,980
that multiple times this last two days

429
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:01,869
as well and before pain their pain score

430
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,640
before cannabis was six point nine and

431
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:09,429
thirty two patients afterwards was three

432
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:10,540
point nine and I really just want to

433
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,310
highlight right now and take an

434
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:14,049
opportunity to highlight the role of the

435
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:15,759
advanced practice nurse and nurses in

436
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,740
general I haven't heard many

437
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,349
conversations about nurses in the last

438
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,430
two days and I want you guys to know or

439
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:26,199
three point nine million strong

440
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:30,700
[Applause]

441
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,980
in North America alone numbers-wise we

442
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,200
outnumber physicians five to one you're

443
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,440
missing an opportunity here in the

444
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,749
industry by not engaging nurses right

445
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,070
and if you look at the data that came

446
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:44,558
out of California for nurse

447
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:47,009
practitioners we actually have lower

448
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,749
rates of preventable hospitalizations

449
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:52,808
readmissions emergency visits when

450
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:54,429
compared to physicians patients are more

451
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:56,288
likely to receive education and

452
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:57,850
counseling from nurse practitioners than

453
00:19:56,288 --> 00:20:00,190
they are from their physicians and were

454
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:04,388
less likely to prescribe opioids for

455
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:06,190
pain so we're ready we're ready we have

456
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:10,148
the American cannabis Nurses Association

457
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:12,489
and the incoming president the 1,300

458
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:15,488
members and 48 states and our mission is

459
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:17,558
to educate collaborate and advocate so I

460
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:19,058
encourage you all to know that we are an

461
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:23,200
ally we're looking for strategic

462
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:27,819
partnerships because it takes a lot of

463
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,379
us to get together and collaborate and

464
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,759
when I look at the research that I have

465
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:32,769
right now in the ways that I want to

466
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,858
improve here are some implications for

467
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:37,989
research that I would like to see now

468
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:40,118
how do we engage patients to maintain

469
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:41,919
follow-up appointments to help them

470
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,730
eliminate pain medications and achieve

471
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,700
success

472
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,108
for me the biggest barrier is cost they

473
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,659
have to pay out of pocket for my

474
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:52,658
appointment and the cost of medicine and

475
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:54,340
then any follow-up appointments they

476
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:56,679
struggle with the cost of the

477
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:58,449
medications the fact that insurance

478
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,809
doesn't cover it they can get their

479
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,639
gabapentin sometimes for 50 cents for a

480
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:06,788
month's supply right how do we compete

481
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:09,579
with that when a tincture can be $70

482
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:12,608
before regulatory taxes that may last

483
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:14,378
them a couple weeks and can we measure

484
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:16,118
success rates when patients are working

485
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:19,178
with clinicians directly versus going

486
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:20,980
into a dispensary first what I have

487
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:23,139
found when I would do speak with people

488
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,480
in the industry particularly producers

489
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:27,189
or dispensaries they often tell me that

490
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,220
they're spending anywhere from 30 to 60

491
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,769
minutes in a new Senior patient who may

492
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,778
be coming to them about cannabis so

493
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:37,989
again we have this opportunity here to

494
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:38,779
engage with clinicians help reduce that

495
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:40,340
amount of time

496
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:42,769
that maybe some of the staff is spending

497
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:44,659
answering questions for their patients

498
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:46,670
and get them on the right track right

499
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,250
away because if we can find their

500
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:52,130
medicine they have to take it daily

501
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,710
sometimes multiple times today so this

502
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:59,240
is where we want to be focusing on is

503
00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:00,620
medicine for these patients okay I

504
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,950
actually have a little bit of time for

505
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,299
questions um I think I have about eight

506
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,200
minutes if anybody hasn't yeah I don't

507
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:15,349
know if there's a mic there's a

508
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:17,090
microphone in the middle and if anybody

509
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:18,889
has questions about the data our data

510
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:21,319
scientist is here because I don't speak

511
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,600
that language I was wondering when

512
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:25,789
you're to expand a little bit further on

513
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,859
engaging nurse practitioners and

514
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:31,129
obviously possibly educating nurse

515
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:33,189
practitioners so Illinois is just coming

516
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,780
on to be you know adult use recreational

517
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,900
so I'm not really sure if there are any

518
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:41,809
networks that are already established in

519
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,500
Illinois and if not what would or what

520
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:47,629
or how would you do would you say to

521
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,000
create this type of a network yes so we

522
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,590
do have the American cannabis Nurses

523
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,180
Association we do have members in

524
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:55,339
Illinois and actually a couple of them

525
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,140
are nurse practitioners so by joining

526
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:59,569
the organization you do get that network

527
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,130
I'm in that opportunity to see what

528
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:02,779
they're doing and there's lots of

529
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,700
educational opportunities I can talk

530
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:06,859
about offline with you so that you can

531
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,480
you know start to get thank you yeah I

532
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:10,579
just got a quick one I'm dr. Gillian

533
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,370
Smith a pain physician where did you get

534
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:15,349
the slide about the Oh me cannabis

535
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:18,889
conversion like how did you come to that

536
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:26,269
which one were you talking about the

537
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:31,850
Ami's and then the cannabis my charts

538
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:35,119
yes oh oh we did that we what we did is

539
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:38,149
we looked at the the we took the data

540
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,609
from five milligrams of THC can be equal

541
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,019
to 30 milligrams of codeine and then we

542
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:44,299
went in and looked at at a standard

543
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:46,039
equal analgesic chart with codeine and

544
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:48,919
hydromorphone and oxycodone and

545
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:51,859
hydrocodone and we did the math where

546
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,759
did you get that five to thirty I can

547
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:53,990
give you the reference

548
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:56,420
I don't have it off the top of my head

549
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,220
but yeah it's there's some literature

550
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,060
out there okay the five milligrams yeah

551
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,250
that'd be great thank you

552
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:14,720
yeah you're welcome this is what you're

553
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:17,029
talking about right okay yeah I was up

554
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,740
there wasn't it oh it's on my screen I'm

555
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:20,829
sorry I'm like what are you guys talking

556
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,829
about

557
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:29,629
okay thank you so much i pyrius if you

558
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:31,190
could give some clinical tips and pearls

559
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,690
of how do you start the process with the

560
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,250
older adult mm-hmm

561
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,019
that's a great question I'm fortunate

562
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,230
enough to have 45 minutes with each new

563
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:40,490
patient and really I have them fill out

564
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,349
a pretty thorough health history

565
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,480
beforehand and when they come and I want

566
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:45,649
to know their goals because I may look

567
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,269
at their thing and think oh they're

568
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,670
coming here for pain right but they're

569
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:50,569
really coming here for sleep and of

570
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,960
course low-and-slow

571
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:55,339
the education helps them to feel less

572
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,019
anxious about it because they have a lot

573
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:59,329
of misconceptions and I usually ask them

574
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:00,740
not to what are your misconception or

575
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:02,210
what are your what brought you to

576
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,829
cannabis are you concerned about

577
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:08,569
anything you know you hear that euphoria

578
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:10,699
and I loved how dr. Sulak addressed it

579
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:13,519
today because often I'll say it apace

580
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:16,340
you wait to feel better more relaxed

581
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,859
more communicative with your spouse you

582
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:20,480
know and they're like well yeah I'm like

583
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:23,569
well that's the euphoria from cannabis

584
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,000
right so they start to come around with

585
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:31,309
education and they get less scared about

586
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,859
proceeding so I'm a physician in

587
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:35,960
Maryland and I work with a nurse

588
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:38,599
practitioner thank you

589
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:43,039
and I'm a big fan of nurse practitioners

590
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:46,309
yeah so don't don't everybody go

591
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,059
crapping on doctors no no it's

592
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,980
collaborative

593
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:53,619
we need not all cut from the same cloth

594
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:57,559
you know one comment and then a question

595
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:59,809
my comment is that I have a similar

596
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,230
practice cohort to you a lot of elderly

597
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:06,139
patients all fearful of getting stoned

598
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:08,059
and my main concern in them is on

599
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,900
unsteadiness on their feet and fallings

600
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:16,669
I'm very cautious about dosing my

601
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:21,650
question is why have I forgotten my

602
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:24,230
question it's not cannabis related it's

603
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,660
not that I'll check with you offline

604
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,809
it's like being gone sorry yeah and just

605
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:33,230
so you know that they don't call it dope

606
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:35,089
for nothing the average dose that most

607
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,849
of my patients are taking is about 2.5

608
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:40,849
to 10 milligrams of cannabinoids so it's

609
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:44,149
pretty low and I support the concerns

610
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:46,939
about falling yeah okay great yes I my

611
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:49,009
name's Thank You Eloise my name is John

612
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,840
Calvert I've had the privilege of being

613
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,700
in the cannabis industry going on nine

614
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:53,990
years right now and I've also had the

615
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,250
privilege for almost two years and

616
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,880
working with this wonderful lady up here

617
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:00,650

618
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,120
is this and first a statement everyone

619
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,280
that's in this room and everyone has had

620
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:06,289
the privilege of listening to Raphael

621
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,049
and Sulak and all these wonderful

622
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:12,079
speakers here the baseline is education

623
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:14,000
and the challenge is that I have is my

624
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,059
business and our company is really

625
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,650
getting the word out there and so Eloise

626
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:19,009
is all about education it's her middle

627
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:24,230
name

628
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:27,859
it's your initial article yes so and it

629
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:29,269
takes dedication beyond that anything

630
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:31,759
yeah you're shaking your head you damn

631
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:34,579
well bet it takes education but it takes

632
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,559
a commitment you sign on for a first

633
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:38,329
some sort of a seminar it's over in an

634
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,519
hour but you sign on to take a webinar

635
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:42,889
series that lasts four hours it takes

636
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:45,079
tremendous dedication so elbow using

637
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,900
your experience past experience and

638
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:50,869
going forward can you list what you

639
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,720
think are the top three mechanisms the

640
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:55,009
ways that were waving the magic wand

641
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,700
whatever it is what do you think the

642
00:27:55,009 --> 00:28:02,359
baseline and how to get the message out

643
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:04,880
thank you oh great that's like a huge

644
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:08,199
question John you could have sent it to

645
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,580
me ahead of time to sound intelligent I

646
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,350
think it's about collaboration and

647
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:13,399
coming together and I hope that I didn't

648
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:15,049
come across like we don't need

649
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,600
physicians okay good because I'm very

650
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:18,819
aware of that and sense

651
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,279
I think we need all all of us together

652
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:23,319
whether it's the the growers the bud

653
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,389
tenders the manufacturers the clinicians

654
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:28,240
we are all here to help patients and we

655
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:29,800
have to really continue to plant those

656
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,660
seeds because not everybody's ready

657
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:32,889
right and then we come back and water it

658
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,650
a little bit and then we come back and

659
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:38,770
water it and eventually the results are

660
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:40,180
going to speak for themselves and people

661
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:45,639
will naturally like we're seeing now

662
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:46,990
gravitate towards it oh well we'll take

663
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:58,960
off mine because we have nice people in

664
00:28:46,990 --> 00:29:00,069
line two seconds mm-hmm yeah yeah yes of

665
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,870
course I think it's money well spent we

666
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:05,039
can talk about it offline too and and

667
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:07,809
you can see that I don't know if I'm

668
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,839
managing this well sorry how about we go

669
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:13,990
here hi hi thank you so much for working

670
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:16,240
with older people yeah thank you um my

671
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,910
question is about cannabis and how it

672
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,220
might help dementia hmm

673
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,230
in our experience cannabis really helps

674
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,450
dementia but I'm not a doctor I'm just

675
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,430
the family caregiver turned advocate can

676
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,319
you tell us your experience working with

677
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,180
dementia yeah well the role that you

678
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:33,759
have is really important so don't say

679
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,710
just Thanks yeah I mean because dementia

680
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,019
is a very challenging disease as you

681
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,190
know and it's another presentation I

682
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:41,230
could do I'm really fortunate in

683
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,870
California to work with assisted living

684
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:46,059
communities that will dispense cannabis

685
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:47,859
under a written order by the physician

686
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:50,319
and myself I'd like to get a list of

687
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:52,179
those people yeah so I have about three

688
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,089
dozen patients right now who are using

689
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:58,539
cannabis for their agitation anxiety and

690
00:29:55,089 --> 00:30:01,419
it's dramatic the results that we see is

691
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:04,990
it a large dose or small dose not two

692
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:07,870
milligrams of THC for most yeah not CBD

693
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,430
a few times a day it depends but yeah

694
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:11,049
