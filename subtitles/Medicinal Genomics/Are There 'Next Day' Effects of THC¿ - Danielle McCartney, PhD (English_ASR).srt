2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:15,178
all right

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,740
so

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,460
um let's let's talk about the result

5
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:22,979
results of your research so how many

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,900
different studies were you able to to

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,118
look at and what were sort of the the

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,059
main takeaways there

9
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,859
yeah so as you said our review looked at

10
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,019
the what we consider to be next day

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,559
effects of THC so basically we were

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,960
looking to identify any Interventional

13
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,899
studies so studies where either cannabis

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,539
or THC had been administered in some

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,120
form and their participants have been

16
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,579
required to undertake or perform some

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,799
kind of either simulated safety

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,079
sensitive task for things like driving

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:58,078
or are there some studies on simulated

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,079
airplane flying or some more sort of

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,399
standard and sort of common I guess

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,859
computerized cognitive tasks and there's

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,079
a wide variety of of those sorts of

24
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,000
activities and so to be included in the

25
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,759
review the studies had to have done this

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,438
and measured performance at least eight

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,140
hours following cannabis use because

28
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,579
that's sort of what we consider to be

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,299
um I guess your typical overnight

30
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:23,579
recovery period And so studies most of

31
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,979
them administered the tasks between sort

32
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,798
of 8 and 12 hours following cannabis use

33
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,179
and and some administered all the way

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,040
through

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,479
often they conducted testing at multiple

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,700
time points they might have measured at

37
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:39,420
12 hours and then 24 hours and sometimes

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,299
all the way up to 48 hours so we found a

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,400
total of 20 studies that had done this a

40
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,780
little published quite some time ago

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,740
there was a little bit of recent work

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,478
but largely historical and they measured

43
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,000
quite a number of different outcomes I

44
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,679
think it was several hundred uh

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,719
different sort of organists sorry

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,340
several hundred different tasks and

47
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,978
that's across all the studies at all the

48
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,540
different time points and um under all

49
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,159
the different cannabis conditions so

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,680
often the studies would administer one

51
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,560
dose of THC on one study and and a

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,620
different dose on or sorry one dose of

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,539
DHC on one arm of one study and a

54
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,159
different dose and a different arm in

55
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:19,079
the same study so you end up with like

56
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,299
you know the amount of data sort of just

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,620
increases exponentially as you start to

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,620
include these different arms and

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,980
different time points so yeah it turned

60
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,239
out to be a reasonably large undertaking

61
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:32,459
um but yeah

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,659
what we included in our review

63
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:39,300
okay and what were the results are were

64
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:42,539
you finding that people were impaired

65
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,879
after eight hours or or no

66
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:48,179
um so the vast majority of studies

67
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,518
showed no next day effects of THC so

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,480
that was across a variety of different

69
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,580
cognitive tasks and safety sensitive and

70
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,280
safety sensitive sorry simulated safety

71
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,319
sensitive tasks there were a small

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,598
number of studies that detected next day

73
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,759
effects but I guess an important element

74
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,280
of this review is not just to look at

75
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,340
quantity although there were overming

76
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,620
majority showing no next AFX but also to

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,598
look at the quality of the studies and

78
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,459
what they're sort of showing and when we

79
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,979
looked closely at this sort of small

80
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,878
number of studies showing subtle next

81
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,560
day effects they tended to be not such

82
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,899
good quality so

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,759
um none of them were randomized

84
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,280
controlled trials for example which is

85
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,979
our most rigorous form of Interventional

86
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,158
study and they often

87
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,719
um and they didn't tend to have the

88
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,519
um employ the best sort of

89
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,080
standardization procedures so what I

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,658
mean by that is we're really interested

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,959
in making sure that the studies we

92
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:50,699
um were sort of reading into used

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,739
um but didn't allow their participants

94
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,259
to sort of consume alcohol 24 hours

95
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,299
prior to you know undertaking tasks

96
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,919
caffeine stay up all night all of those

97
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,900
things that can go on to affect

98
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,818
cognitive function we wanted to be sure

99
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,860
that they had been controlled out of the

100
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,899
sort of context so

101
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,519
um basically the gist is the studies

102
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,620
that did show next day effects which

103
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,620
there were very few of

104
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,319
um tended not to be great quality

105
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,418
um whilst there was a couple among those

106
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,060
showing sort of no next day effects that

107
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:24,918
were quite good quality so that seems to

108
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,918
be whether the evidence is at the moment

109
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,220
