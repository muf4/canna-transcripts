66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
decades

67
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,359
investigating how both recreational and

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,719
medical cannabis use

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
affects the brain in 2014 dr gruber

70
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,080
launched

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
mind which stands for marijuana

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
investigations

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,319
for neuroscientific discovery the first

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,280
ever program of its kind designed

75
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:48,238
to clarify the specific effects of

76
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,640
medical cannabis use

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,959
what she and her team have found is that

78
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,439
not only do medical cannabis patients

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,159
tend to perform better on cognitive

80
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,560
tests

81
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,318
when compared to recreational users but

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,000
medical cannabis patients tend to

83
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,839
outperform themselves

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,080
when compared to tests administered

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,560
before they started treatment

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,239
stacy and i explore why this may be the

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,479
case in our conversation

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,200
and we also discuss some results from

89
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,238
mind's double-blind placebo-controlled

90
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,919
cbd clinical trial for anxiety which

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,120
uses a high cbd

92
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,439
whole plant extract spoiler alert

93
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,080
the cognitive performance data is pretty

94
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,000
consistent with the team's earlier work

95
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
other interesting observations from the

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
study include

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,440
patients using whole plant extract tend

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,239
to use smaller doses

99
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,959
than single compound therapeutics as you

100
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,959
would expect

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,479
this led us to discuss the entourage

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,759
effect and the benefits

103
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,000
of using full spectrum products however

104
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,959
it was interesting that some patients in

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,158
the trial

106
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,319
still tested positive for thc despite

107
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,039
the fact that the hemp derived extract

108
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,238
contained

109
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:01,039
less than 0.3 milligrams per ml

110
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
of thc lots of good stuff in this

111
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,919
conversation

112
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280

only for joining us on the podcast but

156
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,879
for being a

157
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,199
two-time canmed presenter

158
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,879
i know that in 2019 we were thrilled to

159
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,560
have you as a keynote presenter where

160
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,959
you shared the data that you

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,879
and your team have collected about how

162
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,359
cannabis affects cognitive function

163
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,240
which

164
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,120
is quite extensive but for lister

165
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,038
listeners who

166
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
might not be too familiar with you or

167
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,079
the work that your team is doing

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,600
i was thinking that a great place to

169
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,719
start would be for you to

170
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,439
fill them in on the work that you've

171

been doing sure well first of all i'm a

172
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,719
huge fan of canned med let's start with

173
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,360
that and um i actually think i've been

174
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680
three times

175
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
extraordinary conference and it really

176
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
is

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
um probably the the very best of its

178
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
kind that's out there and i

179
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,599
am very fond of telling people that so

180
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,680
there you have it um

181
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,639
but just by way of i think a little bit

182
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
of background

183
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,639
i've spent decades actually looking at

184
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,839
the impact of

185
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,240
recreational cannabis use on things like

186
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,159
cognitive performance clinical state

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,879
measures of brain structure and function

188
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,880
etc

189
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,918
with a particular focus on what we call

190
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,839
the vulnerable brain

191
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,079
so what happens to individuals who may

192
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,638
begin using cannabis very regularly

193
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,519
while their brain is still developing or

194
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,720
as i like to call it half-baked

195
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,240
those studies from our lab and from

196
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,440
colleagues across the country and really

197
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,199
in fact the globe

198
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,879
demonstrate that there appear to be some

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,598
differences in those who begin using

200
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,240
cannabis

201
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,680
regularly especially with regard to

202
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,439
again some of these cognitive

203
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
measures especially those mediated by

204
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,719
the frontal part of the brain

205
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,000
now that's the recreational story and it

206
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
seems to hold

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,639
for again early onset regular cannabis

208
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,280
users and there's a relationship between

209
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,478
earlier onset higher magnitude that is

210
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,598
higher amount of views and higher

211
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,199
frequency of use

212
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,199
and maybe not doing quite as well on

213
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,759
some of these measures as other folks

214
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,759
who use

215
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
uh regularly starting later when their

216
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,598
brains are more fully developed

217
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,520
or who start you know when they're when

218
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:46,079
they're you know in their 40s or later

219
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,359
that's the recreational story uh that we

220
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,918
that we've spent a lot of time looking

221
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,598
at

222
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,598
but i was very surprised when i looked

223
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,360
in the literature since medical cannabis

224
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,478
was first legalized in the states in

225
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,720
1996

226
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,680
i couldn't find much with regard to the

227
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
impact of

228
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,598
medical cannabis use and the potential

229
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,878
impact of that

230
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,560
type of of cannabis use on measures of

231
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
again cognitive performance clinical

232
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,879
state quality of life sleep

233
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,719
conventional medication use again

234
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,039
despite the fact that it's been around

235
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,639
uh for a long time so we started a

236
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,079
program called mind

237
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,000
marijuana investigations for

238
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,038
neuroscientific discovery it really

239
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,120
should have cannabis in the name

240
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,038
but states have medical marijuana laws

241
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
so we stuck with mind and that program

242
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,159
is really

243
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,320
dedicated specifically to looking at the

244
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
potential impact of medical cannabis use

245
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,519
on all of those domains i mentioned

246
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,560
and others using lots of different

247
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,839
approaches so longitudinal observational

248
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,679
data which was the first

249
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,600
set of studies that we launched

250
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,359
survey-based data

251
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,800
and finally clinical trial data which

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,440
i'm very very excited about

253
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,439
excellent and in doing my research for

254
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,120
this conversation it seemed like in

255
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,680
you touched on it in your in your great

256
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,519
summary that

257
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,120
the the studies that you've done can be

258
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
sort of broken into a few different

259
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,560
broad groups

260
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,399
one first as you mentioned depending on

261
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,559
user type the recreational

262
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,159
versus the medical and then age

263
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,679
adolescent versus adult

264
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,679
and then i'm curious too um

265
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,278
does some of those findings have to do

266
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,919
with the type of product being used

267
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,600
whether it be

268
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:26,000
kind of high cbd versus high thc

269
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,440
yeah those are those are great um great

270
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,879
points and you know the very first thing

271
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,320
i always like to remind people of

272
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,320
because you know

273
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,240
first of all cannabis is a highly

274
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
polarizing topic right

275
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,000
i've never actually dealt with anything

276
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,879
in psychiatry or neuroscience that's

277
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,919
quite as

278
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,519
um as much of a hot topic as

279
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,439
cannabis and maybe a hot potato people

280
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,240
have very strong feelings on both sides

281
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
you know

282
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,759
either it's you know the the devil's

283
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,360
weed the devil's lattice and and it

284
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,759
should be outlawed immediately if not

285
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,759
sooner or

286
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,720
cannabis later al the plant that is the

287
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,560
you know the the plant

288
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,959
from which everything comes and then we

289
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,639
have things that are single extracted

290
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,639
constituents of the plant right the main

291
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,319
players delta nine thc the my

292
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,559
main psychoactive or intoxicating

293
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,640
constituent and as you appropriately

294
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,879
note cannabidiol or cbd

295
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,240
a primary non-intoxicating constituent

296
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,120
but there are lots and lots of other

297
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,959
cannabinoids

298
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,039
phytocannabinoids things from the plant

299
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,958
that interact with our own system of

300
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,319
um chemicals and receptors the

301
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,000
endocannabinoid system

302
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,680
there are terpenoids the essential oils

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,278
that give cannabis its characteristic

304
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,838
scent and flavor profile that have their

305
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,240
own

306
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,200
biobehavioral effects flavonoids waxy

307
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,278
fields you name it

308
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,360
lots of different things cannabis is not

309
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,240
one thing whole plant full spectrum

310
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,639
products

311
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,000
very different from single extracted

312
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,120
purified compounds

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,519
something like an epidiolex purified cbd

314
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,399
likely very different from a non-plant

315
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,360
derived that is

316
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
i made it in the lab synthetic thc

317
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,360
something like

318
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,200
um marinol all of these things are

319
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,560
likely to convert different effects but

320
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
i thought one thing that you mentioned

321
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,399
was incredibly important and i spent a

322
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,799
lot of time reminding people

323
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,679
recreational or adult cannabis use is

324
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,078
very different

325
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,799
from medical cannabis use when you look

326
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,838
at the

327
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,078
cohorts that is the population and

328
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,760
that's because their goals are different

329
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,759
the recreational consumers typically

330
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,039
looking to change their current state of

331
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,639
being or to get high

332
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,958
and thus they look for products high in

333
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,399
thc that primary psychoactive

334
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,639
constituent

335
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,078
our medical patients almost always say

336
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,919
dr gruber i don't

337
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,120
want to get high i just want to be able

338
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,958
to drive my car

339
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
i just want to be able to sleep through

340
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,799
the night and as a result

341
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,278
our medical patients often choose

342
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,879
products with a broader cannabinoid

343
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,200
constituent profile

344
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,600
that is often dominated by

345
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
non-intoxicating constituents like cbt

346
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,159
so when we look at the data

347
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,078
that come from our studies of

348
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,759
recreational consumers or adult

349
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,719
consumers of cannabis

350
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,360
versus medical consumers or medical

351
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,519
patients

352
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,639
the data does look different and very

353
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,839
likely because

354
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,159
the goals of use tend to drive product

355
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,160
selection

356
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,600
yeah and that is as you said a very

357
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,039
important distinction but

358
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,000
and i'm curious is there sort of a

359
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,799
third type of user in there that maybe

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,600
isn't

361
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,799
interested in the recreational high and

362
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
maybe doesn't have

363
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,399
a you know a severe condition that

364
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
really needs

365
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,159
medical use but maybe is interested in

366
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,278
using cannabis just for a

367
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,120
general wellness supplement sure

368
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,759
that's a great point and actually i'm a

369
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
firm believer in

370
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,278
exactly that kind of approach i think a

371
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,159
lot of people when they begin to

372
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,958
understand

373
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,919
the potential of exploiting the

374
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,799
non-intoxicating constituents from the

375
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,719
plant

376
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,719
given the potential health benefits they

377
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
may confer they look to use it as

378
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,879
prophylaxis or health and wellness as

379
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,040
opposed to

380
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,639
treating a symptom or condition or

381
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,360
looking to get high to your point i

382
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,879
think

383
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,560
a lot of products that are currently on

384
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,838
the market that are classified as hemp

385
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,239
derived meaning they come from a

386
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,959
cultivar with less than 0.3

387
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,839
thc by weight that's exactly what people

388
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,919
are using it for

389
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,120
um and they've they've decided that this

390
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,078
is a uh

391
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,039
likely a very helpful and not likely

392
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,159
very harmful

393
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,480
thing to add to their daily regimen and

394
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,919
so i'm curious in terms of

395
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,440
looking at cognitive effects is there a

396
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,399
difference there have you been able to

397
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,800
look into that

398
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,799
i know that you you've mentioned that

399
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,278
folks who use cannabis for a medicinal

400
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,278
purpose

401
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,600
actually perform better on a lot of the

402
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,879
the measures that you've been looking at

403
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,320
is there any and you look into those who

404
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,000
are kind of using it

405
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,160
as a supplement or general wellness do

406
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
they perform worse better stay the same

407
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,759
it's a great question you know so far we

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,759
really have data from what i would call

409
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,720
the two primary cohorts but again your

410
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,958
point is a good one

411
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
that that third cohort um is an

412
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,479
important one to think about

413
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,079
recreational consumers we know with

414
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,000
earlier onset and higher frequency

415
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,159
and magnitude of use we tend to see some

416
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,078
difficulties with tasks

417
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,439
that are controlled or mediated by that

418
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,239
frontal part of the brain which

419
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,279
not coincidentally is the last uh part

420
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,120
of the brain to become

421
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,720
fully developed or to come online so

422
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
that's not surprising right so if you

423
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
begin to use anything

424
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,279
whether it's cannabis or other

425
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,599
substances alcohol

426
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,198
or if you're injured or you're ill very

427
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
possibly you may sustain

428
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,958
uh some damage or or have some issues

429
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,399
completing tasks

430
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:35,198
required or which require the part of

431
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,600
the brain that's not yet fully developed

432
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:40,479
the medical cannabis patient story is

433
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,040
very different and we have published

434
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,959
some really interesting data on rather

435
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,799
small samples but compelling

436
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,159
samples of well-characterized medical

437
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,958
patients demonstrating

438
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,240
that at baseline where they have no

439
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,000
cannabis on board

440
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,399
and then you know after being tested at

441
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
3 months 6 12 18 and 24

442
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,320
we generally not only don't see

443
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,159
decrements in performance specifically

444
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,079
on those same types of tasks

445
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,519
that the recreational consumers show

446
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:06,559
some difficulty with if they're early

447
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,240
onset users

448
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,159
they actually do show some improvement

449
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,959
which is really quite stunning i don't

450
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,000
think people

451
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:16,239
necessarily expected that

452
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,278
so those negative effects that that

453
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,759
affect the

454
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,480
recreational users is that sort of an

455
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,919
acute

456
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
sort of effect is that something that

457
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,439
can be overcome if you

458
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,879
stop use or is that sort of a lasting

459
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,600
effect that can

460
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,799
continue great question um you know

461
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
there have been studies

462
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,000
um longitudinal studies that actually

463
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,159
follow folks over time

464
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,559
and they try to identify individuals who

465
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,000
begin using it early

466
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,758
versus those who began using later and

467
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,320
then you see how things sort of quote

468
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,440
turn out

469
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,040
long term and what happens after a

470
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
protracted period of absence

471
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,078
lots of studies look at absence periods

472
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,519
that are um

473
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,120
several days to several weeks but the

474
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,078
bigger question is really what happens

475
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,519
if you stop using

476
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,599
and how do you look compared to where

477
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,600
you where you were when you

478
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,440
when you were using you know i think

479
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,199
that there is a fair amount of evidence

480
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,079
suggesting that for individuals who are

481
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,359
using

482
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,919
um with great frequency and at high

483
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,600
amounts who happen to be young

484
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,519
when they take a break or cut down they

485
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,959
do tend to look a little bit different

486
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,039
so it's not as if there's this quote

487
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,000
long-term damage and again damage is a

488
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,000
relative term

489
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,679
it's not as if we're seeing you know

490
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,879
data that suggests these people can't do

491
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,799
anything

492
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,240
and i want to make that very clear it's

493
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,000
uh you know in our studies

494
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,399
when we look at people who are using

495
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,839
very very high amounts of cannabis

496
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,519
very frequently it's not as if these

497
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,279
people can't perform or can't function

498
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,799
it's that on specific tests we really

499
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,600
did see some differences in those folks

500
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,599
versus those

501
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,278
who began using much later on who didn't

502
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,320
use at all

503
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,078
i think a number of studies have

504
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,800
demonstrated that performance does

505
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,719
improve

506
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,879
with protracted periods of abstinence or

507
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,879
reduction in the amount of use

508
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:54,159
again primarily in those folks who are

509
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,159
using early on

510
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,879
so you mentioned when we were sort of

511
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,879
talking about the difference between

512
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,558
adolescents and adults i'm curious

513
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,000
in adolescents who are looking to use

514
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,959
cannabis to treat

515
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,759
conditions like anxiety or depression or

516
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,919
anything

517
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,759
like that are there considerations that

518
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,079
need to be taken for

519
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,000
for them i think absolutely i think for

520
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,000
anybody but especially for those who

521
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,199
i consider our most vulnerable consumers

522
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,439
those are the folks who are

523
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,839
in their their adolescent or emerging

524
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,480
adults again the brain is quote

525
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,918
um again under construction half baked

526
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,400
whatever euphemism you want to use

527
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,600
um not quite done and we always tell

528
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,360
people we're not saying

529
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,119
just say no we're saying just not yet

530
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:38,959
and for those folks it's especially

531
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,038
important to remember that

532
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,798
delta 9 thc again the primary

533
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,400
constituent appears to be

534
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:49,519
appears to be what confers the greatest

535
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
um potential declarant later on so we

536
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,160
don't have much

537
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,759
in the way of data suggesting that

538
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,400
exposure to other

539
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,679
cannabinoid constituents like cbd cause

540
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,840
problems later so for folks with anxiety

541
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,280
or difficulty with with things related

542
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,319
to anxiety or perhaps

543
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:09,119
some other conditions products high in

544
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:12,879
cbd with very low or perhaps even

545
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:15,839
no thc may be may be a consideration

546
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,760
versus products with discernible and uh

547
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,720
sometimes not so insignificant amounts

548
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,319
of thc

549
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,759
for people with anxiety it's also

550
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,079
important to remember we have a whole

551
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,480
set of studies dedicated

552
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,639
to looking at patients with moderate to

553
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,360
severe anxiety it's important to

554
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,880
remember that thc appears to have

555
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,359
um a very interesting impact on

556
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
symptoms related to anxiety at low doses

557
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,079
thc

558
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,720
may be anxiolytic that is it may relieve

559
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,678
anxiety ah it took the edge off

560
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,798
i'm chilling i said okay at low doses at

561
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,840
high doses

562
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,558
thc can exacerbate or increase

563
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,798
anxiety or be what we call anxiogenic

564
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,240
that is make anxiety significantly worse

565
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,839
or create anxiety

566
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,160
so it's a very important thing to be

567
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,720
mindful of especially in a day

568
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,679
where we are i mean bombarded with

569
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,120
products

570
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,120
but you know the concentrate market

571
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,519
starts life at about 35 40

572
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,279
thc and goes from there and for some

573
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,359
folks that's absolutely okay

574
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,440
i'm sure for people and patients with

575
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,959
anxiety that can be a real problem so

576
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,600
it's important to know quote what's in

577
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,759
your weed

578
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,759
which is why we conduct laboratory

579
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,279
analyses of all of our patients

580
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:28,879
um most commonly used products

581
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,798
interesting and so what are

582
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,880
what compounds are you looking for when

583
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,798
you when you test it are you looking at

584
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,880
uh terpenes and flavonoids and

585
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,319
stillbinoids the more i talk to people

586
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,760
about all the different compounds that

587
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,159
are in the plant it's

588
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,319
staggering amazing yeah it's an

589
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,320
extremely complex plant and so

590
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,678
incredibly fascinating as far as i'm i'm

591
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,000
concerned no um

592
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,160
you know for our study subjects given

593
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,798
the extraordinary cost of these

594
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,840
analyses but the absolute need for us to

595
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,679
know because

596
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,678
the observational longitudinal study

597
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,759
which again follows

598
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,360
real world folks using real world

599
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,640
products i'm not actually creating a

600
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,439
product in those studies

601
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,320
we're just following patients um and

602
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
allowing them to use

603
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,158
whatever products they choose but then

604
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,798
we want to know what's in the product

605
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,440
because

606
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,038
as you have probably also heard very

607
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,880
often what's on the label does not

608
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,079
reflect what's actually in the product

609
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,159
and that's a problem so we're really um

610
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,599
having uh cannabinoid constituent

611
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,320
profiling done so

612
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,599
13 cannabinoids are quantified for our

613
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,599
clinical trial data

614
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,839
um you know before we ever get to the

615
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,399
state where we're administering anything

616
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,959
everything is profiled and analyzed

617
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,320
including

618
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,919
you know the terpenoid profile because

619
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,038
if we're aiming for a specific profile

620
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,640
we want to make sure

621
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,400
we've hit it but you know i think the

622
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,240
patients find it incredibly helpful

623
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,320
especially those who are spending lots

624
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,359
of money on products that purport to

625
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,839
have let's say

626
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,479
30 mins per ml of cbd right an online

627
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
product

628
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,319
hemp derived so it's legal they buy it

629
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,080
it can be shipped to them at home

630
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,599
um and they wonder why they don't notice

631
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,599
anything and then we

632
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,959
we tested for them and they find out

633
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,558
they don't feel anything because it's

634
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,159
got less than one meg per ml or

635
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,119
something like that

636
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,440
that's that's terrible yeah that's going

637
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,359
to be

638
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,798
incredibly frustrating for patients and

639
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,479
probably even equally

640
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,158
frustrating for you as a researcher to

641
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,360
not have a consistent

642
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,640
product to be able to kind of limit

643
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,240
those variables

644
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,000
absolutely i mean there are some

645
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
products that continue

646
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,159
and can they continue and consistently

647
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
test

648
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,600
exactly where they should and that's

649
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,119
great in terms of some of these

650
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,879
manufacturers that's terrific

651
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,678
unfortunately not all are created

652
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,600
equally

653
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,519
um and for these studies where we are

654
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,639
relying on patients to use the products

655
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,158
that they select

656
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,840
we want them to be getting you know what

657
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,200
they are supposed to be getting for the

658
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,279
clinical trials of course we have

659
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,720
a lot more control over it but by and

660
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,480
large i think it's a really helpful

661
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
piece of information and a very valuable

662
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,839
tool for

663
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,879
our patients to to be able to see oh

664
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,720
this is not exactly what i'm arguing for

665
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,320
okay let's talk let's talk about the

666
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,000
clinical trial

667
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,000
we're fortunate enough to have received

668
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,079
several inds or investigational new drug

669
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,200
approvals for a number of indications

670
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,960
including um anxiety and pain but

671
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,200
starting first with anxiety

672
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,319
we actually had the very first ever

673
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,840
study of whole plant

674
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,639
full spectrum high cbd low thc but not

675
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,959
no thc

676
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,559
sublingual solution that was formulated

677
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,640
for patients

678
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,038
with moderate to severe anxiety and

679
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,640
that's an open labeled double-blind

680
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,640
placebo-controlled trial we intended the

681
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,000
open label phase to also be a little bit

682
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,200
of a dose-finding study because look

683
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,558
this has never been done

684
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,240
and we know in studies that use

685
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,519
single-extracted compounds

686
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,440
like epidiolex um you know the doses

687
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,400
that are being used are incredibly high

688
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,480
that's also true of non-plant derived

689
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,440
cannabidiol sources that have been used

690
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,038
in studies of

691
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,038
for example things like social anxiety

692
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,960
disorder so the question is you know

693
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:58,000
using the whole platform spectrum

694
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,400
product would we need the same

695
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,200
kind of dose and anecdotally we hear

696
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,200
that people

697
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
experience tremendous relief using some

698
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,798
products that they get online

699
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,320
at significantly lower doses so we

700
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,798
pitched it that way

701
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,599
and the open label phase was designed to

702
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:13,918
look at 15

703
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,199
folks who received the study product

704
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,799
that i formulated

705
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,640
and they take it three times a day it's

706
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:19,359
a sublingual solution so they take one

707
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,720
mil

708
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,839
three times a day hold it under their

709
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,960
tongue for as long as they can

710
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,279
and we basically see them every week

711
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
and we actually also look at thc

712
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,879
positive status over time because the

713
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,759
other question for lots of folks across

714
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,520
the country is

715
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,960
hey if i'm using something that's

716
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,639
derived from hemp i'm never going to be

717
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,400
positive for thc

718
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,559
and i don't have to worry about it if

719
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,000
you know my workplace is testing or if

720
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,639
i'm worried about

721
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,319
any other kind of um surveillance i

722
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,400
shouldn't worry because it's from him

723
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,079
i can never be positive and we were very

724
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,679
interested in figuring out whether that

725
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,960
was true or not because i don't think

726
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,038
i didn't think it was true now we know

727
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,360
it's not true um

728
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,319
but so far we've completed the open

729
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,879
label phase

730
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,079
and we have not published the clinical

731
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,080
or the cognitive data

732
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,439
yet but i can tell you that the data is

733
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,558
really rather extraordinary

734
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,640
and quite compelling and it looks as if

735
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,079
relative to baseline after a four week

736
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,000
trial with this

737
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:21,278
custom formulated high cbd low thc but

738
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,038
full spectrum product symptoms symptoms

739
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,119
related to anxiety

740
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,879
are significantly decreased over time we

741
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,399
also see some improvements in symptoms

742
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,400
related to depression

743
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,159
and we see improvements on measures of

744
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,400
cognitive performance so these

745
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,000
these findings actually mirror what

746
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,320
we're seeing in the larger

747
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,880
longitudinal but observational studies

748
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,798
so that's that's pretty interesting

749
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,960
absolutely and a lot of things to unpack

750
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,839
here the first being

751
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,640
lower doses of the whole plant extract

752
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,240
actually being

753
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,640
as effective as the higher dose of the

754
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,278
single compound um

755
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,120
is that the entourage effect well it's a

756
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,079
great question and that's exactly why

757
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,439
we added an arm to this particular study

758
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,960
so this study was designed

759
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,880
as i mentioned open label to double

760
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,759
blind the double blind is

761
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,278
you know patients either get placebo or

762
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,558
they get the whole plant full spectrum

763
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,159
product but what if we could

764
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:16,000
make a a product that used the same

765
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,080
base that i created the study product

766
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,919
from from but stripped away

767
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,759
the other cannabinoid constituents the

768
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,520
terpenoids and flavonoids everything

769
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,278
except for the cbd what would that

770
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,200
yield i don't know the answer to that

771
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:29,679
but that would be a perfectly matched

772
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,120
arm

773
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,519
right and that would tell us

774
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,319
definitively uh my my hunch is that

775
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,839
we're going to see

776
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,319
some differences but i don't know and

777
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,879
yes to your point i am a firm believer

778
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,720
that

779
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,320
whether it's the synergy between

780
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,240
cannabinoid constituents terpenoids

781
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,839
flavonoids etc

782
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,679
or just a few of the constitu the

783
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,119
cannabinoids themselves there is clearly

784
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,360
something that is an additive

785
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,599
property or effect at using a whole

786
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,519
plant full or even broad spectrum

787
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,119
type product versus a single extracted

788
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,440
compound

789
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,119
yeah and that i mean it makes sense and

790
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
conversations i've had with folks who

791
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,599
are

792
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,359
studying the endocannabinoid system it

793
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,678
seems to be a very

794
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,719
complex system with a lot of different

795
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,759
compounds interacting in enzymes and

796
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,319
receptors and it seems

797
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,519
unlikely that it's just one compound

798
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,759
that's producing this

799
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,839
great effect absolutely and if you look

800
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,079
at the ways in which each of the sort of

801
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,000
well-known cannabinoid constituents

802
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,599
exert or modulate effects for example

803
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,079
thc at cb1

804
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,038
or even cb2 receptors versus cbd which

805
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,599
does not appear

806
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,480
to modulate its effects um through that

807
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,839
system at all

808
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,919
but uses 5ht1a trip there's

809
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,759
all sorts of other things happening here

810
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,960
um again i think you get a bigger bang

811
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,480
for the buck so to speak

812
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,319
when you're using something that's a

813
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,400
phone or broad spectrum product

814
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,359
and it will be really something to be

815
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,278
able to

816
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,599
actually have data empirically sound

817
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,519
data to support that theory which is

818
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,839
a theory that you know some of us have

819
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,200
had for a long time but i can understand

820
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,038
on the other side people say look a

821
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,720
molecule is a molecule and you know it's

822
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,000
probably just this well

823
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,640
i'm not so sure and

824
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,599
another thing about um that stood out to

825
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
me when you were talking about the

826
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,399
clinical trial is

827
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,720
again you're seeing the improvement and

828
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,679
cognitive function um for folks that are

829
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,798
using cannabis

830
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,240
so do you have any idea of what's sort

831
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,398
of causing this

832
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,240
improvement in cognitive function is it

833
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,639
you know actually that it's

834
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,759
making the brain work better is it that

835
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,919
they're using less

836
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,240
of other medications or some combination

837
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,360
of all of these factors

838
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,599
another really good question um so you

839
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,119
know

840
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,519
for a four-week clinical trial here's

841
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,639
what i can say when you see improvements

842
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,000
in cognitive performance and you also

843
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,399
see clinical improvements

844
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
so a reduction in anxiety or let's say

845
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,079
depressive symptoms

846
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,440
the question is are they doing better on

847
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:52,879
cognitive tests because

848
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,919
they're less anxious and then they can

849
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,240
actually focus more effectively

850
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,159
is it that they are no longer leaning

851
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,679
into or leaning on

852
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,760
concomitant medications like

853
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,399
benzodiazepines or other anxiolytics

854
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,398
that can

855
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,000
compromise cognitive performance we're

856
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:09,519
not necessarily empowered to see that

857
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,798
from the open label phase

858
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,798
we will look more closely at that in the

859
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,480
double-blind phase but

860
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,000
um you know i think there's a lot of

861
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,079
things at play again

862
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,839
the longitudinal observational study

863
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,079
that we've been doing for several years

864
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:25,278
at this point again it looks at folks

865
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,839
using their own regimen over time with a

866
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,000
really comprehensive set of assessments

867
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,839
and so far what we're seeing is

868
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
improvements in cognitive performance

869
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,038
and clinical state quality of life sleep

870
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,398
etc

871
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,879
and a reduction in conventional

872
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,079
medications so the question becomes is

873
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,799
it that these folks

874
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,000
are older than uh you know our

875
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:45,359
recreational consumers who

876
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,200
showed some decrements on some of these

877
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,240
cognitive measures is it that they're

878
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,159
clinical

879
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,440
symptoms that have led them to wanting

880
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,200
to use cannabis in the first place

881
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,960
whether it's chronic pain or

882
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,120
you know in our clinical trial anxiety

883
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,880
etc so those symptoms are better so they

884
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,678
can focus more effectively and think

885
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,600
more clearly or is it a reduction in

886
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,960
medication use are they sleeping better

887
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,759
and therefore they can process more

888
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,079
effectively

889
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,038
what i call the direct versus indirect

890
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,918
impact

891
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,558
of using a cannabinoid-based product on

892
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,159
cognitive vision

893
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:17,839
and you sort of already answered this

894
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,120
question but i guess i'll direct i'll

895
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,158
ask it anyway

896
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,199
is there is there any research into

897
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,440
cognitive performance with other

898
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,798
anti-anxiety

899
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,000
medications do they also improve it or

900
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:34,240
or not you know it's a an

901
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,919
important area to look at by and large

902
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,440
most folks who are on

903
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,240
different types of conventional

904
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,320
medications don't typically report

905
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,000
improvements secondary to the medication

906
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,079
specifically right um

907
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,200
so i would have to look at that um

908
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,480
actually and that's

909
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,360
that's an interesting thought in terms

910
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,278
of a very nice comp sort of comparison

911
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,759
typically what you hear from patients

912
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,640
who are on anxiolytics or things to help

913
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,879
them relax

914
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,399
or sleep is you know i have this

915
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,360
fuzziness

916
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,798
bit of a hangover i can't think clearly

917
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,199
we've all heard stories of people

918
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,079
using different medications who you know

919
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,679
had a little bit

920
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,119
of difficulty let's say the next thing

921
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,080
is like oh you know it's this it's this

922
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,759
little cloud

923
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,678
i can't shake this cloud i used to call

924
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,278
it the cognitive cloud

925
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,278
and that was very common in folks with

926
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,480
anxiety but you know i don't know of

927
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,599
studies that have done

928
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,720
acute challenges these are more

929
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,158
sort of observational studies of folks

930
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,640
who are using these types of products

931
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,960
who

932
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,799
who then you know report these types of

933
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,240
of cognitive difficulties but that's

934
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:37,278
that's an interesting question from an

935
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,399
acute

936
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:43,359
administration perspective

937
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,599
so i'm curious what are sort of the more

938
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,599
traditional or conventional medications

939
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,278
doing that cannabis is doing differently

940
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,038
so i think it depends on the class of

941
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:53,839
medication you're talking about and i

942
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:55,440
think you know

943
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,879
you sort of hit on it earlier when you

944
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,240
said is that the is that the

945
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,960
entrepreneurship effect with regard to

946
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,399
canvas

947
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,240
you know one of the things that i think

948
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,839
is so extraordinary and still

949
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,200
so relatively so it's understudied

950
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:12,558
is what do we expect when we involve

951
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,080
different quote players who exert or

952
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:16,398
modulate effects using different

953
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,480
mechanisms versus a medication

954
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,398
let's say a conventional medication that

955
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,399
we know is a selective serotonin

956
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,839
inhibitor right an ssri common treatment

957
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,518
for depression

958
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,879
or anxiolytics or even you know opioids

959
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,038
what is it that's different about

960
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,440
cannabis in my mind one of the things

961
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:32,798
that's

962
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,720
one of the things that's different is

963
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,759
that you have multiple

964
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,440
players addressing multiple systems

965
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:45,200
and so you're much more likely to have

966
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,000
an effect that does not necessarily

967
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,640
confer

968
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,440
some of the same downsides right this as

969
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,640
something that

970
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,120
is not as as broad i guess i would say

971
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,679
um to me that's that's incredibly

972
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,639
important

973
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,080
and again using the philosophy i think

974
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,159
of most

975
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,759
conventional medication approaches you

976
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,240
always want to use the lowest effective

977
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,519
dose

978
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,519
right the lowest effective dose required

979
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,359
to get let's say symptom relief

980
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,120
i think that in our studies what we're

981
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,959
finding is patients often begin using a

982
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,278
certain regimen and then they wind up

983
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,038
reducing the amount that they're using

984
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,960
it's interesting we haven't seen

985
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,319
people necessarily using higher and

986
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,798
higher and higher doses of certain

987
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,000
things

988
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:25,359
we actually see a little bit of a

989
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,480
reduction over time i don't know that

990
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,479
that will hold

991
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,159
but that's interesting because the

992
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,679
question i would then have is what

993
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,360
does their endocannabinoid profile

994
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,120
look like over time which is something

995
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,599
that we'll also be looking at so

996
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:42,879
you know what do endogenous or inherent

997
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,839
levels of let's say anandamide or 2ag

998
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,679
our own endocannabinoids what do those

999
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,639
levels look like at the beginning of the

1000
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,559
study

1001
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,559
versus midpoint when they're using you

1002
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,759
know a product with

1003
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,879
this amount of thc or cbd versus the end

1004
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:58,558
but it might be a different

1005
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,799
story that would be very interesting to

1006
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:01,678
look at so that is very interesting so

1007
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,720
you're actually

1008
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,360
testing for endocatabates

1009
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,679
well we haven't begun that part of our

1010
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,359
studies yet but we have this set up now

1011
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,840
so we're very very excited to be able to

1012
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,199
do that because i think that's one piece

1013
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,879
you know that's that's an incredibly

1014
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,120
important part of the puzzle you know

1015
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,200
it's one thing again in the literature

1016
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,278
to look at you know studies that have

1017
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,679
used either non-plant derived products

1018
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,519
or

1019
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,080
thc exclusively on acute symptoms like

1020
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,640
pain

1021
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,158
or muscle spasticity as a function of ms

1022
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,200
or nausea and vomiting

1023
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,240
as a function of chemotherapy you know

1024
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,080
it's one thing to look at at

1025
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,919
again that type of administration but

1026
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,879
the big question is

1027
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,559
when when we really want to know what's

1028
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,480
the impact of cannabinoid-based

1029
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,960
treatment we want to look

1030
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,079
at clinical and cognitive and

1031
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,038
conventional medication

1032
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,558
use all the you know the sort of outcome

1033
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,960
variables that we can think of sleep

1034
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,359
quality of life and some of the

1035
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,159
neurobiologic variables that we can

1036
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,158
look at even from imaging whether it's

1037
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,960
in vivo brain metabolite ratios or how

1038
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,760
much

1039
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,119
of a certain brain metabolite you have

1040
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,520
let's say at the beginning of a study

1041
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,960
versus at the end of the study or what

1042
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,480
your brain structural function would

1043
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,119
look like all of these things will help

1044
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,039
us

1045
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,440
to build a much more comprehensive

1046
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,599
picture of what is possible

1047
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,599
and so i think getting a profile the

1048
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,320
endocannabinoid system

1049
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,159
before during and perhaps after clinical

1050
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,919
trials or even longitudinal studies will

1051
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,398
be very helpful

1052
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,078
absolutely and you know it's a question

1053
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,598
i've asked a few other guests who've

1054
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,159
been talking about the endocannabinoid

1055
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,639
system

1056
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,919
is there a a test a panel that you can

1057
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,119
run and sort of

1058
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,440
get a profile of what your

1059
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,399
endocannabinoids look like

1060
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,280
and it didn't seem like there there was

1061
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,199
at least not

1062
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,960
widely available so it's really exciting

1063
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,678
that that you are going to be testing

1064
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,679
for that that's

1065
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,960
that's really interesting it's certainly

1066
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,280
not um

1067
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,400
what i would call you know a simple

1068
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,160
straightforward thing where you go and

1069
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,400
buy this thing off the shelf right

1070
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:05,358
and in 20 minutes you have a panel nope

1071
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,280
if only

1072
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,960
um and it is not trivial with regard to

1073
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,960
the expense or amount of

1074
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,320
uh effort required to do this but

1075
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,320
frankly you know

1076
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,160
having the very first neuroimaging study

1077
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,000
of medical cannabis patients wasn't so

1078
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,559
easy either but you have to do it

1079
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and it's really important especially if

1080
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,679
you can control

1081
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,519
what patients are taking in a clinical

1082
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:29,279
trial and really look at this

1083
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:31,759
data again before and after

1084
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,440
you can really begin to make some um

1085
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,400
important discoveries i think about what

1086
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,720
is and perhaps is not happening

1087
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,480
great and now i guess i have to ask

1088
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:44,078
we've heard all of the the great

1089
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,639
benefits that cannabis

1090
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,720
can can give especially in this this

1091
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,480
clinical trial for anxiety are there any

1092
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,879
downsides

1093
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,880
sure you know i think with um with

1094
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,640
anything with any compound that actually

1095
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,559
can yield any effect you always have to

1096
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,719
be mindful right of what

1097
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,719
what we call the good the bad and the

1098
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,719
truth right

1099
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,399
with regard to cannabis or cannabinoids

1100
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:07,919
you know so many constituents have been

1101
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,358
touted for so many things

1102
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,519
and i'm the first to tell you that the

1103
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,358
open label data is incredibly compelling

1104
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,960
but it's open label data

1105
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,719
and these patients know that they're

1106
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,119
getting quote the sauce

1107
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,719
so there is potential for you know

1108
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,440
expectancy effects to creep in we

1109
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,959
actually have

1110
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,039
begun looking at that and it's a really

1111
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,800
interesting story i will tell you i

1112
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,199
don't think the study findings are

1113
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,039
related to that um but to your point

1114
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,919
whether you're talking about cbd

1115
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,519
thc or whole plant products full

1116
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,079
spectrum products broad spectrum

1117
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,000
products

1118
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,720
it's important for people to remember

1119
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,719
that cannabis

1120
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,239
is complex and some of these

1121
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,598
constituents including

1122
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,719
cbd especially cbd and thc interact with

1123
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,240
things like

1124
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,719
the primary enzyme system of the liver

1125
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,039
this

1126
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,639
cytochrome p450 enzyme system which

1127
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,480
means that inadvertently

1128
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,920
consumers could increase or decrease

1129
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,559
amounts of other

1130
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,200
medications or products that's important

1131
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,679
so

1132
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,838
it's something to be mindful of i think

1133
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,879
that products that are particularly high

1134
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:10,799
in thc

1135
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,880
could be problematic for some folks for

1136
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,839
example who are

1137
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,358
perhaps with all great intentions some

1138
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,480
some folks get information

1139
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,239
from cannabis devotees who say look

1140
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,199
i use this concentrate and it was

1141
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,799
fantastic for me and i felt so chill

1142
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,799
they may not know that the person that

1143
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,800
they're recommending this to has

1144
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,400
you know more than let's just say minor

1145
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,800
symptoms of anxiety

1146
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,960
or they have a genetic predisposition

1147
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,440
and a very strong family history for

1148
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,280
perhaps psychotic disorder we don't know

1149
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,320
enough about this just yet

1150
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,400
um it could exacerbate some

1151
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,838
let's say less desirable the facts we

1152
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,480
don't want that to happen so i think

1153
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,799
it's always

1154
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,079
important to be mindful of the potential

1155
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,240
downside

1156
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,359
and not go into these things assuming

1157
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,039
that it's

1158
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,279
absolutely been on they can do nothing

1159
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,880
but be helpful

1160
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,800
yeah i think that's good advice and i

1161
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,960
think it's always good to

1162
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,680
seek out the the council of experienced

1163
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,000
medical professionals who who are used

1164
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,519
to

1165
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,119
administering cannabis that can help

1166
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,719
kind of guide you in your journey for

1167
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,240
sure

1168
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,919
it's hard because everybody's also we're

1169
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,679
not all created equally right so from

1170
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,358
the genetic perspective that's a

1171
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,719
that's a tough one and you know people

1172
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,960
say oh you know

1173
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,399
we know that cannabis causes psychosis

1174
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,000
well i'm not really

1175
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,838
sure that we have the data to say that

1176
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,880
but could it certainly make things worse

1177
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:33,599
for people

1178
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,599
with latent psychotic you know with

1179
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,760
either prodromal symptoms or

1180
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,760
very strong family or genetic histories

1181
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,280
um this is something to be mindful of

1182
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,520
um doesn't mean you can never use it

1183
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,680
means you need to it's sort of like

1184
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,800
not buyer beware but buyer be aware

1185
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,838
right be mindful

1186
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,599
um know what's what's uh what's in your

1187
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,279
weed so to speak i think it's incredibly

1188
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,800
important

1189
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,240
absolutely and i think that might be a

1190
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,839
great place to stop i definitely want to

1191
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,078
be respectful of your time and

1192
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,880
very much appreciate you taking the time

1193
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,359
to to be

1194
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,559
on the podcast with us but before i let

1195
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,000
you go i do want to give you the

1196
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,078
opportunity to

1197
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,079
uh tell folks where they can find more

1198
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,920
information about mind about you

1199
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,440
there's a website or social media or

1200
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,119
anything that you want to

1201
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:21,119
plug please sure well thank you

1202
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,519
um i think most of the updates about

1203
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,200
the mine program has a number of

1204
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,759
different studies from the longitude

1205
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,279
observational studies to the a number of

1206
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,599
survey-based studies

1207
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,599
to the clinical trials we have a a

1208
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,440
program dedicated to veterans

1209
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,880
uh serving those who have served we have

1210
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,639
a program dedicated

1211
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,000
it's called whim or the women's health

1212
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,519
initiative that might be lots of

1213
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,199
specialized initiatives

1214
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,199
and you can learn more about that at

1215
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,960
www.stacydoctorstacygruber.com or just

1216
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,599
dr staceygruber.com

1217
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,199
and that's actually the same for social

1218
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,280
media for twitter and

1219
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,799
instagram i think so that's a great

1220
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,640
place to find some of

1221
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,320
some of the latest greatest stuff that's

1222
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:03,440
coming out the lab including the

1223
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,760
the very newest study looking at him the

1224
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,599
the clinical trial product and the thc

1225
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,359
positive status was really

1226
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,039
quite an interesting discovery so it's

1227
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:12,480
important i would check it out

1228
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,480
if you're using a hemp based product and

1229
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,280
think nah i could never turn positive on

1230
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,639
a urine test

1231
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,800
well oh that's not the case huh

1232
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,559
not the case fifty percent of our sample

1233
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,039
was positive after four weeks

1234
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:27,199
despite zero reports zero reports of

1235
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,519
intoxication are feeling high

1236
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:32,239
and there was no relationship to the

1237
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,318
actual amount of study product used

1238
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,439
we weigh the bottles on the way out and

1239
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,800
on the way in

1240
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,679
or body mass so didn't matter how big

1241
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,039
the folks were

1242
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,879
or how much product they were taking we

1243
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:44,559
saw a relationship only with urinary

1244
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,240
creatinine which is a measure of you

1245
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,119
know kidney function and hydration

1246
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,838
so really really important especially

1247
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,838
for

1248
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,440
people who think you know these urine

1249
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:54,318
tests you know the lower limit of

1250
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,639
detection is

1251
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,599
very often 50 nanograms per ml or in the

1252
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,719
workplace sometimes

1253
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,359
15 our data also suggests that for some

1254
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,318
of those

1255
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,358
assays um they are more sensitive than

1256
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:07,358
they are

1257
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:09,519
supposed to be we see positive results

1258
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,078
at far lower levels than 50 nanograms

1259
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:11,679
per ml

1260
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,920
so we do the in-house test and then we

1261
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,199
send it out for quantification using

1262
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,559
gcms and we were

1263
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:20,318
rather surprised wow so are you doing

1264
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,119
are you performing potency testing on

1265
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,119
the product

1266
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,280
itself as well so is there just a lot

1267
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,760
more thc than folks think is in there

1268
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,079
oh no no not this isn't potency testing

1269
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,240
this is just um thc positive status for

1270
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,519
the the clinical trial patients

1271
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,358
um see so would you be positive if you

1272
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,239
used a hemp derived product that's high

1273
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,519
in cbd

1274
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:45,199
and very low in thc and i'll tell you

1275
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:47,199
our study product has between 0.27 to

1276
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,199
0.29 migs per mil

1277
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,799
that's not by weight that's migs per ml

1278
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,559
okay and

1279
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,000
um a whole lot more cbd than that

1280
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,279
somewhere around 10 minutes per ml which

1281
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,880
doesn't sound like a lot

1282
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,880
but three times a day you know it's

1283
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,519
about 30 is the targeted dose for this

1284
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,358
study

1285
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,199
and after such a low level so that's

1286
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,119
less than one milligram of thc

1287
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,719
per day after four weeks would you be

1288
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,440
positive and the answer is

1289
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,159
half of the sample was positive that's

1290
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,760
important

1291
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,159
especially since products that you can

1292
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,480
buy commercially online

1293
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,279
you can have point three percent by

1294
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,519
weight which

1295
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,200
uh again ours is point zero two since

1296
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,519
more than ten times

1297
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,239
the amount of thc as in our study

1298
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,440
product

1299
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:29,439
is legal and our study folks half of the

1300
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,200
sample was positive after four weeks

1301
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,599
but despite never feeling high or

1302
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,199
intoxicated at all nothing like that

1303
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,200
interesting were you only testing after

1304
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:40,078
four weeks or was it every week and

1305
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:41,118
it um kind of accumulates in the body or

1306
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,920
how is that

1307
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,640
we didn't test after every week actually

1308
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,559
no i'm sorry

1309
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,759
we have in lab testing we can actually

1310
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,440
look at that data the big question

1311
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,800
really was after four weeks

1312
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,838
um but we did we sent uh laboratory

1313
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,079
um we had laboratory analyses confirmed

1314
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,440
after uh week three and week five so

1315
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,318
it's after two weeks of product and four

1316
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,679
weeks of product

1317
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,318
i don't think we published the two-week

1318
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:07,358
data but we did um weekly assays

1319
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,920
in lab so really interesting stuff

1320
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:11,039
very much so so much so much to learn

1321
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,400
about this plan

1322
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,960
absolutely right never boring that's for

1323
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,559
sure

1324
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,240
well it'll keep us employed for a while

1325
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,078
hopefully

1326
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,279
let's hope so certainly couldn't be more

1327
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,160
interesting and i'll tell you

1328
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,599
with the the sheer numbers of consumers

1329
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,598
and patients

1330
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,318
using cannabis for lots of different

1331
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,160
things especially our older population

1332
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,838
it's never been more important for us to

1333
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:35,679
understand you know

1334
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,599
again i always like to say the good the

1335
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,118
bad and the truth it's up to us to try

1336
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,000
to help people make the best decisions

1337
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,599
they can

1338
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,920
about a really complex but rather

1339
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,200
extraordinary plant

1340
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,760
excellent that's just what we're trying

1341
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,279
to do at canmed absolutely

1342
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,359
and i look forward to seeing you out in

1343
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,400
pasadena thanks so much it'll be great

1344
