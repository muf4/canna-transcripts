a study that evaluated the utility of

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,560
THC cof off levels in blood and saliva

61
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:54,000
for the detection of impaired

62
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,239
driving during our conversation we

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,959
discussed the different allowable limits

64
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,480
for THC levels in drivers the

65
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,878
relationship between THC levels and

66
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:08,679
impaired driving the best fluid to test

67
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:11,079
for THC levels the additive effects of

68
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,000
combining alcohol and cannabis on

69
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,799
driving impairment the differences in

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,680
how alcohol and cannabis affect driving

71
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,280
performance and

72
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,159
more before we get to my conversation

73

90
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,439
diano good afternoon Patricia thanks so

91
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:26,120
much for joining us on the podcast thank

92
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,279
you for having me all right so I'm

93
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,918
excited to talk with you today about

94
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:33,799
cannabis and driving this seems to be a

95
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,399
topic that comes up quite often as jur

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,600
different jurisdictions loosen their

97
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,799
restrictions on cannabis one of the

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,400
major concerns from lawmakers law

99
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,478
enforcement and the general public is

100
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,319
how do we keep impaired drivers off the

101
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,959
road and a lot of a lot of times the

102
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,120
question is is there an equivalent

103
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,959
breathalyzer test for cannabis and um I

104
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,639
think we all know it it turns out that

105
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,120
it's not that easy so you and your team

106
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
recently published a new study that

107
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,759
looks at this problem which I'm eager to

108
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,560
dive into but first I'd like to start

109
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,120
broadly and ask is there data that shows

110
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,240
that incidents of impair driving

111
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,759
increase in states or countries that

112
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,960
legalize

113
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,160
cannabis so that's an interesting

114
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:21,638
question and the data as most things in

115
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,800
the field is is not 100% you know clear

116
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,280
one way or the other I should say that

117
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,240
most of the research has been done uh up

118
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,599
till a couple years ago was mostly done

119
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,400
in the US so looking at uh states that

120
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,720
legalized cannabis either for medical

121
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:40,439
reasons number of years ago or more

122
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,280
recently for recreational Reas uh

123
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,319
purposes and compared pre- and post or

124
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,839
they compared legal versus non-legal

125
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,439
States so there are two different ways

126
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,959
to do this and some studies found that

127
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,680
the incidents of imp parent driving

128
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,560
after cannabis or driving under the

129
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,720
influence of cannabis went up with

130
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,959
legalization and others found that it

131
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,440
went down others found that it stayed

132
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,719
the same so it's actually not that clear

133
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,759
um you may ask why would it go down why

134
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,039
would um driving under the influence of

135
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,240
cannabis go down after legalization

136
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:17,598
there's three possible explanations one

137
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,759
is that people with increased access to

138
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:22,719
cannabis seem to be switching from using

139
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,439
alcohol to using cannabis and we know

140
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,800
that although cannabis is bad for

141
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,680
driving it does impair driving it's not

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,919
as bad as alcohol so perhaps we're

143
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,478
seeing fewer

144
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,359
arrests because the driving is is still

145
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,439
impaired but not as impaired um also

146
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,038
there could be more um increased

147
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,279
enforcement of driving under the

148
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,478
influence of cannabis in legal states

149
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,000
than non-legal States so we're we're

150
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:48,439
picking it up so we're we're just

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,038
there's more enforcement of it in those

152
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,199
States interesting okay and so no and

153
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,560
that's a good point you are you're

154
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,478
joining us from Canada and as I

155
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,918
understand it there are established

156
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,439
limits for THC concentration

157
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,598
for drivers in Canada what are those and

158
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,598
sort of you know based on your research

159
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:09,639
or your knowledge in the area um do you

160
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:12,319
have an opinion is that too low too high

161
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:15,120
or so the legal limits vary by

162
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,360
jurisdiction some some don't have limits

163
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,319
others have limits of blood THC so THC

164
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,800
being a psychoactive component of

165
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,479
cannabis that's thought too in par

166
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,478
driving um of five five nanograms per

167
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:32,159
Mill seems to be the the limit that most

168
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:34,038
people sort of um talk about and in

169
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,400
Canada we have two different limits one

170
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:39,360
is two nanograms per Mill which is sort

171
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,318
of the lower uh level of offense and

172
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,400
then five nanograms per Mill which is a

173
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,039
higher level of offense and so the

174
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:48,198
jurisdictions vary some have a zero

175
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,240
tolerance which has a zero nanogram per

176
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,439
Mill threshold and others have two

177
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,519
others have five um so in the paper that

178
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,478
you have mentioned uh what what we

179
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,318
looked at was whether or not there's a

180
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:04,959
relationship of THC and the blood to

181
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,720
impaired driving of course one way to

182
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,079
deter driving after the use of cannabis

183
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,319
is to look at blood THC um and and see

184
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:15,878
how that and see what the levels are so

185
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,759
if a police officer suspects somebody of

186
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,720
being impaired uh after cannabis they

187
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,639
can pull them over they can do a number

188
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,520
of roadside tests then they can take

189
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,240
them back to a lab to to have blood

190
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,198
drawn and what we found which is coming

191
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,560
out of the literature sure more and more

192
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:36,080
although it's not again it's not 100%

193
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:39,559
one way or the other is that as as blood

194
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,000
THC goes up we don't necessarily see an

195
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,918
exact relationship to changes in driving

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,839
so we look at weaving which is the

197
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,639
amount of departure from a lane which is

198
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,000
a measure that's very consistently

199
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,838
affected by cannabis and Other Drugs so

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,720
just how much you deviate when you're

201
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,160
moving in your lane so we call it

202
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,560
weaving the scientific term is standard

203
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:02,360
deviation of lateral position so we

204
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,719
looked at that and tried to see how that

205
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,360
relates to blood

206
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,160
THC and we didn't see that there was a

207
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,240
clear relationship so as blood THC

208
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,519
levels went up we didn't necessarily see

209
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,278
an exact correspondence of changes in

210
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,519
driving some people were impaired at

211
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:20,240
higher levels the blood THC others Wen

212
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,759
there wasn't an exact

213
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,720
relationship but if we sort of broke it

214
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,559
down by the 5 nanogram per Mill

215
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,278
threshold and looked at those who were

216
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,759
above versus those who were below we

217
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,879
found that those two groups were

218
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,838
different so there seems to be some

219
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,919
Merit in those limits that we do seem to

220
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,800
be detecting um some measure of

221
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,439
impairment although I have to put the

222
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,919
caveat in there that that was just for

223
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,160
smoked cannabis we may see differences

224
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:51,399
with Edibles or other roots of

225
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,879
administration interesting so as the

226
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:57,399
concentration goes up you don't

227
00:09:52,879 --> 00:10:00,919
necessarily see um additional impairment

228
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:05,159
but that five nanogram uh per per Mill

229
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:07,159
or what was it five per Mill perfect um

230
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,799
that was kind of a clear cut off that

231
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,919
you're most likely going to be impaired

232
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,159
if if you if you go beyond that how does

233
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,719
that and now how does that Co how does

234
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,199
that compare with something that people

235
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,639
are probably more familiar with like

236
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,320
alcohol is there more of a linear linear

237
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,759
relationship there I believe that there

238
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
is with blood alcohol it's more

239
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,799
straightforward because um you're you're

240
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,879
measuring more directly sort of an a

241
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,439
vape that come off the breast so it's a

242
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,399
more clear relationship with with

243
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,320
cannabis you measuring blood THC which

244
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,200
has gets acted on by enzymes more in a

245
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,120
more different way so it's not quite

246
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,160
clear that what's in the blood is

247
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
necessarily reflecting what's in the

248
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,039
brain and what's working in terms of

249
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,839
impairment with canab with alcohol

250
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,159
there's more of a clear relationship

251
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,240
between the the what comes off the

252
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,559
breath and what is found in uh in

253
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,759
driving it's more it's more of a

254
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,078
challenge with

255
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,639
cannabis right yeah and I want to kind

256
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,359
of dig into that because I think there's

257
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,360
a number of different challenges if I'm

258
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,680
understand correctly and one of them

259
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,278
being that there's a number of different

260
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,919
fluids that can be tested and I know

261
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:15,120
that your your paper kind of looked at

262
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:18,838
this kind of saliva versus urine versus

263
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,480
uh blood so what is sort of the the best

264
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:26,440
one to use so right now at the roadside

265
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,320
uh what is happens I know in Canada for

266
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,800
sure I I think it's similar in the US if

267
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,560
a a officer suspect somebody of being

268
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,319
impaired they they pull them over and

269
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,439
they do a a standardized field sobriety

270
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,440
test which is the you know touching your

271
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,600
nose and looking at uh the stagis and

272
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,079
and your ability to walk in the one leg

273
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,759
stand uh you know your balance and

274
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:51,199
things like that which we've all seen on

275
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,759
TV I'm sure we're a little bit familiar

276
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,759
with what that looks like uh and then

277
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,720
they're also able to do at the roadside

278
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,958
and I know in Canada we use this it's a

279
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,920
saliva test that measures it gives you a

280
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,439
reading that says positive or negative

281
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:08,159
if you're above a certain level or not

282
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,000
and then there's the blood which they

283
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,000
can take you back to the lab and they

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,399
can look at the blood levels of THC as

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,759
well then there's urine of course um

286
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,360
which is a bit of a different Beast

287
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,439
because with urine you're measuring the

288
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,159
breakdown products of cannabis you're

289
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,399
measuring what it comes off the Cannabis

290
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:31,078
whereas with saliva and blood you're

291
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,759
measuring uh THC uh directly so for that

292
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:37,919
reason urine probably isn't a great

293
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:41,159
indicator of recent use also as we know

294
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:44,159
the these breakdown products of cannabis

295
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:47,039
of THC can last in the urine for days

296
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,838
weeks very a very long time so it is not

297
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,919
a great indicator of very recent use it

298
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,399
just says that somebody has used in the

299
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:58,879
past few days or potentially longer

300
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:01,000
whereas Salva tells you more of a small

301
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,240
short time window in the past sort of 12

302
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,559
hours and blood can give you a more

303
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,240
definitive timeline um you know if

304
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,638
somebody has very high levels of blood

305
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,799
THC then you know they've used fairly

306
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:15,079
recently or smoked fairly recently um

307
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,000
and and if they're lower than they would

308
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:19,198
have used at some point in the past day

309
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,198
or so so that's more of an accurate time

310
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:24,278
window for blood and

311
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:26,240
saliva right and now is it fairly easy

312
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:29,360
to kind of look at the concentrations in

313
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,759
the blood or saliva and sort of Trace

314
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,240
backwards how much cannabis the person

315
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,720
could have ingested again I'm I'm sorry

316
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,639
I'm gonna keep doing this I'm Gonna Keep

317
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,680
kind of doing the comparison to alcohol

318
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:45,000
but you know if you're at like a 08 um

319
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,198
alcohol level you can kind of kind of go

320
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,159
back and be like okay they've probably

321
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:49,958
had a few a few drinks at least in the

322
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,480
past hour or two can you do a similar

323
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:55,919
thing with cannabis it's really uh to to

324
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,879
estimate the last time of use and the

325
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,439
exact amount of use is quite challenging

326
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:03,720
with cannabis because the amount of THC

327
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:07,560
in blood and urine is really dependent

328
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,879
on a lot of factors including age sex

329
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,399
how often you use cannabis what form of

330
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,559
cannabis you've used so we know that

331
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,879
smoked and Vaped cannabis produce very

332
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:20,719
much higher levels very quickly in Blood

333
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:23,679
and saliva than with uh Edibles for

334
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,879
example but Edibles last very a lot

335
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,239
longer than smoked with smoked or Vaped

336
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:31,000
it's gone in five hours with Edibles

337
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,079
that's much it can last much longer so

338
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,360
if somebody comes up with 10 nanograms

339
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:37,519
per Mill of

340
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,759
THC uh it's really hard to know what

341
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,039
kind of cannabis they used and when they

342
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,720
last used it also um people who use

343
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:50,120
frequently the Cannabis might stick

344
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:53,120
around longer in the blood urine than

345
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,039
people who use infrequently so it's it's

346
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,639
it's very it's very challenging we we

347
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,360
can tell you've used recently but we

348
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,360
don't know exactly how much or when that

349
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,440
was excellent all right and so let's dig

350
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,240
into the study you did uh more

351
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,600
specifically so um please explain kind

352
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,600
of what is it that you looked at um and

353
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,360
sort of what makes this study maybe

354
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,320
different or more unique than the other

355
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,159
ones that have been been done kind of

356
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,839
more

357
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,879
recently so what we did differently was

358
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,639
we compared what the standard approach

359
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,360
is to look at relationships of left THC

360
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,240
to driving versus what we thought might

361
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,039
be informative in terms of what the

362
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,120
legal limits mean so traditionally what

363
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,639
people do is they do a correlation so a

364
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,159
statistical correlation they look for a

365
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,919
onetoone mapping of blood THC to uh

366
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:47,600
changes in driving so the person who has

367
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:49,919
the highest level of blood THC would

368
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,920
also have the highest level of change in

369
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,039
driving and the person with the lowest

370
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,479
would have blood THC would have the

371
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,360
lowest change in driving and everyone in

372
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,519
the middle would sort of map out you

373
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,639
know correspondingly incrementally

374
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,799
within that within that range um and

375
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,560
what we find is that correlation is very

376
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:10,198
is is is not necessarily so

377
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,958
straightforward so some people find

378
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:16,240
there is a correlation others don't so

379
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:18,278
we ask are the legal limits somehow

380
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,120
informative as opposed to just trying to

381
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:24,919
find a simple relationship between blood

382
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,720
THC and driving so um given that the you

383
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,000
know we have these legal limits in

384
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,278
Canada and other jurisdiction they help

385
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,039
us detect who is not capable or not fit

386
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,360
to drive at the time and the conclusion

387
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,759
was that those who were above the higher

388
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,480
the more uh greater offense of blood

389
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,759
THC were were definitely more impaired

390
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,000
than those who are below that level so

391
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,600
our conclusion was that these limits may

392
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,759
have some utility um of course we did

393
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,199
have you know our caveats in there it's

394
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,159
just for smoking right now we don't know

395
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,198
all of the roots of administration we

396
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:02,600
don't know difference in frequency of

397
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:05,438
use how that would affect it but just

398
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:10,038
basically that the limits may have some

399
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:14,038
utility great you and I'm curious too um

400
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:15,558
how did you sort of look at the the the

401
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:17,119
difference in time from when they

402
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:19,359
actually used and when the test was

403
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,318
administered was it like quickly after

404
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,279
or did you kind of give them time to

405
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:26,438
maybe sober up a little bit like how did

406
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,720
how was that how did that work so they

407
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,960
they all they were all invited to the

408
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,200
for standard test sessions there were

409
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,038
there were four test sessions um and

410
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,720
this was a part of a larger study

411
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,319
looking at the effects of alcohol and

412
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,400
cannabis combined so when you take

413
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:44,558
alcohol and cannabis together um does it

414
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,000
make driving a lot worse than just

415
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:51,359
alcohol or cannabis on their own and how

416
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,440
much worse is is it combining the two so

417
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,599
we had four conditions one in which they

418
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,960
just drank alcohol to a breath alcohol

419
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:02,678
of well the target Target was 008 which

420
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,960
is the legal limit in Canada which is

421
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,120
about three about three drinks I think

422
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,519
depending on the size of the person and

423
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:15,000
then the other condition they smoked uh

424
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:16,720
cannabis 12.5% THC joint they were given

425
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,599
and the other condition they had the two

426
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,360
combined and the fourth test session it

427
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,959
was just a placebo so it was just a fake

428
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,719
alcohol fake cannabis and they didn't

429
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,038
know what they were getting at each test

430
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,440
session so it was they they they were

431
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,759
just given a drink and it could have had

432
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,200
vodka or or could have just had lime

433
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,798
juice and they didn't know and similarly

434
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,200
with the Cannabis cigarette so uh they

435
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,720
didn't know what they were given on a

436
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,480
certain day and what we did was they

437
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,919
came in and they went to our what we

438
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,839
call our bar lab it's a lab which looks

439
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:54,120
like a bar basically and they drank um a

440
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,918
drink of vodka a vodka drink which

441
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,079
doesn't smell doesn't has very little

442
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,280
taste so we could mask it quite easily

443
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,839
with the non-alcohol condition and then

444
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,279
about half an hour later they were

445
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,359
invited uh to our smoking lab negative

446
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:11,960
pressure room where they were asked to

447
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:14,000
smoke the Cannabis and uh to to the

448
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,400
usual level of intoxication and to stop

449
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,440
if they felt sick and then about half an

450
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,880
hour later they drove the simulator so

451
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,640
it was very controlled for each person

452
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,480
was more or less the same interval

453
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,679
between each each um

454
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,038
event interesting and so now you said

455
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,080
that you evaluated whether the the

456
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,319
combination of alcohol and cannabis

457
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:38,558
would be worse than either of those

458
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:41,119
alone what were the results there so

459
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,359
that yeah so there's just to give you

460
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,959
some background there's a lot of um sort

461
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,079
of debate in the literature as to

462
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,919
whether combining alcohol and cannabis

463
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:52,319
produce what's called additive effects

464
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,600
so you just it's you know if you weave

465
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,918
or let's use the example of speed it's

466
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:00,000
probably easier to understand so if your

467
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:02,080
uh speed goes up by two miles an hour

468
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,558
under cannabis and two miles an hour

469
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,519
under alcohol if it's additive then

470
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,240
taking the two would increase the speed

471
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,759
by four but if it's interactive or

472
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,720
synergistic then it would be more than

473
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,079
four so it could be eight or 10 so the

474
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,000
two actually work to make each other a

475
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:19,439
lot worse than just the sum of their

476
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,759
parts so there's some debate in the

477
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,440
literature as to whether the effects

478
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,919
would be additive or synergistic and we

479
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,720
found that it was we believe it was

480
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,080
additive based on our data we didn't do

481
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,200
the full analysis on that but we believe

482
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:36,678
looking at the numbers it was additive

483
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,558
so their weaving uh doubled so to speak

484
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,320
with alcohol and cannabis like you just

485
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,079
added the numbers up together uh and we

486
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:45,759
published a review a couple years ago

487
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:48,599
where we looked at uh combining alcohol

488
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,240
and cannabis on driving cognition so

489
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:54,519
learning and memory and also intox

490
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,679
levels of intoxication and most papers

491
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,519
seem to show that it's an additive so

492
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,519
they're it's like summing the part parts

493
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:04,119
and combining the two is worse than

494
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:06,558
either one alone for sure great and then

495
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,599
how about cannabis versus alcohol who

496
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,158
who did

497
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:13,119
worse so we found they did similar there

498
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,039
in that one study the impairments were

499
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,239
similar so we found that cannabis

500
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,640
increased weaving which is a consistent

501
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,200
finding across almost all the studies

502
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,880
done with cannabis and driving and can

503
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,440
and alcohol also increased weaving which

504
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,919
is also very consistent uh with alcohol

505
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,640
it's pretty much Hallmark of of alcohol

506
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,840
and cannabis that's one of the things

507
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,559
that's usually uh impaired and they were

508
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:39,038
impaired to this more or less the same

509
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,038
degree after alcohol and cannabis and

510
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,960
then taking them together just D you

511
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,119
know doubled it doubled each one of

512
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,798
those um also what's generally found

513
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:51,479
with cannabis is that cannabis also in

514
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,679
slows your time to react to events on

515
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,000
the road we didn't find that but a lot

516
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,919
of studies do find that and it also uh

517
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
alers your ability to maintain a

518
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,679
distance proper distance with the car in

519
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,599
front of you and it also slows people

520
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,519
down uh because they're driving more

521
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,399
carefully people who use cannabis say

522
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,639
they're aware that they're intoxicated

523
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,840
so they slow down whereas with alcohol

524
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,520
they drive faster generally than than

525
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:21,319
slower so so that's interesting talking

526
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,359
about the the differences between

527
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:26,359
alcohol and cannabis yet again so how

528
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,639
are the impairing effects of alcohol and

529
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,879
cannabis different because I think

530
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:34,080
anyone who who's used both knows that

531
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,159
that they are different so um speak a

532
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:40,759
little bit about that so with respect to

533
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:43,600
driving um cannabis increases weaving as

534
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,558
does alcohol where they're different

535
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,119
mostly is that cannabis and the big one

536
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,000
of the big findings that we get from

537
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,239
Cannabis that seems to come out in a lot

538
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,159
of papers not all of them is that it

539
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,200
tends to slow people down because they

540
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,240
know they're

541
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,120
impaired uh so they're they're more

542
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,880
cautious on the Road doesn't mean

543
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,959
they're better driver it just means that

544
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,080
they know that they're impaired whereas

545
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,798
with alcohol they speed and they and

546
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,678
they're more they're much more reckless

547
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:12,400
drivers so I I at the beginning of the

548
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,000
interview we talked about um what the

549
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,519
effect legalization had on driving under

550
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,200
the influence of cannabis and I

551
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:22,240
mentioned

552
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,319
that in some jurisdictions the rate of

553
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,679
driving under the influence of cannabis

554
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,879
went down after legalization or with

555
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,200
legalization and that's because people

556
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,760
think that they're switching from

557
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,038
alcohol to cannabis so alcohol is much

558
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,720
worse because maybe they're not aware

559
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,679
that they're as impaired and they're

560
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,839
driving faster and they're weaving on

561
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,440
the road whereas with cannabis they're

562
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,599
aware and they're they're slowing down

563
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,360
they're compensating for their

564
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,480
impairment but they're still

565
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,119
impaired no and that's an interesting

566
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,480
point too because um that might actually

567
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,879
keep impaired drivers off the road right

568
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,278
if they know that they're impaired and

569
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,000
maybe shouldn't be driving maybe they'll

570
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,720
just choose not to

571
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,679
drive so I don't think we have data on

572
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,839
that but certainly I'm talking to the

573
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,600
participants in my studies they

574
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,319
definitely say that they don't drive

575
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,119
after they use cannabis and they're

576
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:14,278
aware that they're not driving very well

577
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,558
and they're very cautious about driving

578
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:18,919
after using cannabis and that tends to

579
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,879
be what we get a lot in in self-report

580
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:24,799
is people say that they're they're aware

581
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,080
although we do know that about 25% of

582
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,558
people who use cannabis do drive after

583
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,480
using cannabis

584
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,720
and especially with respect to medical

585
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,839
cannabis people believe that it doesn't

586
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,000
affect them so they will drive after

587
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:42,199
using cannabis for medical reasons

588
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,398
interesting um but could

589
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:50,038
it never mind we won't go there um so in

590
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:52,759
terms of measuring the concentrations in

591
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:55,079
the blood um it's my understanding too

592
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:58,398
that THC can be detected in the blood

593
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:00,960
for a a long time after use

594
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:03,959
so how do we sort of control for

595
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,759
that that's right so THC in the blood

596
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,640
can be detected in the blood blood for a

597
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:13,798
number of um days and i' I've seen

598
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,799
papers where it's above no one or or

599
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:17,839
it's above one or two nanograms per Mill

600
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:18,839
which is some of the cut offs for for

601
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,278
weeks

602
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:23,839
potentially it's generally in people who

603
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:26,359
use cannabis frequently so every every

604
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,319
day or more than once a day that we see

605
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,398
that these levels

606
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,639
continue and they persist so that is a

607
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:37,079
challenge I think um what's unknown is

608
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,360
the degree of impairment of people the

609
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,480
day after they've used cannabis it's

610
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,599
unknown right now if frequent users are

611
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,200
not good drivers the next day some

612
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,319
studies will have found that they are

613
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,159
impaired even though they haven't used

614
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,879
that day and there are some studies

615
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,720
looking at blood THC which have found

616
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,278
that people are um more impaired as the

617
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,159
blood THC goes up the day after uh using

618
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:05,319
cannabis so it's important that is a

619
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,159
good question and it's very relevant to

620
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:10,918
Medical users and very frequent users

621
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,120
who might have residual blood THC the

622
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,399
next day but that's a question that

623
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,398
still needs to be explored I think more

624
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:20,639
fully in terms of what the long-term uh

625
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,519
effects are of using

626
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,000
cannabis no and you're right and I just

627
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,639
recently spoke with a researcher in

628
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,278
Australia uh Danielle mcartney who did a

629
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,038
review of a lot of these um studies that

630
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:36,038
are looking at next day impairment and

631
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:38,000
um I mean one of her conclusions was

632
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,480
that we need more studies because they

633
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,359
weren't all of really great quality so

634
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,319
um hopefully she's gonna do some more

635
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,240
investigation into that and we can uh

636
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:50,038
get a more definitive answer but but you

637
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,359
did mention frequent users and I wanted

638
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,558
to ask you too of the participants in

639
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:57,278
your study were there um you know

640
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,119
cannabis naive users or more frequent

641
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,960
users and was there sort of a difference

642
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,959
in their

643
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,720
performance um so we the in the study

644
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,480
that we have talking about uh the

645
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,480
participants were required to use

646
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,798
cannabis at least once a week it's uh we

647
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,599
all of our studies need to get approval

648
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,480
by an Ethics board so we have to make

649
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:18,278
sure that our studies are ethical and

650
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,519
we're not putting our participants at

651
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:23,200
risk and I think one of the criteria

652
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,960
that ethics boards in my experience

653
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,240
usually have is that people who who use

654
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,079
cannabis and a research study have to

655
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,319
have experience with cannabis so you're

656
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:35,038
not potentially causing them you know

657
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,759
illness or or something an adverse event

658
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,000
in the lab so we generally recruit

659
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,640
people who use cannabis at least once a

660
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,480
week to ensure that they have experience

661
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,200
with cannabis um although that does vary

662
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,159
some people will use more frequent users

663
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,640
and some people will recruit people with

664
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,679
uh less who are less frequent users than

665
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,799
that we did not break it down in our

666
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,759
study by frequency of use and in terms

667
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:02,720
of the effect people have looked at that

668
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,759
and they have looked at occasional so

669
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,880
you know once a month users versus

670
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:11,558
frequent users so daily users or four

671
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,519
times a week more or more and and the

672
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:17,558
again as a lot of things the findings

673
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:19,759
are are inconclusive I believe uh of the

674
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:23,278
three or four studies done roughly half

675
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:25,158
find that frequent users are more

676
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,278
impaired and have find that they're less

677
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,399
impaired than the occasional user

678
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:32,240
we are looking at doing a study or we're

679
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,918
gearing up to do a study where we look

680
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,919
at frequency of use as a moderating

681
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,200
variable and also age so potentially the

682
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,799
age of the participant might interact

683
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,080
with how frequency of use influences uh

684
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:48,038
driving after using

685
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,720
cannabis great and that was going to be

686
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:51,640
my next question is sort of where do we

687
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,519
go from here and and what do you looking

688
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,960
at next and I think you just answered

689
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,839
that but if there's if there's other

690
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,200
things that you're investigating um

691
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,000
please I I think Agee is really

692
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,360
important we just finished a study

693
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,960
looking at older adults so over 65

694
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:12,398
people over 65 are the uh fastest or

695
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,679
grow fastest growing population of

696
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,439
cannabis users so the number of people

697
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,159
over 65 who use cannabis have has grown

698
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,640
exponentially in the past number of

699
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:23,278
years compared to the number of younger

700
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,440
users who are

701
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:30,159
increasing the compared to how many yeah

702
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,880
the increase in and younger adults but

703
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,720
yet they're generally overlooked in

704
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,480
research studies we know very little

705
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,839
about how cannabis affects older adults

706
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,278
so over 65 in terms of how it affects

707
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,038
memory

708
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,440
attention um and other cognitive

709
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:49,000
measures mostly memory and attention are

710
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,558
affected by cannabis we also don't know

711
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,319
very much about how it affects their

712
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:55,000
driving we finished a study and we just

713
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:57,639
finished a study where we showed that

714
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,798
people over 65 do show impairment in

715
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:04,278
driving but it's unclear as to whether

716
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:06,879
the amount of change in driving was less

717
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:09,839
than younger adults so maybe they're

718
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,960
less sensitive to cannabis that's not

719
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,759
clear uh and we don't know much about

720
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,960
how blood THC Works in older adults we

721
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:20,000
know that older adults have more more

722
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,960
body fat they have changes in metabolism

723
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,038
so that they're slower to metabolized

724
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,079
drugs so potentially blood THC could

725
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,240
break down differently in them we just

726
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:32,079
have very little information on older

727
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,919
adults

728
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,519
interesting all right um so Patricia I

729
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,519
do want to be very mindful of your time

730
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,399
I think I've I've kept you for uh for

731
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:44,038
the half hour that I U that I promised

732
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,518
but before I let you go um I wanted to

733
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:49,278
give you an opportunity to um share any

734
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,960
other additional resources on this topic

735
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,000
um that might be helpful for the

736
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,519
listeners or the viewers to to read more

737
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,880
about or um if there's a a website or

738
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,200
any way to get in touch with you um if

739
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,120
they have any additional questions or

740
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,278
just want to connect uh please plug away

741
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,038
so one resource that I use a lot which

742
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,319
is it's a Canadian Source but it might

743
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,519
be interesting to Americans in other

744
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:13,879
countries as well just in terms of

745
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,679
General statistics on cannabis use and

746
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,639
you know how many people drive after

747
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,840
using cannabis what age groups use

748
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:22,918
cannabis what kinds of cannabis do

749
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,839
people use why do they use cannabis uh

750
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,639
it's called the Canadian cannabis survey

751
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:31,398
and it's conducted by the sort of

752
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:33,038
National um in at the national level and

753
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:35,518
it's updated every year in about

754
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,119
November so if you just Google Canadian

755
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,159
cannabis survey you can see all kinds of

756
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:43,319
Statistics regarding cannabis use the

757
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,919
impact of legalization all those kinds

758
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:48,158
of questions people have again it's

759
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,559
Canadian Source but it it's I'm sure

760
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,080
that it's not that you know very

761
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:53,119
different across different countries so

762
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,599
could be

763
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,119
interesting excellent thanks I will put

764
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,879
