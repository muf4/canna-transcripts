1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,599
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,599
i like a small intimate audience

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,599
my name is robert thomas and

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,198
i have my own consulting business and

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,920
i serve the educational leads of the

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,520
cannabis industry particularly

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,118
in the field of heavy metal

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,879
determinations

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,559
i've been in this field for almost 50

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,719
years and

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,719
about three years ago i ventured into

12
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,719
the cannabis industry

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,399
and it looked attractive a little

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,480
chaotic but

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,480
something that i love working in so

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,799
today

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,398
i'm going to focus on

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,479
heavy metals

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,320
in cannabis products

20
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,679
and what we can learn

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,960
from the pharmaceutical industry

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,878
first of all i'd like to thank the

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,439
organizers for inviting me to contribute

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,280
to this session very much appreciated

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,079
i'd also like to acknowledge the

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
financial support of shimaju scientific

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,558
instruments for allowing me to

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,558
participate

29
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,760
okay so let me dive straight in

30
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,118
this is a this is a rough overview of my

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
presentation

32
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,560
um

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,719
i'll start with the current status

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,439
of heavy metal regulations for cannabis

35
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:26,560
and particularly the fractured nature of

36
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,559
a state-based system

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
and then i'll give you an historical

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,599
perspective

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,359
of how the pharmaceutical and dietary

40
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,640
supplement industries

41
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,319
approach regulating elemental impurities

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,759
after using

43
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,078
a colorimetric precipitation test for

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,000
over 100 years

45
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,279
which was totally inadequate and the

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,478
process of moving from that sulfide

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,280
colorimetric test to using plasma

48
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,158
spectrochemistry

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
um and then i'll address what the

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,320
cannabis industry

51
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,879
can learn from

52
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,798
the pharmaceutical industry particularly

53
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,519
with the risk assessment approach that

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,759
the pharmaceutical industry took to it

55
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,318
to bring in meaningful elemental

56
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,159
impurity regulations in drug products

57
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,878
and substances

58
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,479
and then i'll get my crystal ball out

59
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,479
and

60
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,799
give you my thoughts of where i think

61
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,119
the cannabis industry is going

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,239
with regard to heavy metals and

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,239
elemental impurities

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,080
okay so where is cannabis legal in the

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,919
u.s today here's a map it's fairly is

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,040
fairly current

67
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,518
the light green states represent states

68
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,919
where medicinal cannabis is legal and

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,680
dark green where both medicinal and

70
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:51,359
recreation is legal

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,599
it is legal for medicinal purposes in 18

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
states

73
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,479
but the heavy metal regulations are very

74
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,238
fractured and very disjointed so let me

75
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,679
give you a brief look

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,400
a snapshot of heavy metal regulations

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,239
so the majority of the 37 states in the

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,080
u.s regulates the big four lead cadmium

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,280
arsenic and mercury

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,760
new york adds nickel chromium

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,919
copper zinc and

82
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,719
merlin missouri and a few other states

83
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,679
add chromium to the big four

84
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,239
michigan um also includes inorganic

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,319
arsenic and not total arsenic

86
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,680
but also adds chromium copper a nickel

87
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:36,399
to the big four some states require

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,799
heavy metals in the cannabis plant while

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,120
other others give different limits for

90
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,400
the different delivery methods which is

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
oral

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,280
inhalation and transdermal

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,239
some states stipulate consumption per

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,400
day

95
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,039
while others take into consideration the

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,120
body weight of the consumer

97
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,239
some states have no heavy metal limits

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,000
at all

99
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,519
so it begs the question what does new

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,438
york state know

101
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,920
that all the other states don't know

102
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,639
because they add an additional five

103
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,679
why does michigan regulate inorganic

104
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,318
arsenic where all the other states just

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,438
specify total arsenic so these are all

106
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,679
questions

107
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,519
which are unknown and

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,319
there's no real resolution to them but

109
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,519
they are just the fractured nature of

110
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,519
state-based systems

111
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,560
and the bottom line is that

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,918
we have to look at these state-based

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,319
systems

114
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,599
and consider whether it's worth

115
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,000
improving them

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,400
expanding the elemental panel that's

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,199
currently in place today

118
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,039
or maybe looking at speciated analysis

119
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,360
these are sort of questions

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
which need to have answers to i think

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,680
before eventually federal regulators

122
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,680
come along

123
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,719
okay this table

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,120
is a list of the nine elements that are

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,759
regulated by the states in the left-hand

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
column and going across from left to

127
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,439
right

128
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,240
the first three columns are usp chapter

129
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:11,120
232 pde limits for drug products chapter

130
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,800
2232

131
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,038
limits for dietary supplements the

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,918
american herbal pharmacopoeia limits for

133
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,240
botanicals and herbal products and then

134
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,839
gone across six different states

135
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,400
california cobalt maryland new york

136
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,638
connecticut and massachusetts

137
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,719
a few things to point out the federal

138
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,759
limits are based on

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,000
micrograms per day so with most

140
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,520
pharmaceuticals they have a maximum

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,519
dosage or a suggested dosage per day

142
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,439
so the data in the first three columns

143
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,599
must be divided by the suggested dosage

144
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,560
for those particular products so for

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,560
example

146
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,079
if 10 gram is the maximum consumption

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,839
per day they must be divided by 10.

148
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,439
if you look at the state based limits

149
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,918
you'll find that some are in microgram

150
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,079
per gram some are in part per million

151
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,478
and some of them are in milligram

152
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,000
milligram per kilogram so unless you're

153
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,240
not little chemist and you're used to

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,918
dealing with different units

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,759
as a consumer

156
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,279
and other people who are working in this

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,960
field they might not have a good

158
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,119
understanding of how

159
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,279
these limits are the same or are

160
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,079
different

161
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,159
so if you look at the state-based um

162
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,560
limits and compare them with the federal

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,520
image just taking lead as an example

164
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,918
which is in the top row in red you can

165
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,719
see they are they are all very different

166
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,038
and this is fairly typical of most

167
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,199
states in the us so why don't we take a

168
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,759
look first at the federal limits and

169
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,759
then at a few state-based limits and

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,879
we'll try and get a better understanding

171
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,879
of what needs to be done

172
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:54,719
okay so the first slide uh the um the

173
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,598
federal limits for usp chapter 232

174
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,400
um for elemental impurities in drug

175
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:04,560
products and substances um

176
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:08,399
ich q 3d are similar limits ich q3d

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,478
um is a is a consortium of

178
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,439
farmers okay pharmaceutical

179
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,318
manufacturers in other parts of the

180
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:19,519
world including pharmacopeia's

181
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,800
from the u.s from japan and from europe

182
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:25,198
so the usp and the ich

183
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,000
aligned their methodology together

184
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,199
um during the 20 years it took to

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,680
actually bring these limits out so um a

186
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,439
couple of points to emphasize

187
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,079
the class or the category is the

188
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,680
toxicity classification of each of those

189
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,560
elements and i'll talk more about that

190
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
later

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,360
but basically

192
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,720
these are three they are based on three

193
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
different delivery methods or

194
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,160
administration methods oral parenteral

195
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,960
and inhalation and they are in microgram

196
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,000
per day so if you need to know what's

197
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,560
allowed in the actual product you divide

198
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,038
by the maximum dosage so if it's 10 10

199
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
grams for example you divide those by

200
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,399
10.

201
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,399
so i think it's important to understand

202
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,878
that these

203
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,279
it took a total of 20 years to bring

204
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,439
these into the public domain and i'll

205
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,279
talk a little bit about the process of

206
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,598
the pharmaceutical industry and

207
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,719
particularly united states pharmacopoeia

208
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,839
and how

209
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,840
how they arrived at that process

210
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,598
okay so this is chapter 2232 so this is

211
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,000
the limit for dietary supplements and

212
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,839
nutri nutraceuticals only

213
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,120
you'll find there's only four not 24.

214
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,440
and there's a reason behind that which

215
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,080
i'll explain later but what what you

216
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,519
might notice is that for arsenic

217
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,680
and mercury

218
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,320
they require speciated forms of the

219
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:55,679
arsenic we know that inorganic arsenic

220
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,240
is more toxic than organic arsenic and

221
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,159
because many plants and herbal

222
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,039
supplements

223
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,039
are grown from plants

224
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,319
the requirement here is if the total

225
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,360
arsenic

226
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,120
is above the pde limit per day you have

227
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,519
to speciate you have to find what is

228
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
inorganic and what is organic we know

229
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,200
that um

230
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,879
we know that pentavalent and trivalent

231
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,040
arsenic is extremely toxic compared to

232
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,278
organic arsenic the

233
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,519
asino sugars

234
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,200
and monomethyl

235
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
acetic acid

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,480
they are toxic but they're not as toxic

237
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,759
as inorganic arsenic

238
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,600
and with mercury because many

239
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,799
dietary supplements are made from kelp

240
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,320
products or fish oil

241
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,559
there's the likelihood of there being

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,360
high mercury in some of these products

243
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,518
mainly because mercury

244
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,080
once it gets into aquatic systems is

245
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,560
consumed by bottom feeders and then it

246
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,040
bioaccumulates up the food chain and the

247
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,159
predator fish have much higher mercury

248
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,639
levels

249
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,919
in them than the bottom feeders so there

250
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,838
is a chance in in a dietary supplement

251
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,559
that's made from

252
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,839
kelp or or a fish oil it could contain

253
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,838
high levels of mercury

254
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,480
okay so let's look at a few of the

255
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,159
states for comparison purposes i pick

256
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,680
california because we're in california i

257
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,519
thought it'd be a good one to start and

258
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,078
these are pretty straightforward they're

259
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,360
categorized by two different

260
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,838
categories

261
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,360
inhalable cannabis goods and all other

262
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,360
cannabis goods and these are in

263
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,120
microgram per gram and these are

264
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,720
actually the same as usp chapter 232

265
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,440
for inhalation drugs and oral drugs

266
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,040
based on 10 gram of consumption but i

267
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,360
think it's fair to say

268
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,159
that we have no way of really knowing in

269
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,200
what quantities people consume cannabis

270
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,278
so is 10 gram a realistic dosage i don't

271
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,959
know maybe it is but

272
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,958
you know we don't really know

273
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,559
how people consume cannabis and in what

274
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,799
quantities

275
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,719
and also what's unique about the

276
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,039
california regulations is that they

277
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,120
require a half a gram of sample to

278
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,360
digest to carry out the heavy metal

279
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,159
determination where most other states

280
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,480
don't put a stipulation on the minimum

281
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,480
weight

282
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,240
here's colorado they're a little bit

283
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,640
different to explain basically they're

284
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,879
categorized in three different substance

285
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,958
which is the heavy metal of concern the

286
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:34,000
acceptable limits per gram of intended

287
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,239
use and then the products to be tested a

288
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,278
few points to emphasize here

289
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,759
the

290
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:43,278
inhaled products

291
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:45,360
are derived from usp chapter 232

292
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,600
inhalation pdes

293
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,800
the topical or transdermal limits are

294
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,000
based on fda limits for cosmetics

295
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:57,199
and the oral consumption

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,679
limits are based on chapter 2232 for

297
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,000
dietary supplements so colorado has

298
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,759
taken approach of using many many

299
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,958
different sources

300
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,958
to regulate heavy metals

301
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,360
okay this is connecticut this is rather

302
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,800
unusual because you need to because you

303
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,800
need to know the body weight of the

304
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,240
consumer before you know the maximum

305
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,479
allowable limit

306
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,720
um in connecticut this is a microgram

307
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:28,000
per kilogram of body weight per day

308
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,120
so it's typical to use 60 to 60 to 70

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,519
kilogram

310
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,560
as an average body weight for a human

311
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,200
both male and female

312
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,799
but you don't know the suggested dosage

313
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,720
per day is you can't work out the

314
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,359
maximum allowable limit

315
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
in connecticut

316
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,319
okay this is a study that was put out by

317
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,320
the fda recently

318
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,120
the botanical review team of the office

319
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,440
of new drug products at the us fda

320
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,320
and they looked at eight different

321
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,639
medical cannabis programs uh state-based

322
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,800
medical cannabis programs and compared

323
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,480
them with the federal limits of usp

324
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,039
chapter 232

325
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,519
so if you look in the left hand column

326
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,879
you see the four heavy metals of concern

327
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,320
usp chapter 232 inhalation limits and

328
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,360
chapter 232 oral limits and going across

329
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,200
the table

330
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,759
you will see the limits for eight

331
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,959
different state-based systems it doesn't

332
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,200
tell you

333
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:31,599
what the state-based system which states

334
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,480
they are they just call them mcp128

335
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,159
but as you can see the data in red shows

336
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,720
inconsistency

337
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,519
and a higher than the federal usp

338
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,680
chapter 232 limits and that and that's

339
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,839
quite common across all the different

340
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,919
medical cannabis programs

341
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,920
and this study came to three conclusions

342
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,559
it said testing for these four heavy

343
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,360
metals in inhalation and oral drugs was

344
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,119
lacking in the majority of mcps it was

345
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,039
about 75 percent

346
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,519
and even when present

347
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:04,159
they were inconsistent across programs

348
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,519
and finally they did not always align

349
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,480
with usp recommendations so again this

350
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,480
shows

351
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,000
the fractured and the disjointed nature

352
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,839
of state-based

353
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,639
limits compared to federal limits for

354
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,639
pharmaceutical products

355
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,600
okay let's tell you a little bit about

356
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,278
the united states pharmacopoeia i've

357
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
worked very closely with the united

358
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,600
states pharmacopoeia

359
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,519
over the past 15 to 20 years

360
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,839
i work on the

361
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,519
acs committee for reagent chemicals i

362
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,279
lead the heavy metal

363
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,480
task force and

364
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:42,159
when usp was writing its methodology for

365
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,199
elemental impurities in pharmaceuticals

366
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:47,120
our acs committee worked very closely to

367
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,759
align the method we were working on for

368
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,399
heavy metals with the method that usp

369
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,399
was working on

370
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,198
so who are who are the usp what what is

371
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,959
their mission well

372
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,799
it's an independent non-profit and it's

373
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,278
not part of the government although they

374
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,519
do work with various government agencies

375
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,519
around the world and their mission is to

376
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,198
improve the health of people through

377
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,440
public standards

378
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,759
and these these public standards are

379
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,199
known as united states pharmacopoeia

380
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,600
national formulary or usp nf for short

381
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:22,000
and it's a book of compendium standards

382
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,519
for drug substances and products

383
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,919
and

384
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,159
they've been around for about 200 years

385
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,719
and they're recognized in about 130

386
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:34,159
countries and the fda designates the

387
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,839
uspnf as the official compendium of

388
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,838
drugs sold and marketed in the u.s

389
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:45,359
okay so how does the usp what is the usp

390
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,720
process to change a standard method or a

391
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,879
monograph

392
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,720
so this is a process which is a little

393
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,039
bit cumbersome in nature because it

394
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,360
revises standards through a unique

395
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:58,078
public collaborative process with

396
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,720
scientists in industry in academia in

397
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,198
standards organizations

398
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,680
and the acs was one of the interested

399
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,519
stakeholders in the way the usp would

400
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,838
change in their methods

401
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,919
so i lead the heavy metals task force at

402
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,639
the acs so we work very closely with

403
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,120
them

404
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,799
as we were both changing our methodology

405
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,360
for heavy metals i'll talk a little bit

406
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,439
more about the methodology in a minute

407
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,360
um but it had been around for what 100

408
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,360
years it was a colorimetric

409
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,000
precipitation test

410
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,759
which was semi-quantitative at best but

411
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,240
it didn't give you any indication of the

412
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,120
individual heavy metals

413
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,759
and

414
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,600
the usp method was described in usp

415
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,399
chapter 231

416
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,159
and in the acs

417
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,000
we developed it put it into a book of

418
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,799
reagent chemicals

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,799
and both methods were very similar

420
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,519
and because

421
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,039
acs acs grade reagent chemicals are

422
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,480
recommended by the united states

423
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,198
pharmacopoeia

424
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,519
in any analytical procedures we had to

425
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:03,359
make sure that our method aligned

426
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,078
exactly with the usp method

427
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,959
so that process took a number of years

428
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:11,279
it took it took a lot longer by usp but

429
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,558
we wanted to make sure that whatever usp

430
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,199
was doing

431
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,279
the acs method was aligned with it so on

432
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,679
the left hand side you see the book of

433
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:23,359
reagent chemicals it used to be a

434
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,199
hardback book it's now completely online

435
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,119
it's a database searchable database so

436
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,400
it's available anywhere in the world at

437
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,239
any time

438
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,559
so you can search

439
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,160
any monograph which is in the book

440
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,440
and

441
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
based on that united states

442
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,200
pharmacopoeia in their general notices

443
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,759
and requirements recommends that if any

444
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,880
pharmaceutical manufacturers are using

445
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:49,279
reagent chemicals for testing procedures

446
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,120
they must be acs grade reagent chemicals

447
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,839
so that's the reason we work very

448
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,839
closely with them

449
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,720
okay let me explain briefly what usp

450
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,720
chapter 231 is which is very similar to

451
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,640
the acs test

452
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,759
it's based on a sulfide colorimetric

453
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,640
precipitation test with an organosulfide

454
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,640
at a ph of three and when you do that

455
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,960
you precipitate the heavy metal it comes

456
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,320
down as a sulfide and it makes a very

457
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,798
cloudy

458
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,759
colloidal type suspension solution

459
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,240
and the our acs test was very similar to

460
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,440
the usp test except we use hydrogen

461
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,599
sulfide instead of an organosulfide

462
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,558
but both were semi-quantitative at best

463
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,319
and probably qualitative really

464
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,038
because you only made the comparison

465
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:40,079
against a lead standard so so no matter

466
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,558
how many elements you were trying to

467
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,960
assess in a sample you were only

468
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:48,240
comparing it against a lead standard so

469
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,400
clearly it had many limitations

470
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,200
so let's look at those limitations

471
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,798
this slide shows 12 different sulfide

472
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,519
precipitates

473
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,519
if you can imagine all 12 of those

474
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,558
elements were present in the same sample

475
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,119
how difficult it would be to compare

476
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,279
a combined precipitate against a lead

477
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,678
standard which is circled in red so it

478
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,399
was non-specific it only gave you an

479
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,200
approximation of what elements what

480
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,798
heavy metals were present in your sample

481
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
it was also it

482
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,679
also had a lousy detection capability

483
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,678
limit of quantitation about five ppm

484
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,919
which is totally inadequate by today's

485
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,080
standards it required a high sample

486
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,960
weight about five gram

487
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,519
and

488
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,919
the accuracy was dependent

489
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,160
on the experience of the analyst so

490
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,480
someone who'd been doing it for years

491
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
would normally get a better assessment

492
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,120
than someone who just started doing it

493
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,600
so it was very subjective so it was

494
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,678
clearly um a method that needed to be

495
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,879
changed and it was quite surprising that

496
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,679
it did last one over 100 years 1908 it

497
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,520
was developed so what is the timeline to

498
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,559
adopt these changes started in 1995

499
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:04,240
the usp pharmaceutical forum identified

500
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:06,480
issues with chapter 231 in 2000 an

501
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,240
article in the journal pharmaceutical

502
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,200
and biomedical analysis

503
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
investigated icpms as an alternative

504
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,840
technique but it wasn't for another four

505
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,600
years

506
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,918
when nancy lewin and co-workers at

507
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:21,439
bristol-myers squibb came out with a

508
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,480
method a study which compared icpms

509
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,640
against chapter 231 and so showed

510
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,558
serious limitations in it and then it

511
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,559
took another 12 years

512
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,079
for the usp to get their act together

513
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,079
through various expert committees

514
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,000
working groups stakeholder meetings

515
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,359
which the acs were involved with to

516
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,599
discuss this change and then in january

517
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:45,439
2018 usp came out with chapters 2 232

518
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,839
for our element and imperius and drugs

519
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,320
and chapter

520
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:52,399
233 which was the um which was the

521
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,119
methodology used using plasma

522
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,280
spectrochemistry together with

523
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,359
microarray digestion procedures and

524
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,079
comprehensive validation protocols

525
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,319
chapter 22 32 by the way came out a

526
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,480
couple of years before that so so that

527
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,918
took a little quicker to

528
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,519
that came into

529
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,440
uh in the public domain

530
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,279
a couple of years earlier

531
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,558
as an example of the limitations of

532
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:18,720
chapter 231 use a slide in comparing

533
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:22,480
recoveries of chapter

534
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:26,000
of usp chapter 231 method against icpms

535
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,679
icpms is in red chapter 231

536
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,519
is in green

537
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,000
you can see the majority of the elements

538
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,480
by chapter 231 are less than 50 percent

539
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,440
recovery and some of them are less than

540
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,759
10 percent recovery and mercury there

541
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,919
was no recovery at all

542
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,599
mercury is a very volatile element

543
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,559
unless you're very careful with sample

544
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,719
preparation

545
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,440
you can completely lose it so that just

546
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:54,240
showed the limitations of chapter 231 so

547
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:57,519
from that point on 2018 icp ms and icp

548
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,720
oes became the standard

549
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,359
method uh the standard method to use so

550
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,839
what they did they separated out the pd

551
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,240
pde limits for pharmaceuticals only they

552
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,079
call this chapter 232 they had a

553
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,000
separate chapter for dietary supplements

554
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,000
because because that's the way they were

555
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,798
regulated in other parts of the world

556
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,480
they call this chapter 2232

557
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,119
and they implemented a totally different

558
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,319
chapter for the analytical methodology

559
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,959
which included icp oes or icp ms

560
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,200
microwave digestion and comprehensive

561
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,319
validation protocols using spike

562
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,319
recovery procedures

563
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,520
so what are the potential sources of

564
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,279
elemental impurities in drug compounds

565
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,038
this is the process they went through to

566
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,960
find out

567
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,119
what were the potential sources and what

568
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,038
was the toxicity of the elements which

569
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,319
could be found somewhere in the

570
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,240
manufacturing process so basically they

571
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,240
separated that into four different

572
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,880
categories four different groups

573
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,120
elements intentionally added as a part

574
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,360
of the manufacturing process an example

575
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,918
of that would be platinum group catalyst

576
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,879
elements in the organic synthesis of

577
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,799
many drug substances or apis

578
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,360
also elements that are not intentionally

579
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,839
added and that could be something that's

580
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,479
in a um

581
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:22,240
that's in an excipient such as talcum

582
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,640
powder which is used as a tablet

583
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,960
compression aid and talcum powder is

584
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,960
basically magnesium silicate which is

585
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,319
dug out of the ground and we know if

586
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,480
anything is mined or dug out of the

587
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:36,000
ground it can potentially contain high

588
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,519
levels of transition and heavy metals

589
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,640
the third category was elemental

590
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,639
impurities

591
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,200
that can be introduced in contact with

592
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,120
the manufacturing equipment and examples

593
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,798
of that are iron chromium and nickel

594
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,558
from stainless steel containers and

595
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,240
vessels

596
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:51,839
and finally elemental impurities that

597
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,798
could leach out of the drug substance

598
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,199
from plastic containers and closure

599
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:00,240
systems we know that some plastics are

600
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,480
dirty than others and we know that some

601
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,519
glassware is dirty than others so if it

602
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,278
was if

603
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,599
if the enclosure of the packaging system

604
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,400
was based on plastic or glass there was

605
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,639
a chance of metals leaching out of that

606
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,880
into into the product

607
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,520
the bottom line was that

608
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,480
regulators required all pharmaceutical

609
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,798
manufacturers

610
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,200
to have a comprehensive understanding of

611
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:25,278
the manufacturing process and to find

612
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,120
out where the contact points for those

613
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,359
various metals were

614
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,000
and then actually

615
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,319
and categorize those elements by their

616
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,960
toxicity classification i'll explain

617
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,960
that in a minute

618
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,400
okay so toxicity classification here's

619
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,200
chapter 232 a little bit different this

620
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,919
is now microgram okay not microgram per

621
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,558
day but this is now microgram per gram

622
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,559
in the pharmaceutical product based on

623
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,960
10 grams of maximum

624
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,960
of suggested dosage per day

625
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,440
and in the second column you'll see

626
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,000
classification well every element of

627
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,519
those 24 elemental impurities was

628
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,400
classified

629
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,798
by the toxicity classification class 1

630
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,278
class 2a class 2b

631
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,720
and class 3.

632
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,240
there were a few changes recently and

633
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,000
the ones in red are the ones that they

634
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,278
changed very recently within the past 12

635
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,440
months and this version of chapter 232

636
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:26,440
that i downloaded still had those in red

637
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,720
okay so let's look at the toxicity

638
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,840
classification basically class one were

639
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,558
elements

640
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,558
including the classic heavy metals lead

641
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,480
cadmium arsenic and mercury

642
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,038
which are human toxicants and have no

643
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,120
use in the manufactured drugs whatsoever

644
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,400
these should be monitored at all times

645
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,199
and every time

646
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,000
class 2a elements were also toxic but

647
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,919
but not as toxic as class 1

648
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,159
but but they had a high probability of

649
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,559
occurrence in the drug product and

650
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,039
should also be evaluated at all times

651
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,158
and then class 2b elements with the

652
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,640
elements which have a reduced

653
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,000
probability but should only be monitored

654
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,320
if they were present in the

655
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,480
manufacturing process example of that

656
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,639
would be the platinum group metals using

657
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,599
catalysts and the organic synthesis of

658
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,240
many drugs and class iii elements which

659
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,558
have a relatively low abundance toxicity

660
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,839
by the oral route but but would warrant

661
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:26,000
justification for

662
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:29,199
inhalation drugs and those used for

663
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,200
intravenous purposes

664
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,720
so without his background information

665
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:40,960
this is the process that usp took

666
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,720
to categorize the

667
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,120
24 elemental impurities which are

668
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:50,240
required in all pharmaceutical products

669
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:53,678
today up to 24 um but it's based on a um

670
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,599
it's based on a risk assessment approach

671
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,919
to see what what contaminants are

672
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,240
present and the likelihood of them being

673
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,038
present in the manufacturing process so

674
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,640
if we if we now take a jump into

675
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:09,679
cannabis products we can see that

676
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,919
the first area of concern is cultivation

677
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
of course and we fully understand that

678
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,200
and

679
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,278
if the plants are grown outdoors the

680
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,798
soil chemistry has to be assessed and

681
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,119
evaluated

682
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,200
so it's important to do that because we

683
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,479
know that cannabis and hemp are hyper

684
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,798
accumulators

685
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,839
of all all contaminants in the soil

686
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:32,480
whether it's heavy metals toxic elements

687
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,599
you know radionuclides so

688
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,038
we know that after chernobyl in 1986 uh

689
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:42,079
hemp was planted to clean up the

690
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,319
contaminated soil in chernobyl um

691
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,839
so we know that through anthropogenic

692
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,839
activities there's been a ton of

693
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,158
environmental pollution over the year

694
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,720
from mining from metal refineries

695
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,640
petrochemical plants coal-fired power

696
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,399
plants and there's a whole slew of

697
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,480
elements where there's compelling

698
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,479
evidence in the public domain that the

699
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,079
cannabis and hemp plants are absorbing

700
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,798
those

701
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:07,359
and we know lead in particular is is is

702
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,839
a great concern because our dependent

703
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,319
our decades of using lead-based

704
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,558
materials included leaded gasoline let

705
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,278
it paint and let it water pipes we know

706
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,918
that saul near major highways contains

707
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,440
much higher levels of lead and soil away

708
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,038
from major highways

709
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,038
we know that leaded paint can be a

710
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,640
problem i live in a house that was built

711
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,798
in 1747 before we moved in we had to get

712
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,919
a crew in to completely remove the lead

713
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:36,000
paint from the windowsills and the paint

714
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,919
on the walls and it was a major major

715
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,679
problem but we had two young children at

716
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,880
the time and

717
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,038
it was something that we were extremely

718
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,720
concerned about because lead paint was

719
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,319
used for decades

720
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,079
and then lead water pipes we saw what

721
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,038
happened in flint michigan back a few

722
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:53,759
years ago and unless you have a clean

723
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:55,519
water supply if you're using water for

724
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,558
your cannabis and hemp whatever's in the

725
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,359
water

726
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,960
will

727
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,000
clearly is a high chance it will get

728
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,159
into the cannabis product

729
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,679
fertilizers we know that fertilizers are

730
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,159
made from phosphate rock phosphates

731
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,240
fertilizers can potentially contain high

732
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,000
levels of heavy metals and transition

733
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,919
metals so we have to be really

734
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,200
particular about the quality of

735
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,679
fertilizers and nutrients that we use

736
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,798
on cannabis and hemp

737
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,399
we know

738
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,000
we know that fish emulsions fish

739
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,000
extracts are being used nowadays as

740
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,159
nutrients particularly for indoor

741
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,119
growing and

742
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,679
based on the fact that we know

743
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,678
that fish based on bioaccumulation of

744
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,360
mercury if there's mercury

745
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,000
spewing out from say a power plant and

746
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,479
it ends up in an aquatic system and the

747
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
predator the large fish

748
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,480
will have much much higher levels of

749
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,679
mercury if those fish are used for fish

750
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,480
emulsions

751
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,480
um as nutrients for indoor plants

752
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,200
there's a good chance that that mercury

753
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,200
will be transferred to the to the plant

754
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,798
and we know it's in the public domain

755
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,278
the growth enhancers are being used

756
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,879
for example nickel salts are used to

757
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,640
enhance bud size

758
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,799
and silicates are used for shoot

759
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,559
strength point i'm making is that the

760
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,519
majority of these elements would escape

761
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,200
the scrutiny of state-based regulators

762
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,720
and

763
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,798
if you don't know

764
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,319
if it's if it's if it's present there

765
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,200
you're never going to find it because

766
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,079
most states just just regulate the big

767
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,558
four

768
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,240
if it's in new york maybe michigan and

769
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,759
maybe a few other states

770
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,679
you know you might find chromium but the

771
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:35,240
majority of these elements are not being

772
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,240
regulated today

773
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,600
so the next source is extraction process

774
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,079
in the manufacturing so so this is a

775
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:48,319
potential source as well if the

776
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:51,119
if the cultivation process has

777
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,480
has given you a plant which is

778
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,839
highly contaminated or slightly

779
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,240
contaminated

780
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,839
um the extraction process

781
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,839
is not going to remove those heavy

782
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,720
metals so if it's in the flower or the

783
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:05,038
biomass there's a very high chance it

784
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,640
will be in your extracted cannabinoid

785
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,519
and we know that depending on the

786
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,240
extraction process will dictate how much

787
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,798
metal is extracted and we know again

788
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,839
it's in the public domain that

789
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,599
certainly

790
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:22,558
some solvents um depending on the flows

791
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,959
and the pressure and the temperature

792
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,480
will produce a different extract that

793
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,840
some will be more efficient some will be

794
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,440
less efficient

795
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,678
but there has to be a balance between

796
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,120
efficiency of

797
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,640
extraction

798
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,439
and

799
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,200
and taking contaminants out of the plant

800
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,320
and so there's a balance to be made

801
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,240
there and

802
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,038
it's something which i think

803
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,798
is a potential concern going forward

804
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,839
because um

805
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:52,079
maybe um efficiency of

806
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:56,158
c of the cannabinoid is probably the

807
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:58,319
major factor behind extraction and maybe

808
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,559
the you know not so concerned about the

809
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,439
elemental can or any you know any

810
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:06,240
contaminants present so i think there's

811
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,679
there's some serious concern there um

812
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,440
also the

813
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,600
either process in a grinding equipment

814
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,679
again from stainless steel chromium

815
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,119
nickel and iron i remember a case in my

816
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,919
state maryland

817
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,000
where

818
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,840
a processor was using stainless steel

819
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,480
scissors and they were found in high

820
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,398
levels finding high levels of chromium

821
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,720
in the flower and it was coming from the

822
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,759
stainless steel scissors unbelievable

823
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,240
but it was true and also finally storage

824
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,759
and delivery devices um

825
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,759
glass dropper bottles for example if

826
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,440
they made a borosilicate glass

827
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,200
okay guaranteed

828
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,600
you'll be taking heavy metals out of the

829
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,480
surface of the glass so quartz should be

830
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,879
used

831
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,200
or you know a higher purity glass but

832
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,080
definitely not borosilicate

833
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,000
so

834
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,319
if there are bonds made of glass they

835
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,440
should be made of high purity um or at

836
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,398
least made of quartz and not

837
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,240
borosilicate inks are notorious for

838
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,398
being lead-based there's lots of

839
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,440
lead-based inks out there so an example

840
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,798
recently where a study was done looking

841
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,200
at um

842
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,759
extract in a in a graduated bottle and

843
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,240
what was happening was the extract was

844
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,839
dissolving the lead-based ink and ending

845
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,240
up in the extract and they did some

846
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,720
studies over time and they they ended up

847
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,798
with some of the samples were 30 to 50

848
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,960
part per million where the regulated

849
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,839
limit for lead in that state was 0.5

850
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,679
part per billion so these things

851
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,038
these things are not fully understood

852
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,200
and um

853
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,519
things happen and uh you know before you

854
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,159
know it you have a contaminated product

855
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,558
and of course vapenz i mean i i could

856
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,080
i could spend an entire talk about vape

857
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,158
pens but basically

858
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,158
um there's a lot of stuff coming in from

859
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,720
overseas from china in particular which

860
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,760
is not high quality um

861
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,600
they contain various metallic components

862
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:55,599
and if you're vaping at temperatures

863
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,359
you're going to be

864
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,278
you know you're going to be corroding

865
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,240
the inside of those components and we

866
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:04,880
know that based on elevated

867
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,798
aerosol vaping temperatures that you're

868
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,200
not only corroding the metal from the

869
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,960
internal components but it's existing in

870
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,638
the particulate form

871
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,079
there's been work done

872
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,878
which is using scanning electron

873
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,440
microscopy microscopy and any energy

874
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,118
disperse of xrf which is showing small

875
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,599
particles of metal

876
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:27,039
in the aerosol which correlates with

877
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,039
what was in the vaping device

878
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,280
there's been a couple of

879
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,119
there's been some um sort of product

880
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,559
recalls over the past few years um

881
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,159
i kind of look for them because that's

882
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,078
what i do um

883
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,760
it's my it's my thing heavy metals to

884
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,839
understand them and um i've counted 15

885
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,399
in the past 12 months i've counted 15

886
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,838
recalls and i'm sure there are more but

887
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,838
they're the only ones that are in the

888
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,320
public domain that i found

889
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,159
and there's five of them up up on the

890
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,320
screen there

891
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,480
two were in florida one was in hawaii

892
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,760
one in maryland one in michigan two

893
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,719
involved vape pens in hawaii in maryland

894
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:12,320
in michigan involved cannabis flower and

895
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,358
in florida it involved ex cbd extracts

896
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,800
and

897
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:19,279
these are all examples of

898
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,400
limits exceeding the state-based

899
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,960
regulated

900
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,960
maximum allowable limits for a whole

901
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,559
bunch of elements and in fact the one in

902
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,280
florida is going through litigation at

903
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,279
the moment so these things happen things

904
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,079
are getting into the public domain

905
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,359
um

906
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,760
which are

907
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,639
you know which are unsafe and

908
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,119
it's uh it's interesting to see um

909
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,960
whether if if the regulations were

910
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,680
tighter whether that would be the case

911
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,280
but

912
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,519
you know they are happening so let me

913
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,599
give you my final thoughts on regulating

914
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,599
heavy metals in cannabis consumer

915
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,079
products the current list of four heavy

916
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,079
metals is clearly inadequate absolutely

917
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,160
inadequate i'm not saying the 24

918
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,680
regulated by the pharmaceutical industry

919
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,920
that might be a little

920
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,679
um of an overkill

921
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,880
but i can tell you that elements

922
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,279
contaminants derived from the

923
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,358
cultivation manufacturing

924
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,599
storage delivery process would warrant

925
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,880
at least another 10 elements on top of

926
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,440
the big four

927
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,358
so i think a future list of elemental

928
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,519
contaminants in cannabis worthy of

929
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,679
consideration again i say worthy of

930
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,079
consideration we need to do a risk

931
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,679
assessment study of which ones are

932
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,440
actually in

933
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,329
in in the in the cultivation

934
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,720
manufacturing process um

935
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,759
[Music]

936
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,639
but

937
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,960
i'm i'm saying that at least

938
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,279
a list of 15 elements based on the big

939
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,400
four plus the additional elements in

940
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
maryland

941
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,519
um

942
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,640
michigan and new york plus international

943
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,599
six

944
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,199
from com

945
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,720
from compelling evidence in the public

946
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,480
domain

947
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,879
and the bottom line is these most of

948
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,838
these would escape the scrutiny of state

949
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,838
regulations

950
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,440
okay so um

951
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,070
the signs that the industry is moving

952
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,000
towards an extended panel

953
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,599
[Music]

954
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,440
i mean three examples here nist is

955
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,280
coming out with a certified reference

956
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,280
material for nist

957
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,599
for six 13 toxic elements in hemp this

958
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,440
is a certified reference material which

959
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,280
we which will be available this time

960
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,800
this year sometime i don't know exactly

961
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,320
know when

962
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,800
but interestingly enough the list is

963
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,119
there and includes uranium and i've seen

964
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,760
early nist data which shows there's

965
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,760
about half a ppm

966
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,559
in a hemp standard

967
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:45,440
i sit on an astm d37 committee we're

968
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:47,519
writing a method for icpms for cannabis

969
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,679
and hemp consumer products and we

970
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,679
include 23 elements

971
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,919
elemental contaminants

972
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,559
and finally usp has just published a

973
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,880
draft monograph for cbd for use as an

974
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:02,480
api so this is this is only for use as

975
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,640
an api in drugs like epidiolex or drugs

976
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,639
that are going through the approval

977
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,598
pipeline by the fda

978
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:12,400
and to comply with that you have to show

979
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,359
compliance for up to 24 elemental

980
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,838
contaminants so i believe the cbd market

981
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:20,159
will separate out into the really pure

982
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,559
stuff really clean stuff that's used as

983
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,719
an api for pharmaceuticals and then the

984
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,960
rest of the stuff which is probably you

985
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:30,598
know 95 percent at the moment will be

986
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,599
used for other purposes

987
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,400
uh so i'd like to finish with a source

988
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,000
of information from my talk i've written

989
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,079
three textbooks

990
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,719
in this domain on the applications and

991
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,039
the fundamentals of icpms first one is a

992
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,759
practical guide to icpms which came out

993
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:50,159
in 2015 the second one was measuring

994
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,320
elemental impurities in pharmaceuticals

995
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,480
which came out in 2018

996
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,920
and my final one i've written they just

997
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,119
came out with a paperback version of

998
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,358
that is measuring heavy metal

999
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,960
contaminants in cannabis and hemp and

1000
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,039
that's the one in the middle they're all

1001
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,639
available on amazon or through

1002
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,039
my publishers

1003
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,879
and um hot off the press i had an

1004
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,920
article published in analytical cannabis

1005
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,280
today it's a four-part series

1006
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,039
on

1007
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,320
the benefits of carrying out the

1008
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,838
comprehensive risk assessment study

1009
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,838
to better understand elemental

1010
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,358
impurities in cannabis and drug products

1011
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,519
and that will be published over the next

1012
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:28,519
few weeks

1013
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,719
with that i thank you for your time um i

1014
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,480
think i've gone over but i think we

1015
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,118
started late um

1016
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,838
thanks for your time and i'll gladly um

1017
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,838
answer any of your questions

1018
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,200
thanks a lot for the presentation very

1019
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,480
very nice talk i really learned a lot

1020
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,919
from you today uh i i have uh i

1021
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,480
basically want to ask the same question

1022
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,079
that asked to the peer speaker who was

1023
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,800
talking about uh pediatric use uh

1024
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,839
i was wondering now with with the

1025
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,599
uh

1026
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,279
right now we have the regulation at

1027
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,160
different stage you know many of them

1028
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,280
focus on the back four yeah and then all

1029
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,920
of them

1030
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,519
are there's no difference between

1031
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,480
uh recreational and medical cannabis now

1032
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,559
even it's for people who are sick

1033
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,240
i guess i'm just i just want to you know

1034
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,279
i think your thought on

1035
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:42,078
should there be a difference between the

1036
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,240
regulation for the medical for for the

1037
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,119
you know toxic element regulation for

1038
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,879
medical versus uh recreational chemicals

1039
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,559
given that you know of course we do not

1040
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,400
right now the information is so scary we

1041
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,519
don't really know what is out there

1042
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,760
but

1043
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,759
you know like for the patient

1044
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,280
it should there be a difference and if

1045
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,680
that should then how should we proceed

1046
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,680
to there

1047
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,200
yeah i mean

1048
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,358
i would say that

1049
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:12,078
i mean my state for example maryland

1050
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,559
only okay currently only allows

1051
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,560
medicinal cannabis use but they will

1052
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,318
they will be approving recreational use

1053
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,799
next year and they're concerned that

1054
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,880
bringing in recreational use will affect

1055
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,079
the quality and the purity of the

1056
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,760
medicinal

1057
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,960
drugs so

1058
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,200
i think

1059
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,880
you know based on the fact that i've

1060
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,919
done a lot of work in the pharmaceutical

1061
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,880
industry

1062
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,480
which is highly regulated and

1063
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,200
you know clearly the pharmaceutical

1064
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,679
industry was very concerned

1065
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,639
about producing products which

1066
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:46,719
potentially could contain heavy metals

1067
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,039
which they weren't even monitoring so

1068
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,358
even though it took them 20 years

1069
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,719
clearly they saw a need to do that but

1070
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:57,119
not only a need to do it they needed to

1071
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,598
comprehensively understand

1072
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,240
where the contact points for the heavy

1073
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,280
metals were in the entire manufacturing

1074
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,439
process

1075
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,599
and now every manufacture every

1076
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,800
pharmaceutical manufacturer has to show

1077
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,440
compliance for up to 24 elemental

1078
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,760
impurities you know based on the method

1079
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,679
of delivery so i've come from that kind

1080
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,319
of background and i've come into the

1081
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:23,118
cannabis industry and i see an industry

1082
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:26,239
which is chaotic it's exciting but it's

1083
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,559
so fractured and disjointed and

1084
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,358
you know when you see that recreational

1085
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,679
use cannabis has exactly the same limits

1086
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,559
as medicinal use to me it doesn't it

1087
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,799
doesn't make any sense

1088
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,039
i mean for example

1089
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,720
i i'm i'm working with a group at the

1090
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,880
moment that's um

1091
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,239
that they suffer from adult epilepsy and

1092
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,000
they found

1093
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:51,519
and and they found relief in vaping cbg

1094
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,960
and um

1095
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,639
okay they approached me because they

1096
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,880
were concerned they read

1097
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,719
in the open literature that these vaping

1098
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,800
devices were

1099
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:03,118
showing high levels of elemental

1100
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,960
contaminants in the aerosol which would

1101
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,039
not be unregulated

1102
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,838
based on based on the metallic

1103
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,440
components within these vaping devices

1104
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:14,239
so even though

1105
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,599
they tried conventional drugs for their

1106
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:17,919
seizures

1107
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,640
and they were found in relief in this

1108
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,318
cbg in particular

1109
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,598
they were extremely concerned and i'm

1110
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,639
helping them

1111
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,680
maybe find a source of these vaping

1112
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:32,960
devices which are cleaner which are less

1113
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:36,799
contaminated i mean i see that i see i

1114
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,800
see now there being these vaping devices

1115
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,400
you know separating up into the ones

1116
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,599
which are used for the masses which are

1117
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,160
coming in

1118
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,599
in the millions from china and ones

1119
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,159
which are going to be used for medical

1120
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,160
purposes

1121
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,960
you cannot use the ones coming in from

1122
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,879
china because i've seen some i've seen

1123
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,039
some data which is scary

1124
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,480
and to give someone who's taking cbg for

1125
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,679
a seizure

1126
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,000
and

1127
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,838
the cbg is relieving their symptoms but

1128
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
they put in particulates of chromium

1129
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:10,480
down their lungs i mean to me that's so

1130
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,480
scary

1131
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:12,799
you know

1132
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,039
i'm

1133
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,079
i guess i've been inverse immersed in

1134
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:20,318
this area for the past three years and i

1135
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,800
see the mistakes the industry is making

1136
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:24,559
and i'm trying to help them get better

1137
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,880
it's very frustrating

1138
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,599
but working with groups like astm and

1139
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,480
aoac i think we're making some headway

1140
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,920
but

1141
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,199
there's a lot of stuff going on which

1142
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,200
needs to change

1143
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,199
absolutely

1144
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,440
um regarding the vaporizers i believe in

1145
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,358
2019 there was a presentation here

1146
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,240
where they went into a lot of detail on

1147
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:50,960
the elemental testing of the vape

1148
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,399
the vapor coming out it seemed to come

1149
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,000
to a different conclusion i think they

1150
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,440
said it was fairly low

1151
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,960
so i was just curious if you had any

1152
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,280
insights why that was different okay

1153
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,838
you're not talking about the um the uh

1154
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,480
the valley scare in 200 2019 with

1155
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:06,480
vitamin e acetate to you

1156
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,519
i believe they were looking at metals

1157
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,000
the presentation here in 2019 on on no

1158
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:14,318
okay so that was the valley scare where

1159
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
the okay vitamin e acetate was getting

1160
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:19,440
into consumers lungs

1161
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,358
and um killed about 70 people um yeah

1162
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,079
there's there's been a lot of work done

1163
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:25,759
over the past few years in

1164
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:28,160
characterizing vaping our aerosol for

1165
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,480
elemental contaminants unfortunately

1166
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:34,000
there is no standard method out there it

1167
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,358
is a very complex analysis um you're

1168
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,880
dealing with

1169
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,400
you okay you're dealing with diluents

1170
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,160
you're dealing with cannabinoids you're

1171
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,079
dealing with hydrophobic and hydrophilic

1172
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:44,639
liquids how do you

1173
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,720
take the aerosol

1174
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,078
and allow it to make a condensate and

1175
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,719
take a representative part of that

1176
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,318
condensate and introduce it into your

1177
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:55,358
analytical technique which is typically

1178
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:57,838
icp ms how can you be sure you're taking

1179
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:00,239
a representative um

1180
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,480
a representative sample from the tank

1181
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,799
because at different temperatures the

1182
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,760
elemental contaminants have different

1183
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,760
um

1184
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,800
have different vaporization temperatures

1185
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,040
so based on the vaporization temperature

1186
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,560
some of the less volatile elements you

1187
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,318
know might not come over and some of the

1188
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,400
more volatile elements will come over

1189
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,719
first so how do you know what your

1190
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,760
sampling is representative what's in the

1191
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,598
tank it's a very complex analysis and

1192
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,760
there's no standardized method some

1193
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,160
states are trying to do it colorado is

1194
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,560
leading the charge but i know they're

1195
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,239
having some challenges and

1196
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,799
you can't give this analysis to a

1197
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,479
regular testing lab it's just too it's

1198
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,318
difficult for someone

1199
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,559
who's had years of experience in trace

1200
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,719
element analysis um

1201
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,519
virtually impossible

1202
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,358
okay i'm okay i'm not critiquing

1203
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,119
the the testing labs because there's

1204
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,598
some really good ones out there but this

1205
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,680
analysis is so difficult so challenging

1206
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,079
and you have to throw in you have to you

1207
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,519
also have to throw in a smoke machine

1208
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,240
and how do you know

1209
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:04,400
that the tough profile of a cannabis

1210
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,959
consumer is very similar to an

1211
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,079
e-cigarette user or a nicotine user

1212
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,679
they're not you know they're not

1213
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,200
different so all the work that's been

1214
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,598
done up to now has been done on

1215
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,919
e-cigarettes nicotine devices and all of

1216
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,160
a sudden you're then going to a cannabis

1217
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,838
device and a cannabis vapor has a

1218
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:20,639
different profile

1219
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,960
this

1220
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,519
this is so complicated and so difficult

1221
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,800
that it's i think it'll be challenging

1222
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:30,679
sorry

1223
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,680
okay thanks for your time
