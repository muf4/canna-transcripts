variables that affect how well cannabis

following topics

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,620
what should consumers and patients be

77
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,018
looking at when choosing Vape products

78
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,658
the symbiotic relationship between

79
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,060
cannabis oil and vape Hardware

80
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:24,000
why emissions testing is important to

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,400
understand what the user is inhaling

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,500
the vast difference of aerosolization

83
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,080
rates for cannabinoids

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,000

cannabis Vape regulations and

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,919

good afternoon Arno thank you for

113
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,359
joining me on the podcast

114
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:52,918
thank you very much for having me so

115
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,139
it's a pleasure always happy to

116
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,939
contribute to the can Med community

117
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,879
awesome and I'm excited to talk with you

118
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:02,399
today about vaping your presentation at

119
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,379
camid23 had a lot of really interesting

120
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,939
points that I know you really weren't

121
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,339
able to dive into due to time

122
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,600
restrictions but here we are today and

123
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,719
hoping we can get into it in a little

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,540
bit more detail but maybe before we

125
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,940
start I wanted to ask you about patients

126
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,680
who Vape their medicine because you

127
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,379
mentioned patients throughout the

128
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,139
presentation and I'll be honest when I

129
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,360
speak with doctors on the podcast they

130
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,418
don't typically mention vaping as their

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,639
you know preferred delivery method so do

132
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,918
you have a sense of what percentage of

133
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,139
patients Vape their medicine

134
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,719
well if if you look at the percentage of

135
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:43,199
sales you got roughly 30 percent of uh

136
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,720
of cannabis consumers use Vape now

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,340
when you look at the regulatory schemes

138
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,199
in different states

139
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:52,739
um New York for instance where I'm

140
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,060
headquartered uh was a solely vaping

141
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,220
State

142
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,339
um until until roughly three to four

143
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,740
years ago where uh they started allowing

144
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,839
other forms in the medical program other

145
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,300
forms of of use

146
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:09,418
I think one of the main reasons

147
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,319
um that was the case is because when you

148
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:16,319
create extracts you control more what's

149
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,779
inside so therefore you control more

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,839
what comes out of it and you have a

151
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:24,538
better granularity in terms of effects

152
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,000
based medicine I really believe

153
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:30,418
historically that's why some of these

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,918
states only allowed Vape now we also

155
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,899
have the example of other states that

156
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,959
don't allow Vapor provinces like Quebec

157
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:40,079
and Canada does not allow Vapes because

158
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,818
of of The Vape scare and um the

159
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,019
conflicting information with nicotine

160
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,220
vaping

161
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,038
um but it's still something I don't

162
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,780
understand to this day nicotine vaping

163
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,759
is a wonderful harm reduction tool

164
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,219
you've got countries in Europe that

165
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,500
reimburse

166
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:58,139
that reimburse users that switch from

167
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,600
smoking to vaping a certain amount every

168
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,519
year to buy new vaping gear I think it's

169
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,300
only really North America where vaping

170
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,299
is chastised

171
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,019
so

172
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm assuming and it was very clear when

173
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,279
watching the video of your presentation

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,779
that you know not all Vape carts are

175
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,619
equal

176
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,959
um there are a number of different

177
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,879
variables that kind of go into you know

178
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,399
how many how much cannabinoids are being

179
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,279
delivered to the consumer or even the

180
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:28,379
quality of it so what should consumers

181
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,579
or patients be paying attention to when

182
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,019
they're when they're choosing a vape

183
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,240
cart

184
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:36,538
I think the most important thing to

185
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,139
understand when you're using a vaping

186
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:43,978
product is the transparency that the

187
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,680
producer is offering are there coas is

188
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:49,258
the brand of the manufacturer of that

189
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,139
Vape cart present is there a serial

190
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,900
number on The Vape cartridge usually

191
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,439
underneath is it a unique serial number

192
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:01,679
is there um is there any testing that's

193
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,219
provided on the raw materials of that

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,139
cartridge itself for instance the glass

195
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,620
outside

196
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:12,660
or the center post or the mouthpiece

197
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,740
what kind of testing has been done on

198
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,319
that and as a consumer as a patient what

199
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,060
kind of testing do I have access to to

200
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,560
evaluate if this product is good for me

201
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,598
or not

202
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,180
yeah and I guess I'll put that question

203
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,399
back on to you so how immediately

204
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,199
apparent is it when I mean I know from

205
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,199
my experience if I go to a dispensary

206
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,300
and I'm looking at a vape cart I mean

207
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,919
I until I saw your presentation I didn't

208
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,978
even know I needed to look or that I

209
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:44,399
should but is it is it easy to see on

210
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,620
the packaging to to know kind of what

211
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,559
sort of Hardware is being used

212
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,159
it it depends it depends really on what

213
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:55,439
packaging it depends on which brand some

214
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,019
Brands really embrace the fact that

215
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,240
they're working with reputable hardware

216
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:02,159
and uh and and and are willing to talk

217
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,159
about it some others just put a

218
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,980
cartridge in uh in in a mini exit bag

219
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,679
and don't put any more info that doesn't

220
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,200
mean that the product isn't good but

221
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:17,159
um what what what you need to understand

222
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,560
is that the cartridge itself uh out of

223
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,439
uh maybe what a sixty dollar a sixty

224
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,679
dollar Vape device uh the cartridge

225
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,540
itself is anywhere between two and three

226
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,319
dollars the cost the rest is really the

227
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:33,299
cost of the oil so oftentimes the

228
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,740
cartridge is considered more of a

229
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,240
commodity

230
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,820
um but when you really look at the

231
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,180
science of it it can't be considered a

232
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,060
commodity because the hardware and the

233
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:48,419
oil is totally different there is a

234
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:50,338
symbiotic relay relationship between the

235
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:53,159
two but you can't test one and not the

236
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:56,100
other and vice versa you can have the

237
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,838
best oil that has ever been created with

238
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,740
the best effects the more consistent

239
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,779
flavors if it's in a bad device it'll be

240
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,639
a bad experience for the consumer and

241
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:08,759
vice versa if you've got the best device

242
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,860
and you put a distillate that's cut with

243
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,559
loads of products you're going to have a

244
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,680
bad consumer experience as well so you

245
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:20,278
really have to work with reputable

246
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:22,139
Brands and uh and ask questions as a

247
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,480
patient as a consumer ask questions to

248
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:28,559
the bud Thunder as the bud tender been

249
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,259
educated by the brand has uh or do they

250
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,299
have handouts available on what is the

251
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:35,700
best temperature to use the device at or

252
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:38,219
what is the best voltage on the battery

253
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,160
that comes with it it's really really

254
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,040
important and I think that's also one of

255
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:47,699
the reasons why we saw an uptick

256
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:51,419
starting last year in sales of

257
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,640
disposable Vapes because as much as it's

258
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:57,000
not really sustainable unless you're

259
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,120
working with a recycled recyclable Vape

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,120
um we we can control the user experience

261
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,240
a lot better and avoid a lot of those

262
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,679
um end user or patient mistakes of

263
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,079
plugging a cartridge into a battery

264
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,838
that's not made for that cartridge

265
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,338
um just by the prevalence of uh of uh of

266
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,079
disposables

267
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,519
um has really increased over the past

268
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,099
year and a half now

269
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,959
wow so it's not primarily just a

270
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,000
convenience thing it's

271
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,879
that the producer can actually control

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,820
the experience a bit more exactly and

273
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,159
that's what we have a hard time

274
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,320
explaining to our clients uh at the

275
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,659
blink group is really guys you can't

276
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,600
just buy any cartridge off the market

277
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:43,019
because a lot of the companies

278
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,420
um in uh in in more traditional markets

279
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:48,299
like California like Colorado will go

280
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:51,299
online on Alibaba dhgate and say oh look

281
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:52,759
I can buy a cartridge for 75 cents and

282
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:55,139
really don't care about what's inside

283
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:56,939
where what's inside is going to

284
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,578
influence the consumer experience so

285
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,660
it's really really important that that

286
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:05,879
companies uh Brands msos really

287
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:08,399
understand the importance of the

288
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,899
hardware and don't solely choose on

289
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,759
price

290
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,620
right and I love this idea of the

291
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,399
symbiotic relationship between the oil

292
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:19,820
and the hardware and is it a case too

293
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,980
where you might have different Hardware

294
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,720
requirements for different types of oils

295
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,180
oh definitely

296
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,339
um there's there's different oils have

297
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:32,939
different viscosities A good rule of

298
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:35,880
thumb is that distillate is is is pretty

299
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,339
viscous uh in terms of CPS where we're

300
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,000
looking at anywhere between 50 and and

301
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:46,019
100 000 CPS

302
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,820
and when you sorry what's CPS centipoise

303
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,620
it's the measure of a viscosity of a

304
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,760
fluid got it

305
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:56,159
um and when we are looking at live resin

306
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,919
we're usually on some lower viscosities

307
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,539
because we've got some either recombined

308
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,000
terpenes in there or the terpenes have

309
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:06,059
been re-added back so we're on a product

310
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,179
that's a little bit more liquidy and

311
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:12,299
then when we look at live rosin which is

312
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:17,099
solventless which is pressed uh we go

313
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:20,338
back to something very very thick so the

314
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,420
the mathematical process of vaporization

315
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:26,519
is a mix of chemistry

316
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:28,379
thermodynamics and fluid mechanics

317
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,419
so you have to understand all three of

318
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,480
those to understand which Hardware can

319
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:36,120
work better with which oil the added

320
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,659
complexity of cannabis is that it is a

321
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,000
plant it's a natural product so from one

322
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:45,000
batch to the other of the exact same

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,940
strain when you process it you will have

324
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,179
different inputs so the trick is really

325
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,820
to figure out which Hardware suits which

326
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:57,539
oil the best we have we have a great

327
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:00,540
rule of thumb that are are uh our

328
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:01,919
run-of-the-mill basic cartridge the V12

329
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,099
is something that would work very well

330
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,500
with distillate and live resin for rosin

331
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,180
because you have more of that full

332
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,578
flavor because you have more of that

333
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:14,458
terpenes we need to use a different

334
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:18,778
device to make sure the client or the

335
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:22,078
patient does not heat it too much so we

336
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:24,958
increase the resistance for instance to

337
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:27,179
be usable on the run-of-the-mill

338
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,638
batteries that you'd be buying

339
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:32,519
um now that's just an example we can

340
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,519
also look at the intake hole size

341
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,919
because that will measure the rate at

342
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,679
which the oil is going to feed the coil

343
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,019
to turn into vapor so obviously the

344
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:46,039
thicker the oil the bigger holes you

345
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:48,539
need to allow more of that to seep in

346
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,519
there's there's a lot more I'm trying to

347
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,278
hit it really high level but there's a

348
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:56,578
lot more that goes uh that goes into

349
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:59,159
this and really the the the performance

350
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:01,319
of The Vape cartridges on the market can

351
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,179
literally be divided by 10 or multiplied

352
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,899
by 10 by changing one of those variables

353
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:08,338
right and given that that fact and that

354
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,198
you were saying you know some processors

355
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,779
they're just buying kind of cheap

356
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,419
Hardware from Alibaba

357
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,698
um I imagine that the performance and

358
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:20,399
quality of Vape carts in the marketplace

359
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:21,620
can vary widely

360
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,259
true

361
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:28,019
immensely we've done some testing

362
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:31,559
um with different viscosities so let's

363
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:33,360
say you take a very very thick liquid

364
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,559
you know like like like honey like

365
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,278
molasses

366
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:43,739
if you use a battery for instance at a

367
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:46,139
3.7 volt setting with smaller intake

368
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,759
holes you're essentially not going to

369
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:52,740
allow enough oil to penetrate the coil

370
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,198
um fast enough when the coil is heating

371
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,820
up so basically the little that has made

372
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,399
it into the coil is going to be burning

373
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:02,879
immediately and not only are you getting

374
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:06,299
bad flavor but you're also getting toxic

375
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,639
emissions because burning in essence is

376
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,319
the same thing as combustion so you're

377
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,480
degrading the terpenes and the

378
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,699
cannabinoids in there and uh potentially

379
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,560
ruining the The Experience now on the

380
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,120
other hand if you have too much oil that

381
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,759
goes in

382
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,578
um it and and too much of an intake hole

383
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,220
and too much of a big porosity on the

384
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:32,759
ceramic itself of the coil you are going

385
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:35,100
to see saturation which means which

386
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,899
leads to clogging which means leads to

387
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,139
leaking and potential spit back through

388
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:43,500
the mouthpiece so it is very very

389
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:47,220
important to really match the hardware

390
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,379
to the oil or vice versa and make sure

391
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,019
you have a consistent Supply I think

392
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:55,139
that's really the other the other side

393
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:57,600
to this is the consistency of the

394
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:00,000
quality of the product

395
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,920
yeah and that maybe brings up a good

396
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,519
point too and it's probably difficult to

397
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,558
do in an audio medium but as best you

398
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,058
can and if you have any visuals that you

399
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,160
can maybe send over I can put it in the

400
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:14,519
show description you kind of describe

401
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,319
how the mechanism actually works like

402
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,318
how does the oil get into the the

403
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,879
chamber to the coil I I'll I'll be first

404
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,318
to admit maybe I don't fully understand

405
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
it either so it'd be interesting if you

406
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:27,298
give us like kind of a high level of how

407
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,460
the mechanism works so basically you

408
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:32,339
have the tank where you that that's

409
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,558
filled by the processor fills the oil

410
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:36,959
into that tank

411
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,000
um on a basic cartridge you have a

412
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,240
center post and that Center Post has

413
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,279
holes with a certain aperture that let

414
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,798
that oil penetrate into the absorption

415
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:51,259
material which in most of the cases is

416
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,839
ceramic

417
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:59,058
that absorption material is then heated

418
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:01,859
with a coil and the oil that's in there

419
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:04,200
evaporates so we say it's vapor it's not

420
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:06,719
really Vapor it's called aerosol in

421
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,759
scientific terms turns into aerosol so

422
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,279
very little particles that come up

423
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:12,960
through that chimney of the center post

424
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:15,240
and that the patient actually inhales

425
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,759
afterwards so

426
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,759
as you can easily imagine the

427
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:23,339
characteristics of the hardware will

428
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,160
Define the size of those particles and

429
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:29,519
we'll design the cop the sorry decide

430
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,259
the composition of those particles based

431
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,240
on different temperature settings how

432
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:34,740
long it was heated when was the last

433
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,179
time it was heated has it had time to

434
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,700
cool down

435
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:42,980
um and uh and really a lot of uh a lot

436
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,980
of other uh of a lot of other variables

437
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:48,000
definitely and I did want to ask you

438
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,439
about about testing and about

439
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,779
regulations because it's something you

440
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,820
brought up in in the presentation and

441
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,440
one of the things that you that you

442
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,319
mentioned is that all the testing

443
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,179
regulations are right now all the

444
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,519
testing is being performed on the oil

445
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,080
that's going into the cartridge and not

446
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,038
on the emissions that are coming out of

447
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,359
it do I have that correct exactly

448
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:12,419
basically Colorado is the only state

449
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,859
that has um that has set up emissions

450
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,820
testing

451
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,459
um

452
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:19,859
we've been a big part of that and and we

453
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,480
really want that to be used everywhere

454
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:25,859
think about it this way

455
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,960
when you test a product for its uh its

456
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:31,579
safety you want to test the product that

457
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,220
the consumer is actually using right

458
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:37,859
well right now we are testing the oil

459
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,220
that's inside a cartridge but that oil

460
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:44,339
changes state it's the same thing as if

461
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:48,120
you you would decide to uh test the

462
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:49,740
water in uh in your in your boiler and

463
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,359
not instead of testing the vapor that

464
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,500
people are going to be inhaling

465
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:57,178
so from a safety standpoint from a

466
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,859
consumer standpoint it makes way more

467
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,440
sense to be testing the vapor that comes

468
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:04,379
out of it again because there is a

469
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,820
change of state it turns into an aerosol

470
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,640
from a liquid

471
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,980
so uh that's really why we strongly

472
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,200
believe in pushing emissions testing and

473
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,819
a lot of the performance testing we do

474
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,538
on our devices

475
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:17,579
um

476
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:20,000
have the end goal in mind which is to

477
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:23,159
provide a consistent user experience

478
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,140
from start to finish of that device

479
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,840
whether it's a cartridge whether it's a

480
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,840
pod system whether it's an all-in-one

481
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,538
disposable our end goal is really to

482
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:37,199
provide that consistent delivery of

483
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:39,058
those cannabinoids and as we talk about

484
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,500
cannabinoids that's really what makes

485
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:48,058
this exercise difficult all cannabinoids

486
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,038
have different points of aerosolization

487
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:52,740
um we'll have CBN for instance if you

488
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,839
have CBN in a vape they're usually using

489
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,019
gummies to help with sleep

490
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:00,119
but if they're using Vapes in a regular

491
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,639
cartridge usually when you're done with

492
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:07,879
50 of your cartridge the CBN is

493
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:11,340
completely uh Gone completely degraded

494
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,140
and another effect that we've seen with

495
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:14,939
most of the cartridges on the market

496
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:19,259
because obviously we don't test just our

497
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:23,038
own is the fact that thca

498
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:27,538
um and uh and and uh and and various

499
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:30,000
other cannabinoids actually increase in

500
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:33,119
availability in the vapor throughout the

501
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,159
lifespan of the cartridge because those

502
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,639
are basically the only ones left at the

503
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:40,620
end terpenes have a lower boiling point

504
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,820
and when you're using a live resin at

505
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:43,139
the end of the cartridge you're not

506
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:44,339
going to get a lot of that flavor you're

507
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,179
really just going to get the high that's

508
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:51,079
left in it interesting so you said that

509
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:53,820
CBN when the cart is at basically 50

510
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,740
it's it's all gone

511
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:58,259
on on the majority of the cards that

512
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,038
we've tested yes wow there is no

513
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:05,579
consistency in the in in the delivery

514
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:08,579
and mind you it's not only because of uh

515
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:10,798
of bad product it's also because as as

516
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,240
an industry we just haven't done a lot

517
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,700
of research we don't have a lot of

518
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,319
information on how to better preserve

519
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,840
these cannabinoids and these terpenes

520
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,460
and these flavonoids so we are able to

521
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,199
provide a consistent delivery throughout

522
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,880
the entire experience

523
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,220
so of the cannabinoids that you've

524
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,299
tested which one is sort of the most

525
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,940
consistent throughout the life of a card

526
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,679
I would say THC and CBD are the most

527
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,440
consistent but

528
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:40,500
the answer is a little bit cute a little

529
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,140
bit skewed the big caveat here is that

530
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,099
those are the two primary cannabinoids

531
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,780
that are the most used so I think as the

532
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,459
industry progresses and as the research

533
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:52,980
progresses we're going to be able to

534
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,058
find more cannabinoids that can

535
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,339
basically provide I would say the same

536
00:22:56,058 --> 00:23:00,658
effects but also be more consistent in

537
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:02,339
the delivery

538
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,320
right and so would that have to do with

539
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,599
kind of tweaking temperatures and and

540
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,879
different things like that exactly it's

541
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:11,399
really about the extraction techniques

542
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,340
the ratios the um you know we hear a lot

543
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,080
about the Entourage effect uh but what

544
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:18,119
the what we don't hear a lot about is

545
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,359
the Entourage effect of different

546
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:23,819
cannabinoids with different terpenes

547
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:27,000
also modifies the physical properties of

548
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:29,460
the the concentrate it can make it less

549
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,759
viscous more viscous and that has an

550
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,840
influence on uh on uh on on the vapor

551
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,940
that comes out

552
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,399
and another thing that you mentioned in

553
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,038
your presentation too was adding

554
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,019
additional terpenes too can affect I

555
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,058
think you mentioned either was the pH or

556
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:46,980
the viscosity I can't quite remember but

557
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:51,960
but that is a consideration as well

558
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:54,360
exactly the um the the the pH is

559
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,460
basically the acidity of your of your

560
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,139
products on uh on the majority of

561
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,519
distillates we're looking at a pH of

562
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,580
four

563
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:05,460
um if you add a couple more terpenes in

564
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:07,319
there which are more acidic they are

565
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,600
going to have a lower pH so we're going

566
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:12,178
to end up maybe at three

567
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:16,019
um and uh once we get into those very

568
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:19,080
acidic uh products is when you start

569
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:22,379
hearing about leeching and leaching is

570
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:25,439
basically the acidic nature of the

571
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,440
concentrate that will be eating away at

572
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,659
the hardware and extracting that's why

573
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,058
you call it in uh in in science

574
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:35,340
leachables and extractables it's

575
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:38,158
basically going to extract out of for

576
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,439
instance the center post if there is any

577
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,080
kind of lead it might extract the lead

578
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,360
out of that Center Post and and uh and

579
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:47,639
that lead will end up in the oil thus in

580
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:51,000
the aerosol

581
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,919
so another reason why emissions testing

582
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,140
it would be better than testing the oil

583
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,840
that's going in exactly because

584
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,538
emissions is what goes into our lungs

585
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,519
excellent and so from a Testing Lab

586
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:04,740
perspective

587
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,720
um how much more onerous or difficult is

588
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,819
it to be doing emission testing rather

589
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,679
than on oils

590
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:12,658
well the oil testing has to be done

591
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,640
because the oil is probably used for uh

592
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:18,179
for other applications as well sure

593
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,038
that's a given emissions testing I think

594
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,320
the biggest from a lab perspective the

595
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:24,658
biggest the biggest issue is investment

596
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:27,119
in the proper uh the proper tooling to

597
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:31,200
do that you need to get vaping machines

598
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:33,839
uh you need to be able to uh trap the

599
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,900
aerosol that comes out and then analyze

600
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,720
it but once it's done technically

601
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,778
emissions testing should be I would say

602
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,120
as cheap as regular oil testing

603
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:47,099
excellent okay because the methods once

604
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,259
you've extracted

605
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,058
um the the components of the aerosol the

606
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,220
methods are the same for the as with the

607
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:55,859
oil for testing so the methods are there

608
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,558
the the uh the material and the tooling

609
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:59,639
is already there to do those tests

610
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,579
okay

611
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,380
and you also mentioned that you know

612
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,658
we're hoping that Federal legalization

613
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,059
it's on the horizon eventually and when

614
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:11,460
that happens it's going to bring FDA

615
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:12,298
requirements and regulations

616
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,140
um

617
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:18,000
so what do you anticipate those regs

618
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,720
might look like and how different would

619
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,940
they be from what's required now

620
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,880
so I think

621
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,880
whether it's the FDA or anything uh or

622
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,919
or any other government body

623
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,120
obviously when when this goes federally

624
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,179
legal there's going to have to be some

625
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,278
safeguards in place and if we want to

626
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:42,659
look at for instance the nicotine vaping

627
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:44,700
industry emissions testing was mandatory

628
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,980
um there's something called the pmta

629
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,980
process the pre-market authorization

630
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,980
approval

631
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,558
that has three different parts it has

632
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,058
one part

633
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,220
clinical trials one part emissions

634
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:01,619
research one part really literature

635
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,440
research on all the products and the

636
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:06,778
flavors that are included in Vapes if we

637
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,940
want to take any lessons from that I

638
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:10,558
strongly believe that when the federal

639
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,100
government steps in

640
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:16,500
those kind of uh of testing Cycles are

641
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:20,298
going to be required and bear in mind

642
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:24,900
the pmta Cycles are in nine triplicates

643
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:27,720
so imagine 250 dollars per triplicate

644
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,000
you got to multiply that by nine

645
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,620
um and then you gotta work out the

646
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,480
consistency of the product because again

647
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:35,038
this is a natural product so from batch

648
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,798
to batch you're going to have to be

649
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,200
doing that I believe that when the

650
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:42,240
federal government steps in if companies

651
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,940
are not ready and have not future

652
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,579
proofed their their go to market

653
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:50,058
strategy and their testing strategy it's

654
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:53,038
going to be a wild surprise out there

655
00:27:50,058 --> 00:27:55,740
the reprieve here is that it took them

656
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:59,278
four to five years for nicotine vaping

657
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,819
to create all of that so there might be

658
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,259
a moratorium for four to five years but

659
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:05,639
it's still it's still really a heavy

660
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:07,259
workload and I really urge all

661
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,140
processors to start looking into this

662
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:14,158
right now and understanding what those

663
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,900
require governments might be and uh

664
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,400
starting to set up any kind of testing

665
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,179
or research that needs to be done right

666
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,340
now yeah so with those requirements on

667
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,778
consistency and things like that would

668
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:26,639
that

669
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:28,500
would that limit the type of products

670
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,240
that would be available

671
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,000
um for cannabis I mean I imagine like

672
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,980
sort of like whether it's live resin or

673
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,019
live rosin kind of these more whole

674
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,179
plant extracts would be hard to keep

675
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:41,158
consistent from batch to batch

676
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:43,259
it will and I think it's going to be a

677
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,960
burden on the industry to prove to the

678
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:48,000
federal government that

679
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,819
we may not have that batch to batch

680
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,819
consistency but the methods of

681
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:56,158
extraction and the methods of production

682
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:59,339
are robust enough to ensure consumer

683
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,200
safety throughout each batch

684
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:03,720
all right

685
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,880
um so we started the conversation

686
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,500
talking about you know you know how many

687
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,419
patients how many patients do we think

688
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,819
are using Vape

689
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:14,820
um and I kind of wanted to to talk about

690
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:16,859
you know for folks maybe who are using

691
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:19,319
cannabis medicine now and aren't using

692
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:20,699
Vape but maybe you want to get into it

693
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:23,460
um what are some tips or some best

694
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:26,519
practices for how they can do that

695
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:29,159
well I think the the the the fundamental

696
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,879
aspect behind this is bioavailability

697
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,919
uh is how these cannabinoids and how

698
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,200
these consumption methods are affecting

699
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,600
the users so the short answer is it's

700
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,940
going to be different with everyone now

701
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,038
there are ways to get there you know how

702
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,840
when we talk about Edibles

703
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:48,240
um it states even on a lot of packaging

704
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,980
please just have one wait at least an

705
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,460
hour before having another one because

706
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:56,579
uh because of the onset time it's kind

707
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:59,460
of the same thing with Vapes now

708
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:02,519
with Vapes I think one of the best tips

709
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:05,278
we can give is whether you're using a

710
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,440
disposable or or another battery is

711
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,099
really use the lowest setting possible

712
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,100
the lowest setting in terms of voltage

713
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:17,278
that's possible will allow to have

714
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:19,519
better flavor because of the terpenes

715
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:22,259
and the flavonoids that have lower

716
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:25,379
boiling points so you'll have better

717
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:28,679
flavor and you'll ease into the the high

718
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,419
aspect of of the product now once you

719
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,759
get used to that low setting then you

720
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:35,278
can start increasing a little bit and

721
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:38,278
really understand how that works

722
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:40,740
for you as a patient because it is

723
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:42,659
totally different again from one patient

724
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,220
to another

725
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,899
um I think if there's one piece of

726
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,120
advice that's the one I would give is

727
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:51,000
really look at the lowest setting first

728
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,379
to make sure that you get the effects

729
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,839
that you're actually looking for with

730
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,720
these devices now there's a whole bunch

731
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:00,000
of other little things I stated earlier

732
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,798
make sure that you have unique serial

733
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,200
numbers make sure you have the coas of

734
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:06,019
the oil make sure you're buying from a

735
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,759
reputable brand

736
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:10,319
a lot of Brands now have uh have the

737
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,500
possibility of entering a serial number

738
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,119
to see if the product is uh is is a fake

739
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,278
one or not

740
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:20,699
um I think I think those are really the

741
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:23,880
next best steps and the last thing I

742
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,179
would recommend is asking the uh the bud

743
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,760
Tenders in the dispensaries if they can

744
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:33,240
provide any kind of research they have

745
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:35,819
on uh that particular product

746
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,220
excellent and now is there any way to

747
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:40,918
sort of figure out how many milligrams

748
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:44,339
you're getting per draw

749
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,320
it that's there is absolutely no way I I

750
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:48,298
always laugh when I hear uh when I hear

751
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,460
people talking about dosing and cannabis

752
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:54,119
and cannabis uh vaping devices

753
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,220
um because dosing depends on each and

754
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,639
every one of us it depends on our

755
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,980
endocannabinoid system it depends on uh

756
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,419
on on something as simple as a length of

757
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,980
a puff

758
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:10,919
um and all the way down to the viscosity

759
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,380
the uh the porosity of the ceramic

760
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,080
um and uh or or or the other kind of

761
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:20,278
wicking material that's used in the coil

762
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:22,379
um it depends on so many things uh so uh

763
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:25,019
there there really is no way to say that

764
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,480
what we can do is

765
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:28,558
look at each device and be able to

766
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,500
predict

767
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,839
how much depending on the oil itself be

768
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:38,339
able to predict how much is going to be

769
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:40,678
available to the user but again that's

770
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,079
not really dosing I like to say dosing

771
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,440
is the cartridge itself or the device

772
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:48,720
itself in this there is one milligram of

773
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,000
THC that is the maximum amount you're

774
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,380
going to be having when you're done with

775
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,859
the cartridge whether you finish it in

776
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,179
tent puffs or 10 000 Puffs that is the

777
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:00,658
maximum amount you're going to be

778
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:03,179
getting so it's more a factor of here's

779
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:06,320
one milligram of nicotine and

780
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:08,340
understanding how long that lasts so

781
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,798
unfortunately it's really trial and

782
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:12,839
error for patients but again starting

783
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,460
with that lower temperature is really

784
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:15,538
going to help patients understand how

785
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,399
this works

786
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:18,839
yeah and the other consideration too

787
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:20,099
would be how much oil is left in the

788
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,398
cart right like you were talking about

789
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:25,579
with uh with CVN if if you're at half

790
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:29,278
the car you might already be out

791
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:32,220
exactly and uh and unfortunately only

792
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:34,519
science research and time will tell us

793
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,200
how to uh get a better grasp on that

794
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:39,298
what I can say is that there are ways to

795
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,120
get consistent delivery

796
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:44,099
um the we just came out with a device

797
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,798
called the simple and we're very pleased

798
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:48,778
to see that throughout the 90 of the

799
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,819
device we have consistent delivery of

800
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:54,058
all the major cannabinoids

801
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:56,759
um but that is also due to a new

802
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:58,379
technology and a new way of creating the

803
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:00,298
device we could have never learned that

804
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,278
if we hadn't looked at how this worked

805
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:05,579
in regular cartridges

806
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:06,419
excellent all right and so winding now

807
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:09,000
now

808
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,200
um I want to give you an opportunity to

809
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,878
plug

810
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,858
um any other resources that you think

811
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:15,898
would be helpful for the listeners uh

812
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:18,000
that they can learn more and of course

813
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:21,299
plug your company as well

814
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,418
uh well you can uh you can definitely uh

815
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,500
look for uh The Vape survey on our

816
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,739
website

817
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,480
um bling.com

818
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:34,819
theblinkgroup.com

819
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:38,639
Vape survey that is a an initial

820
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:42,179
user generated topography data research

821
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,099
on how users and we've separated into in

822
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,500
Canada and the US we've interviewed a

823
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:49,139
thousand users to understand how they

824
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,300
vape and how they Vape cannabis

825
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:52,740
specifically that was really to

826
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,679
understand the differences between the

827
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:59,819
nicotine puffing regime cannabis puffing

828
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,660
regime we all know that if we used a

829
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:05,940
joint or a vape like we do a cigarette

830
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:09,239
we would basically be way too high

831
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,099
because a cigarette is roughly 12 Puffs

832
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:14,939
and you've got a few minutes to take

833
