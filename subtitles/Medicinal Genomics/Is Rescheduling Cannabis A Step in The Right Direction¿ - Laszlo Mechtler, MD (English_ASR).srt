1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,629
[Music]

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,679
so you mentioned rescheduling and I

3
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:19,839
think that's something that we're all

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,518
sort of watching and hopeful for that

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,759
there we'll see some movement there but

6
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:27,559
so say um it does get rescheduled I

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,118
think what schedule three is one of is

8
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:31,519
what's on the table here how would

9
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,439
things change for you if if that were to

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,119
happen

11
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,519
well it's going to change a lot of

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,799
things um so schedule three is like

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,440
camine um and I think tan Cod number

14
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,959
three is in schedule three also so first

15
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,640
of all it's still going to be federally

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,039
legal

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:57,679
illegal but locally I could do a

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,600
prospective study looking at cannabis in

19
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,640
a treatment of I'm going to give you an

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,840
example I do have a protocol which I

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,879
wrote for this for chronic migraine

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,840
migraines defined by marting 15

23
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:14,679
headaches a month uh and I can look at a

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,040
uh Placebo or a 20 to1 1:1 ratio and 5

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,799
10 15 20 milligram that's a perspective

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,118
study there'll be several arms I could

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,640
do that you can ask me who's gonna fund

28
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:28,840
that I'm gonna say right now nobody

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:33,759
who's going to fund it we're GNA fund it

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:37,680
uh I have a benevolent um uh uh family

31
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,879
Dent family Dent was a uh philanthropist

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,439
back in the 60s who by the way had

33
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,118
Parkinson's diseas started Institute in

34
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:47,078
1963 and there is a family

35
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,280
non-for-profit Family Foundation that

36
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:52,319
supports research within the Institute

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,399
and they by the way for the last six

38
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:59,519
seven years have unequivocally supported

39
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,399
my research in cannabis and that and

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,359
that's

41
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,640
and that has given me the opportunity to

42
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,159
publish to put us on the map they still

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,038
support but we're not talk about

44
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,080
Millions we're talking about significant

45
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,559
amount but they do support us so yeah

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,440
I'm gonna get some seed money from them

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,239
to

48
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:21,079
support a study if I can do that if it

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,519
becomes a schedule three drug and then I

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,120
can publish that article prospectively

51
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,599
randomiz

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,879
study part of the money from seed money

53
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,560
from the dent Family Foundation

54
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,199
part of the money through the dent

55
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,719
cannabis clinic will you know we

56
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,318
readjust money to put it in research uh

57
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,519
so instead of putting it in our pockets

58
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,639
we'll put it in research self-funded if

59
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,879
you want to use the term and then we

60
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,359
could publish that once we publish that

61
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,759
I could show it to the insurance

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,840
companies I can show it to the medical

63
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,120
societies and then then let them

64
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,120
critique it and you know one of the

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,158
things is one of the problems I think

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,239
you may understand is cannabis medical

67
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,318
marijuana or medical cannabis programs

68
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,439
are too expensive for patients yeah now

69
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:10,280
I did it a way about I did a way you

70
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,199
don't have to pay me cash that's a

71
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,598
positive for the patient right but they

72
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:17,039
have to pay in cash and some of these

73
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,959
patients are paying $800 a month they

74
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,039
can't afford it and let me be honest

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,239
with you in the medical marijuana

76
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,679
program most of the people can't afford

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,360
it and because they can't afford it and

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
the insurance companies throw their arms

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,840
up say you know we're sympathetic we

80
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,759
know that if you put somebody on medical

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,640
marijuana they'll tell take less opioids

82
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:43,000
they'll take less Xanax they'll take

83
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:45,759
less sleeping pills they'll take less uh

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
anti-inflammatories so it's good for the

85
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,280
insurance companies but they fall back

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,680
on the fact no research yeah so if I

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,000
have a prospective study the first thing

88
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm going to do is present it to every

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,680
CEO of every insurance companies because

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,879
let's pay for this because you a I say

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,760
gave you money I keep patients out of

92
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:05,959
emergency rooms they have less testing

93
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,919
because their quality of life have

94
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,799
improved and they're L using less drug

95
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,359
so that's the first thing I'll do so

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,319
that may change something uh at that

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,759
level then the medical societies will

98
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,798
look at it critique it uh it'll be

99
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,840
published in uh in peer review journals

100
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,719
which is very important and maybe we

101
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:28,359
start moving at the medical society

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,280
level uh so I'm optimistic that for me

103
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,400
it's going to be fine it's going to be a

104
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,239
step in the right direction I'm not sure

105
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,519
if it's going to help the business of

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,879
cannabis because that's still federally

107
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:42,758
legal there's still taxation

108
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,959
issues um um banking issues as you all

109
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,080
know and yeah I don't get involved in

110
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,439
that I just read what I read so but in

111
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:54,519
my perspective I think it's a positive

112
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:56,719
move yeah so will insurance companies

113
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,879
they will well I mean there's a lot that

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,160
goes into it but be it being a schedule

115
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,759
three drug which would not you know

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,759
preclude them from from covering

117
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,800
it it could be a schedule three drug but

118
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,120
it but anything you use it for it's off

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,759
label because it's off label because

120
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,800
it's not not been approved in that

121
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,560
disease for example uh what disease say

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,439
migraine that's makes it easy 36 million

123
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,839
migrain in this country 36 or 700,000

124
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,038
patient in the United States with FS

125
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,079
yeah that's a lot of

126
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:33,759
patients will they prove it they won't

127
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:37,599
because show me the research right right

128
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,600
right how can I prove a drug off label

129
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,160
that there's no science that shows it

130
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,240
works then you go testimonials well I

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,600
have patients who can't live without it

132
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,400
that doesn't count it doesn't

133
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,600
testimonials don't

134
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,599
count randomized phase two phase three

135
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,720
studies do count yeah so that's what

136
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,720
we'll have to do and we'll do

137
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,478
it

138
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:10,448
[Music]

139
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,478
a
