thursday and friday

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,960
this decision was made after careful

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
evaluation and consideration by our

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,640
management team

27
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,319
and various state officials and it was

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,560
done in the interest of safety

29
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,319
so that we can hold a safe in-person

42
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,959
today's guest

43
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,759
professor rafael mitchullum professor

44
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,719
mitchulam

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,560
is the first researcher to isolate thc

46
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,399
in cbd

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
for that achievement and the decades of

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,680
research into the endocannabinoid system

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,159
that followed

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,960
professor mitchulum is often called the

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,880
godfather of cannabis research

52
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,519
since his research began in the early

53
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,078
60s professor mitchulum has received

54
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,200
numerous

55
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,000
academic awards most recently the harvey

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,640
prize from

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
the technion israel institute of

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,238
technology

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,920
in the human health category it's a

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
pretty big deal when you consider more

61
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,039
than 30 percent of harvey

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,520
laureates since 1986 have gone on to

63
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,359
receive the nobel prize

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,719
professor mitchulum has presented at

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,520
every canmet event

66
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,519
either in person or via submitted video

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,360
and he is the chair of our scientific

68
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,000
advisory board

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,000
in our conversation we discuss professor

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
mitchullum's incredible career

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,759
the disappointing lack of cannabis

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,280
medicine clinical trials

73
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,439
the surprising fact that the two major

74
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,919
endocannabinoids

75
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,680
anandamide and 2ag have never been

76
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,359
administered to humans

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,800
the challenges of researching the

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
entourage effect

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
the benefits of cannabinoid acids the

80
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,800
newly discovered anandamide like

81
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
compounds that could be used to treat

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
addiction

83
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040
and much more before we get to that

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,719
conversation

85
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,158
i would like to thank this episode's

sponsor cannabis science and technology

87
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,280
cannabis science and technology focuses

88
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,679
on educating the legal cannabis industry

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,199
about the science and technology of

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,640
analytical testing

91
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,719
quality control and assurance extraction

92
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,479
cultivation and processing and

93
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,400
manufacturing

94
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,479
in october cannabis science and

95
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,640
technology launched a new brand

96
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,000
cannabis patient care which is an

97
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,279
educational resource for

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,919
patients doctors nurses pharmacists

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,719
and caregivers on the latest research

100
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,199
benefits

101
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,239
and treatment options cannabis provides

102
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,598
for a variety

103
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,439
of illnesses go to cannabis science

104
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:51,679
dot to learn more and lastly it wouldn't

105
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,158
be the canmed coffee talk podcast

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,000
without some good coffee and for that we

107
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,438
always turn to the hemp and coffee

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,360
exchange

109
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,799
if you don't know hemp coffee is a

110
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
healthy delicious

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,480
natural product rich in trace minerals

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,719
and nutrients

113
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,798
providing sustained energy without the

114
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,318
crash of regular coffee

124
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,240
good evening professor mitchum thanks so

125
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,719
much for joining us

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,680
it's a pleasure first i want to

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,680
congratulate you

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,439
on the harvey prize that you recently

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
won for your life's work on the end of

130
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,600
cannabinoid system

131
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,280
very well deserved and dare i say long

132
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,439
overdue

133
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,439
um you've mentioned in the past that

134
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,360
there was really not a lot of interest

135
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,279
in exploring cannabis when you first got

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,680
started in the 60s

137
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,719
but what about cannabis inspired you to

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
start

139
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,280
investigating it well

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,520
you see the chemistry and pharmacology

141
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:23,918
of morphine cocaine the other major

142
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:26,240
addictive drugs these were known

143
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,319
starting from the 19th century

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,519
not only the chemistry but extensive

145
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,000
pharmacology

146
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,719
extensive knowledge this was not the

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,120
case

148
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,919
of cannabinoids and the reason was that

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,879
well there is a chemical reason it's a

150
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,959
really a

151
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,079
big mixture very difficult to isolate

152
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,198
the compounds

153
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:49,839
and to chemist

154
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,879
major figures in the chemical field

155
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:56,399
had worked in the 30s early 40s

156
00:05:52,879 --> 00:06:00,079
and because of the war they stopped

157
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:02,719
and later on it was not taken up

158
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,959
probably also because of legal reasons

159
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,080
very difficult for an academic

160
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:11,198
lab to work on compounds that are

161
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,159
legally restricted one probably has to

162
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,720
have a

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
somebody looking around to say that

164
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,800
students

165
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,159
don't take it or whatever anyway very

166
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,240
very there was one

167
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
group not a major group in germany that

168
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,319
was working and

169
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,319
maybe a few others but essentially it

170
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
was a

171
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,560
field that nobody was working then

172
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,800
although as i said

173
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,478
morphine and cocaine chemistry

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,680
pharmacology clinical

175
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:44,159
trials were well known

176
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,519
decades previously so i thought it's a

177
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,039
good idea to go ahead and i was lucky

178
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,038
that i could get a hold of cannabis

179
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,519
i assumed that i wouldn't have been able

180
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,639
to do that in the u.s because of legal

181
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,918
reasons

182
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,918
and here i just

183
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,758
went to the police after a phone call

184
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,799
from the

185
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:10,160
administrative head of my uh

186
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,720
uh my institute i will they ask

187
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
can they depend on me and he without

188
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,039
even knowing me said of course you can

189
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,280
depend on

190
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,879
mushrooms so i went there they gave me

191
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,758
five kilos of ashes

192
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,439
and we started work i doubt very much

193
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,080
doubt but i would have been able to do

194
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,519
that

195
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:29,279
in most other places

196
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,959
sure and so you've mentioned that there

197
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,318
was a lot of work going into

198
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:37,680
other drugs like morphine or heroin

199
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,759
um how come there was no

200
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
there was no concern studying those

201
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,840
drugs but

202
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,720
there was with cannabis well i was not

203
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,839
interested in those you see i didn't

204
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,879
have a

205
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,758
a group doing research i had to do

206
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,360
that with my own hands and a friend of

207
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,960
mine with the two of us

208
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,400
um good only we are close friends

209
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:05,279
and this was it so we couldn't uh

210
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,959
compete with major groups working in

211
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,918
anything else

212
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,878
we i thought that the best idea is to

213
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,399
work on

214
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,840
topics that we can do

215
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,598
without without major

216
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,038
without having a major group without

217
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,759
having a lot of money to do it

218
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,360
so now you started studying in the 1960s

219
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,280
and when you did that did you think that

220
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,038
you would still be working on cannabis

221
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,718
today or that we would be where we are

222
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,679
today

223
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,440
no not not really i thought that we'll

224
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,478
do the chemistry

225
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,839
for a couple of years and

226
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:48,080
that was it then it turned out that we

227
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:51,200
always found new and new topics

228
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,680
of quite a lot of interest

229
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,879
so we had to move uh along all the time

230
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,919
and so the beginning in the

231
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,838
60s early 70s worked mostly in the

232
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,360
chemistry and then under

233
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,120
pharmacology and metabolism then

234
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,839
a little bit later or quite a bit later

235
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,320
it was realized that there are receptors

236
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,800
so

237
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,000
we went ahead and looked for compounds

238
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,319
that are formed

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,120
in the animal body animal brain if you

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,560
wish

241
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,679
and we found that yes there are specific

242
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,239
compounds

243
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,039
that add and here we had a new

244
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,480
physiological system a completely new

245
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:36,399
physiological system nobody had

246
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,680
done anything on it because it was not

247
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,799
known and it turned out that it is

248
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,879
of major interest as a matter of fact

249
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:48,399
people at nih wrote a

250
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:51,360
review at that time i remember and

251
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,159
wrote that the can endocannabinoid

252
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,839
system

253
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:58,610
is involved in almost all human diseases

254
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,360
now that's a very very uh

255
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,360
[Music]

256
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,720
it's a thing that one cannot really

257
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,720
accept so easily

258
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,800
even the major uh neurotransmitters like

259
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,560
dopamine and serotonin

260
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,519
what cannot say that they are involved

261
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:18,159
in essentially all human diseases now

262
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,720
this being the case there there is a lot

263
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,199
of work so we went ahead doing all

264
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,920
a lot of additional chemistry additional

265
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,320
pharmacology to large extent

266
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:33,679
uh clinical trials to the

267
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,959
that we could do and so it uh

268
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:39,120
developed and expanded and uh that was

269
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,119
it

270
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,039
now you say it's sort of hard to imagine

271
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
that

272
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,719
the endocannabinoid system is involved

273
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,919
in every

274
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,399
disease or every body system um and it

275
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,679
is

276
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,399
quite amazing to what extent is it

277
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,120
involved though is it essential or is it

278
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,360
sort of just a contributor

279
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,480
well it seems we don't know about all

280
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,360
diseases

281
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
certainly but it is definitely involved

282
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,839
in

283
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:12,719
many many of them and so uh

284
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,720
i can't really define whether in a

285
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
certain disease is the central one or

286
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
not

287
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,200
we have to go and look at each one of

288
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,120
them

289
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,240
and uh but it is now we also have a

290
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,000
problem

291
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,519
a major problem and it is that

292
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,720
not another and the two uh endogenous

293
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,440
cannabinoids

294
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,519
that we discovered uh anandamite and 2ag

295
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,839
they have never been administered or

296
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,720
human

297
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:48,079
so uh what happens is that

298
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,720
we can only say well it works in mice

299
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,559
in a model of a human disease and so on

300
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,160
so we have a problem there

301
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:59,439
but that's where we stand but even so

302
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:02,719
there is a lot a lot of work our paper

303
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,720
in which we described uh

304
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,000
the isolation identification of

305
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,360
anandamide

306
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
has been cited more than six thousand

307
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,079
times which

308
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,399
is very unusual for a paper

309
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,319
and the same is true for two-way there

310
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,039
two three thousand times

311
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,600
being cited so there is a lot of

312
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,599
interest

313
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,959
in uh whatever these compounds do

314
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,519
or whatever they are involved into

315
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,679
so that that shocked me when i learned

316
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,240
that anandamide and 2ag have never

317
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,000
actually been administered to humans

318
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,320
what is the reason for that especially

319
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,759
when there's plenty of examples of

320
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,000
cannabinoids which are you know

321
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,078
created by the plant to sort of mimic

322
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,600
these compounds have been administered

323
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,638
why not the real thing well i can only

324
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,959
imagine

325
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,560
see in order for a compound to be

326
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,278
administered to a human

327
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,078
one has to do a lot of preliminary

328
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,639
things

329
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,199
a lot of toxicology of a lot of other

330
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,200
things and

331
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,800
for example a drug in order to be

332
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,240
administered

333
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:15,759
to a human one has to spend a lot

334
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,799
a lot of money and this is done usually

335
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,720
by uh

336
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:23,278
by companies well there is no company

337
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,040
involved because uh there are no patents

338
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,759
in these compounds

339
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,759
and if we had patents they would uh we

340
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,958
publish these things in the

341
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:36,240
early 90s so that's uh far away

342
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,439
and so no pharmaceutical companies

343
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,240
interested

344
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,480
and the governments do not do that so

345
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,959
here we have a strange situation

346
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,079
which uh compound which is not toxic or

347
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,278
two compounds

348
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:52,638
which are not toxic which are uh

349
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:55,759
very much involved in our physiology uh

350
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,759
which have a lot of

351
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,519
effects that are very relevant to

352
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,240
to what we're doing these compounds have

353
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,919
never

354
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,919
been tested in humans strange but

355
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,479
that's it now i can't do it because we

356
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,599
don't have the the amount of money

357
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,480
needed for that

358
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,680
we don't do toxicology and these things

359
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,159
cost

360
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,000
millions so there we are strange

361
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,360
situation but there we are

362
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,559
wow that almost seems criminal i mean it

363
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,680
seems like a

364
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,518
tremendous opportunity um missed and

365
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,719
that someone should really take up that

366
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,600
that mantle well what companies are

367
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,278
doing

368
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:43,278
they are trying to work on the enzymes

369
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:47,120
that synthesize anandamite into ag

370
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:49,120
they can block uh and so the

371
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,240
the body doesn't make an antibiotic or

372
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,560
on the contrary

373
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,839
they block the enzymes that

374
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:00,159
metabolize the nandomite into hg so the

375
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,279
levels of anandamite and 2hg

376
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:06,639
go up so here we have something

377
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:09,039
that is done not straightforward a

378
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,039
little bit

379
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:17,120
in a strange way or for example

380
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:21,120
uh a runner if somebody

381
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,919
runs and gets exhausted by running

382
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,078
so one would expect him to be well kind

383
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,120
of uh

384
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:32,239
wells not very happy

385
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,000
no we know that there is a

386
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,839
runner's happiness or something like

387
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,639
that and this is due

388
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,519
to the enhancement of anandamite if a

389
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,278
person

390
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,480
does a lot of uh physical exercise

391
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:49,919
the anandamites the anandamite goes up

392
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:54,159
and the person is in a better mood

393
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:57,599
so this is kind not a direct way of um

394
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:01,838
uh increasing anatomite or

395
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,839
if one gives cannabidiol

396
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:08,958
a group of uh found that if one

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,799
administers very high doses of

398
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,000
cannabidiol

399
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,719
in this case to schizophrenic patients

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,159
uh the cannabidiol acts under

401
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,040
schizophrenia it's a

402
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,679
pretty good anti-schizophrenic compound

403
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:27,519
its effect is also an anatomic

404
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,359
anandamite goes up quite a bit

405
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,679
maybe there's the mechanism the effect

406
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,120
but it goes up so this is

407
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:38,319
one way of changing the

408
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,278
levels of anandobite in the body

409
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
that's great um and as a runner myself i

410
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,519
can say that

411
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:47,758
um i get healthy doses of anandamide

412
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,440
after every run which um which keeps me

413
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,079
coming back for more

414
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,360
you smile after that of course yeah i

415
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,319
love it

416
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,919
good um so i was hoping we could maybe

417
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,278
take a step back for maybe people who

418
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,479
aren't so familiar with the end of

419
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,000
cannabinoid system

420
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
could you give sort of a brief

421
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,798
explanation of you know what are

422
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,480
anandamide and 2ag doing in the body and

423
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,639
why is it beneficial to have good levels

424
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,400
of it

425
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,679
well we don't have a full picture of

426
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,439
what they do

427
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,720
but most definitely

428
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,600
they are the major uh compounds in the

429
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,279
body

430
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,558
that uh stimulate the endocannabinoid

431
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,599
system

432
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,240
and the endocannabinoid system is

433
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,319
involved

434
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,960
in a huge number of disease states

435
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,678
so the body

436
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,880
[Music]

437
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,960
produces an endomite when one has pain

438
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,480
for example

439
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,319
without an antibiotic the pain will stay

440
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
for a longer period of time

441
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,960
so you get pain and then the body starts

442
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,880
producing an endomite around the

443
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,519
painful place of the body and

444
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,640
the pain goes down or in the brain it

445
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,400
acts under

446
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,320
uh pain effect in the brain after all

447
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,679
if we have pain somewhere on the body

448
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,639
the effect is

449
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,000
uh through the central nervous system so

450
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,120
anandamite acts on

451
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,079
pain as a matter of fact uh

452
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,038
this is one of the major ways we lower

453
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,399
pain

454
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:26,400
but anandamite is not does not stay

455
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,440
around for a very long time

456
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:34,480
it is produced when and where

457
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:37,600
needed uh it acts and it is more or less

458
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,640
broken down immediately

459
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,159
so the same is the two for 2ag so here

460
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,200
we have a

461
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,000
compound which is a reaction if you wish

462
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
to uh physiological states and this is

463
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,440
the

464
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,679
and the same is for many other disease

465
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,160
states

466
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,200
so it's really not produced unless there

467
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,919
is some sort of

468
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
uh stress or some sort of stimulus there

469
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
well

470
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:08,480
not as stress obviously but also it's

471
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:11,599
part of our uh individuality if you wish

472
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,319
some people are uh have a i mean

473
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,079
there is a difference in personality and

474
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,359
one of the reasons for the difference in

475
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,558
personality

476
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:23,678
is the endocannabinoids um

477
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,960
a person with uh let's say happier

478
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,038
personality

479
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,000
may have more anandamide than a person

480
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,440
that's uh

481
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,200
that is not so it has to do with

482
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,320
what we are excellent

483
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,038
and now so where does cannabis play into

484
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,639
this

485
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,720
what are the compounds in cannabis that

486
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,400
sort of mimic the effects of anandamide

487
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,000
into a g

488
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,360
well i don't believe that plant

489
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,839
really wanted to do anything to us

490
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:58,719
it uh produces canopy noise because of

491
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,839
its own needs you see we are not

492
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,360
different

493
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:05,199
from most animals in our physiology

494
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,000
our physiology contains a lot of

495
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,558
compounds hormones neurotransmitters and

496
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,919
so on

497
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:15,279
but also so there's a horse or peak

498
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:20,400
whatever this is not true for plants

499
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:24,798
plants don't have the same

500
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,600
chemical thing as other plants

501
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,279
every family of plants or almost every

502
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,558
family of plants

503
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,918
produces different compounds that

504
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,240
act for them for example a certain plant

505
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,000
is

506
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,038
attacked by uh some insects

507
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,400
over them the years over the ages uh the

508
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,200
plant has

509
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,240
produced started producing compounds

510
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,840
against

511
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,679
their specific enemies and so

512
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:58,399
every plant family has its own

513
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,679
group of compounds which in many cases

514
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
are specific

515
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,960
for that plant for that plant family and

516
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,320
so is

517
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,120
uh with the canon cannabis uh group of

518
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,839
of plants there are two or three they

519
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,798
make

520
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,639
compounds of this type no other plant

521
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:18,400
does it only plants

522
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,640
that belong to this particular family of

523
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,640
uh

524
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,039
plants so they

525
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,440
they are produced for their own reason

526
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,519
we're

527
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,720
not exactly sure why they produce them

528
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,879
whether it has to do with

529
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,798
something to do with the soil they were

530
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,919
originally grown on or

531
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,599
it's something that has to do with fungi

532
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,320
or microbes

533
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,959
we have seen that some of these

534
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,158
compounds

535
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,840
have anti-microbial effects and so on so

536
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,640
we don't know exactly

537
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,519
why cannabis makes the compounds but it

538
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,840
does

539
00:21:53,519 --> 00:22:00,558
and these compounds are

540
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:03,918
specific and there are about 100 of them

541
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:06,960
the two or three are the major ones

542
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:11,038
and there we stand

543
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,038
excellent and in preparation for this

544
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,798
conversation i went back and and watched

545
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,558
your camed 2019

546
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,158
presentation which i will put in the

547
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:18,960
show notes for everyone else to enjoy as

548
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,760
well

549
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,960
and at one point you were very uh very

550
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,480
vocal about

551
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,720
the need for more clinical trials in

552
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,960
in terms of whether it's cannabis

553
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,279
medicine or cannabis based medicine or

554
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,640
even the endocannabinoid system

555
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,720
i was wondering if you could speak to

556
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,400
some of the clinical trials that have

557
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,400
happened and if there were to be more

558
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,759
future ones where should researchers

559
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,559
sort of focus their efforts

560
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,519
in your opinion well quite frankly it's

561
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,839
a shame

562
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,599
it's really a shame that we don't have

563
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,720
more clinical trials

564
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,199
a huge huge number of people

565
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,558
take cannabinoids so take a plant

566
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,200
extract

567
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:06,480
for a variety of diseases in most cases

568
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,759
without clinical trials

569
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,279
we know that a cannabinoids act and pain

570
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,279
but pain is not a single

571
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,600
symptom of a disease many there is pain

572
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,480
from that different path in the body and

573
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,158
so on

574
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,519
we don't have large clinical trials

575
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,960
a lot of people take cannabis for uh

576
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,000
cancer well first of all cancer is not a

577
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,519
single disease

578
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,880
there are many types of cancers and

579
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:41,918
so there is there aren't any

580
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,278
real major clinical trials

581
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,240
with cannabinoids and um so people are

582
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,679
taking

583
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,798
cannabis for cancer without really

584
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,159
any background a real background it's

585
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,200
such a shame

586
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,880
the does thc or cbd

587
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,319
uh act uh better on uh

588
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,880
one cancer rather than another one uh

589
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,240
glioma cancer in the brain is not the

590
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,960
same as a

591
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,839
cancer of any other organelles different

592
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,319
types

593
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,359
and we don't know just people are taking

594
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,158
them because

595
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,000
they have heard that that helps we're

596
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,120
the 21st century

597
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,359
it should not be that way and

598
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,158
and the reason is that clinical trials

599
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,719
today

600
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,000
in the western world at least uh

601
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,200
undertaken by

602
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,558
companies governments are not doing

603
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,200
clinical trials

604
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,759
but in this case companies are not

605
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,840
involved because there are no patents

606
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,558
and the company does not want to spend

607
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,839
many millions of

608
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:50,000
dollars or pounds whatever uh

609
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,359
just to try something in for a

610
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,480
publication

611
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:59,038
so here we have a situation

612
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:02,000
which is unacceptable uh

613
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,158
i believe that governments through their

614
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,960
ministries of health or whatever

615
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,400
should do clinical trials because nobody

616
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,079
else is doing them

617
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,720
and nih normally does not do clinical

618
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,599
trials

619
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,278
in this case i believe that nih should

620
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,000
do clinical trials

621
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,240
in order to know where we stand a lot of

622
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,679
people say that

623
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,720
cannabis can cure cancer

624
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,840
well i'm not sure it acts on cancer it

625
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,038
blocks

626
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,038
in in animals

627
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:40,159
cancer development so it has been shown

628
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,120
that cannabinoids can prolong the life

629
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,600
of people that

630
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,639
have a certain type of cancer there is

631
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:49,839
no proof

632
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:52,880
that it's a uh anti-cancer drug

633
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,319
um i believe that it is just it helps

634
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,960
along but it's not

635
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,158
anti-cancer drug but we all these things

636
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,159
have to be

637
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,480
uh investigated in human patients and

638
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,919
not

639
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,599
in uh in animals there we are

640
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,600
well so it seems like a common theme

641
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,839
here there's just not

642
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,798
the investment from companies to look

643
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,959
into it because

644
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,359
there's not a lot of opportunity for

645
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,919
them to make money on it

646
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:23,199
so i think what we need is some

647
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,799
philanthropic person to just donate a

648
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,360
a whole pile of money to investigate

649
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:30,558
these things yes all governments

650
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,839
i mean after all millions are using

651
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,678
cannabis

652
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:39,038
government should probably

653
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,159
look into a problem that's a a wide

654
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,200
problem not

655
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,480
a few individuals we're speaking of

656
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,038
millions

657
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,960
yeah well i think we need to we need to

658
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,879
get them on board with decriminalizing

659
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,400
it and descheduling it first

660
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,760
so i guess baby steps um and i imagine

661
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,640
another thing that's sort of

662
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,119
complicating

663
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,240
the the ability to do real good research

664
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,000
into the effects of

665
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,599
cannabis medicine is this whole idea of

666
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,400
the entourage effect

667
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:12,959
um so one of you'd speak a bit to that

668
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:17,278
well most cannabis users

669
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:21,038
say that in total extract of cannabis

670
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:24,240
is much better for them individually

671
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:27,919
than the specific cannabinoid

672
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:31,359
cbd or thc or whatever and

673
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:36,159
it seems that this is true and we have

674
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:38,079
done a few uh investigations in this

675
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,240
along this line and yes we have seen

676
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,199
that apparently

677
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,960
the extract contains compounds that

678
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,440
affect

679
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:52,240
the thc or cbd actions

680
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,320
and i'm again sorry to say that although

681
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,558
this is widely accepted

682
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,519
and the term entourage effect which we

683
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,398
coined

684
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,798
20 years ago is widely used but there

685
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:06,079
are again no trials with

686
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,960
even in animals we don't know uh

687
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,398
whether uh all the terpenes that are

688
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,640
involved that are present

689
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:16,879
in in cannabis uh together as a group

690
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,799
have to do with the entourage effect or

691
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,600
only two or three

692
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,639
have specific effects uh we don't know

693
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,359
and it's a pity

694
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,320
because we could have uh much better

695
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,519
cannabis

696
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:33,918
if we had the correct knowledge

697
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,558
and i got to imagine a compounding

698
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,038
complication there is just um

699
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:41,278
the variability in different cannabis

700
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,960
strains or even you know plan to plant

701
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,440
of the same strain could have

702
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,960
you know different concentrations of

703
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,000
different compounds just

704
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,240
based on how that plant is uh is grown

705
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,519
so i would imagine in order to do some

706
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,079
real research into

707
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,918
what combination of cannabinoids is

708
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,839
contributing to this effect you need

709
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,679
sort of standardized formulations to

710
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:05,038
look into something like that

711
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,399
most definitely we um for example

712
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:12,079
one can imagine taking thc

713
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:14,719
with two or three or four well-defined

714
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,839
terpenes or flavonoids is better than

715
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
thc itself

716
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,079
maybe but all this has to be

717
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,640
investigated

718
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,759
and it has not been investigated the

719
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,200
number of therapies

720
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:30,720
is quite large we know the structures so

721
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,720
we know the uh what terpenes are present

722
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,558
although they differ of course from

723
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,600
cannabis a team in kind of a syndicate

724
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:40,158
and so on

725
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:43,278
and uh indeed in israel at least

726
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,320
cannabis patients so people that take

727
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,440
cannabis

728
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:50,798
usually take cannabis indica

729
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,679
uh in the evening in cannabis sativa in

730
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:53,759
the morning

731
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,360
because of the different effects but we

732
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,558
don't have enough

733
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,558
data to save money

734
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,080
um so we're getting getting close to the

735
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,080
end here i did want to give you an

736
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,319
opportunity to speak about what research

737
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,439
you're doing now

738
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:12,558
well uh we are

739
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,840
working now mostly on anandamite

740
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,200
like compounds and we've published that

741
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,240
uh

742
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,200
our body uh in addition to anatomic

743
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,079
makes a lot of

744
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,319
compounds which are closely chemically

745
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,038
closely related to an endomite

746
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,918
and then the bite is a fatty acid bound

747
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,839
to a derivative

748
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,480
amino acid and the body has uh

749
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:39,038
quite a few fatty acids and quite a few

750
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,919
amino acids and so it makes a lot of

751
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,679
these compounds we have about uh i don't

752
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,799
know something like a hundred compounds

753
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,480
of this type

754
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,319
and they are not made by the body

755
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,798
because it has nothing else to do

756
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,599
they are made for a specific purpose so

757
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,119
we

758
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,839
found and we is always collaboration

759
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,479
with the

760
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,079
pharmacologists and clinicians found

761
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,798
that it

762
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,480
one of these compounds is very helpful

763
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:07,679
in brain damage

764
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,319
another compound we found is a very

765
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:14,798
efficient in osteoporosis

766
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,798
and over the last few years again

767
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,600
a few groups of friends a group in the

768
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,159
u.s a group in canada

769
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,519
a group in italy in our group together

770
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,039
we are working on

771
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,519
addiction the mechanism of addiction is

772
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,398
not

773
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,399
actually well known for many years it

774
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,879
was believed that addiction

775
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,918
is the psychological effect only and

776
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,360
that's it

777
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,320
well no over the last 15 years 20 years

778
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,798
it has been

779
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,480
recognized that addiction is actually a

780
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,519
kind of a disease and there are all

781
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,919
kinds of

782
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,759
changes that happen in the body and we

783
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,038
don't know much about it

784
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:56,640
so we started looking together

785
00:31:53,038 --> 00:32:00,558
for the changes that happen

786
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,919
and we were quite surprised

787
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:07,519
to find a compound that

788
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,720
our body makes and tries to block it

789
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,038
nicotine addiction we started working on

790
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,000
nicotine addiction and

791
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,599
have moved to opiate addiction and we

792
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,480
found that there is a compound

793
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,759
again anandabyte-like compound it's a

794
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,798
compound

795
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:26,240
made from oleic acid and glycine two

796
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,038
very

797
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,079
well-known compounds so it's uh the

798
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,919
amide of

799
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:38,000
oleic acid with glycine and

800
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,320
og old glycine blocks nicotine addiction

801
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,200
it doesn't always succeed but it blocks

802
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,759
nicotine addiction the body makes it

803
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,640
what's interesting probably even more

804
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,839
important

805
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,759
the this particular compound we found

806
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:56,798
uh blocks the withdrawal effects

807
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,759
of both nicotine addiction and much more

808
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:00,158
important

809
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,398
of opiate addiction and this was quite a

810
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,399
surprise

811
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:09,439
many addicts are afraid to stop

812
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:12,639
the using

813
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,640
opiates because of the withdrawal they

814
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,640
are very afraid of the withdrawal which

815
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,000
is a

816
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,799
really a very painful state so here we

817
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
have a compound that our body makes

818
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,119
not enough but it makes and in animals

819
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,159
at least

820
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:34,158
uh blocks the withdrawal of nicotine

821
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,278
the withdrawal effects of both nicotine

822
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,640
and

823
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:41,200
opiates so i hope that

824
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,360
this will be investigated by a company

825
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,880
the company as a matter of fact

826
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,879
uh has been funding a part of our

827
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,240
efforts in this field

828
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,679
of all four groups and

829
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:59,759
i hope that we can contribute something

830
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,480
quite practical which is far away from

831
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,879
the cannabis in the plant but it's still

832
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,360
closely related to an endobite

833
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,800
so i hope that this is something that

834
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:12,639
will happen we also work

835
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,599
on derivatives on cannabidiol

836
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,878
cannabidiol we didn't speak about it too

837
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,039
much it's a

838
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,878
interesting compound it has a lot a lot

839
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,519
of effects

840
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,239
all of them positive almost all of them

841
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:29,519
positive

842
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:32,959
and it works in a lot of disease states

843
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:36,320
and we thought that maybe

844
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,918
we can make a more potent uh

845
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,599
cannabidiol cannabidiol in schizophrenia

846
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:45,279
as i mentioned to you

847
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,399
has to be administered at very high

848
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,359
doses about

849
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,398
800 milligrams a day acts on

850
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:54,960
schizophrenia

851
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:57,358
that was published by a group in germany

852
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,358
so we thought that maybe we can make

853
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,319
more potent cannabidiols

854
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,719
and yes we have synthesized quite a lot

855
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,280
of

856
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,039
and published quite a lot of cannabidiol

857
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,640
derivatives and

858
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:12,079
some of them are indeed better than

859
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,440
cannabidiol

860
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,400
itself and the company or two companies

861
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,320
are

862
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,280
working on cannabidiol derivatives

863
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,880
wow um if we could go back just for a

864
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,240
minute to talk about

865
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,358
those anandamide-like compounds is it

866
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:34,559
possible that um that

867
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:36,000
you know um there'll be other compounds

868
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,358
in cannabis that are

869
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,280
closely related to that much like um uh

870
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:47,759
happens with anandamide and thc

871
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:51,040
well uh another might and thc

872
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,359
are almost equivalent in their activity

873
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,719
so there are say completely different

874
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:58,078
chemically

875
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:00,559
but their activity is uh

876
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,000
it's closely related the major

877
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,400
difference is that

878
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,400
anandabyte is broken down almost

879
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,720
immediately and so we don't see

880
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,320
in animals the same effect that we see

881
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,519
with thc

882
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,200
but the effect the basic effect

883
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:19,440
is essentially the same uh do we have

884
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,279
compounds

885
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,000
let's say cbd acting like an

886
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,599
endocannabinoid

887
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,639
well they are different but maybe maybe

888
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,200
cannabidiol is uh uh

889
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:36,239
mimicking maybe it mimics one of the

890
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,879
endocannabinoids which have

891
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,439
not been well investigated they said

892
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,200
only

893
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,720
anandamite and to age you have been

894
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,399
investigated for

895
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,519
quite a few additional compounds so

896
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,800
maybe here we have something to

897
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,440
that has to be discovered all right

898
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,640
still

899
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,440
lots of work to be done i'm sure and

900
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,960
another thing that i that jumped out to

901
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,800
me when you were talking was that this

902
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,159
need for collaboration and working with

903
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,880
all these different types of groups

904
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,039
which

905
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,720
um is very near and dear to our hearts

906
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,400
here at canmed

907
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,078
and it's what we try to do every year is

908
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,119
bring together um

909
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,480
everyone who's working on this plant or

910
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,760
working on this problem

911
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,559
and and bring them together so we can

912
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,240
push everything forward so um

913
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,078
it's good to see that uh we're on the

914
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:24,799
same page with that

915
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,680
well in my view it's essential i like

916
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,960
working with

917
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,919
with friends with colleagues and it's

918
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,760
essential

919
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,599
all the problems that come up with the

920
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,599
nanobite with cannabinoids

921
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,880
their chemistry their pharmacological

922
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,880
effect

923
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,358
their clinical effects and so on

924
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,519
there isn't a single group that can do

925
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,838
all these things

926
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,559
simultaneously so the best thing is to

927
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,920
do it

928
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,239
with with colleagues and friends and we

929
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,039
well when there were meetings are not

930
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,519
anymore

931
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,679
personal meetings because of the corona

932
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,239
but we used to sit together

933
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,358
uh drink a lot of coffee shout shout at

934
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,078
each other

935
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,358
well not throw stones at each other but

936
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,839
shouted each other

937
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:10,799
and at the end come up with a suggestion

938
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:12,880
together

939
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,000
uh how to do that and the addiction

940
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,400
thing is uh

941
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,838
probably typical uh

942
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,920
the compound was ident the compound

943
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:28,559
or that acts an addiction was identified

944
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,480
by a group in italy my good friend

945
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:34,480
dimaso

946
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:38,000
it was investigated in quite a lot of

947
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,880
details in canada a group in

948
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,039
uh in the us is also doing work on it

949
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,240
and we've been

950
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,400
doing the the chemistry so

951
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,719
i don't believe that a single group can

952
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,960
do that

953
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,639
absolutely with a problem this big it's

954
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,000
going to take all of us

955
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,759
um so i know our problem is to have

956
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,239
the problem is to have good friends and

957
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,240
colleagues

958
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,320
absolutely and hopefully we can um we

959
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,960
can

960
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,320
create a venue to create new friends and

961
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,440
colleagues at canmed

962
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,960
so um professor mitchullum i want to

963
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,000
thank you again for taking the time to

964
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,079
speak with us today

965
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,440
it's been a pleasure and uh thank you

966
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,680
for everything you've done to help ken

967
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,599
met over here

968
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,440
first of all thank you very much in your

969
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,760
questions you asked about the

970
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,159
cannabinoid assets

971
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,359
absolutely if you have the time i'd love

972
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,199
to learn more about that

973
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:37,199
well you see the plant doesn't produce

974
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,319
thc or cbd

975
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:43,279
the plant produces their precursors

976
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,599
which are cannabinoid acids which are

977
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,640
not stable as soon as they are produced

978
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,760
they slowly break down and there is a

979
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,799
cannabidiolic

980
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:56,160
acid which forms cannabidiol thc

981
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,440
acid which forms thc

982
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,719
so these acids have not been

983
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,960
investigated

984
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,919
thoroughly because they are not stable

985
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,800
and a

986
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,159
researcher cannot really work with

987
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,480
unstable compounds

988
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,000
because he doesn't know whether the

989
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,159
effects are due to the

990
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,159
original compound or the compound that

991
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:20,239
has been formed

992
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:23,519
but so we managed to stabilize

993
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:25,519
uh cannabidiolic acid and we work with a

994
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:29,039
stable cannabidiolic acid

995
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:31,920
and it turned out that it is of a

996
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,960
considerable importance it has a lot of

997
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,159
effects

998
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,039
and companies looking at these effects

999
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,559
and so on

1000
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:43,039
it has to do again in collaboration uh

1001
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,239
we found all these things it has to do

1002
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,920
with

1003
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:50,000
anxiety it has to do with some other

1004
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,358
effects of this type but it also has to

1005
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,920
do with

1006
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,119
pain and inflammation and so there is a

1007
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,318
lot of work

1008
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,280
going on now in my in my life together

1009
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,119
with friends

1010
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,200
and i believe that these compounds may

1011
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,119
turn out to be

1012
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:10,078
as important as cbd and hopefully

1013
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,559
now is it that they are more effective

1014
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,480
at

1015
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,000
doing the same thing that the non-acid

1016
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,000
forms um

1017
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,119
do or is it a just completely different

1018
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,280
effect

1019
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:25,119
no no they seem to be more or less

1020
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,000
as cbd for example cbd acid stable cbd

1021
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,039
acid

1022
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,199
has turned out to be a very very

1023
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,759
powerful in pain

1024
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,679
more powerful than cbd by far more

1025
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,880
powerful than cbd

1026
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,719
and a colleague in canada published that

1027
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,079
and he found it

1028
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,039
it's uh many many times more powerful

1029
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,079
than

1030
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:51,759
cbd but surprisingly he

1031
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:55,200
found it it acts better you know

1032
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,400
essentially only in male mice but not in

1033
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,759
female mice and i don't know why wow

1034
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,599
well that's certainly interesting so it

1035
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,800
could be that we see more

1036
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:09,838
cbda mark products on the market

1037
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,680
in the coming years well i hope so a

1038
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,239
company is

1039
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:17,358
working on those compounds and they

1040
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:20,159
support some of our work and they

1041
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:22,559
they're trying to develop these

1042
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,159
compounds at least

1043
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,559
maybe some derivatives of these

1044
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:29,598
compounds and

1045
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,078
i have not seen any toxic effects so i

1046
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,880
believe

1047
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,079
that these compounds may reach the

1048
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,358
public as

1049
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,599
official drugs in a few years i hope so

1050
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:40,960
excellent all right well before i let

1051
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,800
you go is there anything else you'd like

1052
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,000
to discuss

1053
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,880
no it uh it as you mentioned at the

1054
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,800
beginning

1055
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,800
we thought that it's a small project and

1056
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,119
it it has turned out to be

1057
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,560
a major project and when we started work

1058
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,039
there was nobody working

1059
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:02,799
now there are uh probably hundreds

1060
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,279
of researchers people that developed

1061
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,560
them

1062
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,519
people that sell these compounds and

1063
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,078
so one never knows exactly what will

1064
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,280
happen

1065
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,480
when one starts a new project but

1066
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,200
what i when students come up to me and

1067
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,400
say

1068
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,679
what should i choose to work on a new

1069
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,960
faculty member

1070
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,960
i always say start with a problem

1071
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,240
that nobody else is working on you have

1072
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,679
a better chance

1073
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,799
of succeeding than being just one of a

1074
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,559
major

1075
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,119
group of researchers that are

1076
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,000
doing work on something that's

1077
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,440
reasonably well

1078
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,199
known certainly good advice

1079
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,240
