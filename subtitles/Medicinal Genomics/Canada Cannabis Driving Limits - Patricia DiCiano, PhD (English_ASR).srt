2
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,800
limits for THC concentrations uh for

3
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,959
drivers in Canada what are those and

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,000
sort of you know based on your research

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,039
or your knowledge in the area um do you

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,719
have an opinion is that too low too high

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,519
or so the legal limits vary by

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:34,719
jurisdiction some some don't have limits

9
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,679
others have limits of blood THC so THC

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,160
being a psychoactive component of

11
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:43,119
cannabis that's thought to impair

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:45,718
driving um five five nanograms per Mill

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,519
seems to be the the limit that most

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,399
people sort of um talk about and in

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,760
Canada we have two different limits one

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,719
is two nanograms per Mill which is sort

17
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:57,679
of the lower uh level of offense and

18
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,879
then five nanograms per Mill which is a

19
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,439
higher level of offense and so the

20
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,558
jurisdictions vary some have a zero

21
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,640
tolerance which has a zero nanogram per

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,798
Mill threshold and others have two

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,840
others have five um so in the paper that

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,880
you have mentioned uh what what we

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,680
looked at was whether or not there's a

26
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:21,319
relationship of THC and the blood to

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,079
impaired driving of course one way to

28
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:27,478
deter driving after the use of cannabis

29
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:30,399
is to look at blood THC um and and see

30
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,280
how that and see what the levels are so

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,118
police officer suspects somebody of

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,079
being impaired uh after cannabis they

33
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,040
can pull them over they can do a number

34
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,879
of roadside tests then they can take

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,600
them back to a lab to to have blood

36
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,599
drawn and what we found which is coming

37
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,959
out of the literature more and more

38
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:52,478
although it's not again it's not 100%

39
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:56,000
one way or the other is that as as blood

40
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:58,399
THC goes up we don't necessarily see an

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,359
exact relationship to changes in driving

42
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,239
so we look at weaving which which is the

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,039
amount of departure from a lane which is

44
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,399
a measure that's very consistently

45
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,280
affected by cannabis and Other Drugs so

46
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,120
just how much you deviate when you're

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,560
moving in your lane so we call it

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,000
weaving the scientific term is standard

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,759
deviation of lateral position so we

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,120
looked at that and tried to see how that

51
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:22,759
relates to blood

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,560
THC and we didn't see that there was a

53
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,639
clear relationship so as blood THC

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,000
levels went up we didn't necessarily see

55
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,719
an exact correspondence of changes and

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,479
driving some people were impaired at

57
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,639
higher levels of blood THC others

58
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,158
weren't there wasn't an exact

59
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,119
relationship but if we sort of broke it

60
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,959
down by the five nanogram per Mill

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,560
threshold and looked at those who were

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,158
above versus those who were below we

63
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,318
found that those two groups were

64
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:52,280
different so there seems to be some

65
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:55,359
Merit in those limits that we do seem to

66
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,199
be detecting um some measure of

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,840
impairment although I have to put the

68
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,359
caveat in there that that was just for

69
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,640
smoked cannabis we may see differences

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,640
with Edibles or other roots of

71
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,709
