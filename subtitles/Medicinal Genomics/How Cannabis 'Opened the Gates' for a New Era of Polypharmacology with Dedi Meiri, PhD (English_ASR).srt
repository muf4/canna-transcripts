first conference back since the pandemic

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,160
no it's my third in the last three

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,439
months but it's for sure

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,000
the first day cannabis conference and

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,439
meeting all the friends here literally

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,320
it's

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,280
something that i missed and uh it's it's

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,640
amazing feeling face to face yeah and so

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,079
when you come to events like this you

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
know what are you trying to get out of

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,359
it is it just catching up with with

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,479
colleagues or

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,839
trying to see what the latest

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,519
innovations are what's what's the

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,440
biggest takeaway for you

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,440
i think it's all together first of all

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,079
it's a good opportunity to sit and

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,878
listen and learn

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,439
and

26
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,718
hear hear new

27
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,640
things

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,040
second is the

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,359
communication between you know

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,439
colleagues and then people

31
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,478
and we learned in the last two years

32
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,478
that it's

33
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,400
far from being the same

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,599
with zoom soaring

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,240
far away

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,478
here you like you finish the talk you

37
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,280
asking questions and then you getting

38
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:25,679
out you have another half an hour chat

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,239
about this and that and that small talks

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,759
and this is building their relationship

41
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,078
this is building

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
you know collaboration and it's

43
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,759
extremely important

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,359
absolutely um and you talked about the

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,040
presentations are there any in

46
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,200
particular at this year's canmed that

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,000
you're looking forward to

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,560
yeah there was there are a few that i'm

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,879
a big fan of them you know the regular

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,799
one but

51
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,879
also stacy gruber which i really a

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,840
big fan of her work and i think she's

53
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,199
going to present few new things

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,600
but they

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,159
don't understand me wrong mainly the you

56
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,280
know the the new science

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,599
there is a lot of fame

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,640
talks in these types of conference which

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,238
giving

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,639
big view about you know the

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,840
endocannabinoid system that this is

62
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,919
enough for me already yeah okay now

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,598
the details and and some of them i can

64
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,000
repeat the the talk by myself

65
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,759
but the new people the the people that

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
really showing new science and

67
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,318
unpublished downtime that is extremely

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,879
interesting for me yeah and you

69
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,318
mentioned stacy gruber um and there i

70
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,120
know that there are others here at kamed

71
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,039
that are presenting more clinical trials

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
which i know is sort of the gold

73
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,239
standard in terms of data when looking

74
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
at

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,719
medical cannabis

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,840
so yes

77
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,519
in the last

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,120
i would say

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,480
three years there is

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,319
a lot of

81
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,439
studying mature to be a real clinical

82
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,518
trial

83
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,759
and not the kind of clinical trials that

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,959
we were speaking

85
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,158
few years ago that is more observative

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,400
trials

87
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,878
we gave cannabis we see that this effect

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,760
and that effect these are real clinical

89
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,639
trials double-blind placebo we start

90
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,359
that

91
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,679
also the pharma or you know i would say

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,599
the physician will admire i think it's

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
extremely important it's

94
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,280
it's opened

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,640
the gate to

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,479
new

97
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,039
um

98
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,919
population new

99
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,798
types of patients that we willing to use

100
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,479
and try when we cross this barrier yeah

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,560
i think it's extremely important and

102
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,878
interesting absolutely

103
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,640
okay so your presentation is titled the

104
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,039
challenges in bridging the gap between

105
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,439
traditional and modern medicine in the

106
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,079
medicinal cannabis arena

107
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,438
it's a lot to unpack there but um first

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,519
could you describe the difference

109
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,359
between traditional and modern medicine

110
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,759
like what do you mean by that yeah so

111
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,920
that's exactly what i we just said about

112
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,560
the clinical trial you know there is a

113
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,958
difference between using a herb and

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,560
saying you know that the chinese believe

115
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,598
that it's good for that and that and

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,840
this is

117
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,399
traditional traditional is you know

118
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,600
drinking drinking drinking a baboon egg

119
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,399
and said it's good for stomach aches or

120
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,639
taking a henitia or other

121
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,679
ginseng and said this is good for that

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,840
and that

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,639
modern

124
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,159
it's

125
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,720
proven

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,439
facts okay like you're doing clinical

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,360
trials you know what is the molecules

128
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,519
you know what the mechanism of action

129
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,520
why it's doing that what are the side

130
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,599
effects what are the benefits and what

131
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,478
you're losing it's always

132
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,639
you know kind of of a balance

133
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:54,159
and and this is what we call modern okay

134
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,400
in in the last 100 years most of the i

135
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,960
will call it modern or pharma

136
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:03,519
was single molecules to single target

137
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,159
and plants are never a single molecule

138
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,599
single target it's more complicated

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,039
and think the pharma and the science

140
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,240
and physician

141
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,839
was afraid about this complexity of

142
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,759
molecules

143
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,079
what's happened in the last 20 years we

144
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,199
called it polypharmacology when more

145
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,120
than one compound showing an effect

146
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,360
combination

147
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,038
and what's happened in last 20 years is

148
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,879
computer

149
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,399
arrived in science

150
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,478
today to look on network of you know few

151
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,478
thousand

152
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,439
proteins molecules

153
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,680
people

154
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,199
are doing something it's something that

155
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,600
look to us

156
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,879
already kind of trivially right

157
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,360
networking of we use it for everything

158
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,519
also in medicine what looks very

159
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,038
complicated to look on three molecules

160
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,519
what they are doing

161
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,000
today it's not an excel file right three

162
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,000
molecules this is not a big

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,839
bioinformatic this

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,478
so this is a huge change to look on

165
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,719
complicated

166
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,318
action what we called in the cannabis

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
entourage effect

168
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,879
but what the meaning of that this is

169
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:17,038
polypharmacology few molecules are doing

170
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,879
a complicated effect

171
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,439
today with the ability the science

172
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,639
availability analytical ability in

173
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,639
computer

174
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,199
bioinformatics

175
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,478
it's not a border anymore we can cross

176
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,120
it easily

177
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,639
and this is what i think you know

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,079
bridging

179
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,439
the modern medicine with the traditional

180
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,599
one

181
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,079
right so it's using modern tools to

182
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
really be able to find the benefits or

183
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,959
the values

184
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,478
um that sort of the traditional

185
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,079
medicines were using where it was more

186
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,478
kind of herbal based right in less

187
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,918
single single compound exactly think

188
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,279
about the the the traditional physician

189
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:56,959
four thousand years ago or three

190
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,439
thousand years ago you come with

191
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,758
inflammation wouldn't give you a pill

192
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,800
with one compound right he will give you

193
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,680
a leaf

194
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
with a road with a root with a you know

195
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,360
another flower combine them together and

196
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,799
giving you would do what i call

197
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,720
polypharmacology will take actually a

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,639
few compounds from here three compounds

199
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,800
from here a few components from here it

200
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,038
didn't really take them but he combined

201
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,319
them together and give you something

202
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,959
complicated

203
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,598
maybe a lot of that's placebo but a lot

204
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,279
of that it's knowledge that accumulate

205
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,759
you know you combine this and this and

206
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,399
the patient die okay this is not good

207
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,879
until he found what is helping right

208
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,000
this is thousands of years that

209
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,000
accumulating data that in the last 100

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,478
years we put them aside okay this is too

211
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,120
complicated let's take the simplest one

212
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,839
but there are many diseases

213
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,918
neurodegenerative diseases like

214
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,159
alzheimer's als

215
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,799
cancer diseases other diseases that we

216
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,080
are

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,639
hitting our head to the wall for

218
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,318
many years doesn't matter how many

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,680
billions of dollars we're pouring on

220
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,759
that and we didn't find the compound the

221
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,959
single compounded doing that right and i

222
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,560
believe that the next generation of

223
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,839
of you know

224
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,800
medicines will come from complicate

225
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,878
and medicines cannabis is open the gate

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
for that in amazing way it's a

227
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,120
complicated plant with hundreds of

228
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
molecules that working in the synergism

229
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,519
or

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,918
with the you know

231
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,120
entourage effect with the you know

232
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,120
different

233
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
receptors hitting different receptors

234
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,158
and

235
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,120
and it's just open the window and the

236
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,399
gate to understand that plant medicinal

237
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,959
plants

238
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,799
are like that and today we have the

239
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,039
tools to

240
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,719
to deal with that yes so cannabis

241
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,319
brought money

242
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,639
and the concept

243
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
to build labs like my own at the

244
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,759
technion

245
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,519
and but other labs that have the ability

246
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,480
today to take a plant

247
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,399
to look

248
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,800
doing what we call metabolomics to look

249
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,320
on all the active compounds

250
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:06,240
to test them on different diseases to to

251
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,879
analyze the compounds to understand the

252
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
mechanism of action exactly what we did

253
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,958
with cannabis we can do with other

254
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,720
plants there is a lot to do still with

255
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,039
cannabis but i think

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
it's bigger than cannabis it's open and

257
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,838
window and gate

258
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,919
to bridge

259
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,600
the traditional medicine

260
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,199
the

261
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,240
yeah so

262
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,399
are you saying there could be some

263
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,680
opportunity to kind of look at you know

264
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,519
more

265
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,879
established medicinal plants that maybe

266
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,399
we have gotten some of those single

267
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,399
molecule compounds that have been

268
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,000
effective like let's go back and look at

269
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,360
are there other compounds in here that

270
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
we could have been missing or that could

271
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,959
have been

272
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,600
having some kind of synergistic effect

273
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,399
yes that's what i'm doing for my you

274
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,278
know

275
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,360
this is what i'm doing back home yeah so

276
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,159
my lab is not working just on cannabis

277
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,360
we are i have three phd students working

278
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:00,240
on algae and other plants

279
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,039
that we think are

280
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,519
important medicinal plants that were too

281
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,519
complicated and now we can break it down

282
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,560
and understand

283
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,879
why it's working and and so on so

284
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,719
cannabis is still very important you

285
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,639
know it's hitting the endocannabinoid

286
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,879
system that it's all over our body and

287
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,799
there is a lot to do and it's a very

288
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,720
unique special plant

289
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,879
but for sure there are

290
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,759
many other plants that we can benefit

291
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,838
from

292
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,480
the techniques and the knowledge that we

293
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,880
learn from cannabis to other plants

294
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,560
interesting now one of the

295
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,000
plants that's gotten a lot of attention

296
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,359
lately is

297
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,679
um psychoactive mushrooms silasippy or

298
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,360
other psilocybin-producing mushrooms are

299
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,199
you investigating that at all

300
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,919
yeah sure like part of my my lab and my

301
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,000
company is doing that it's the same idea

302
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,679
for me you know

303
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
first of all

304
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,958
seven years ago people said cannabis

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,839
states in cbd right yep

306
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:04,239
and it's the same thing as you said you

307
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,959
know psychedelic mushrooms or magic

308
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,320
mushrooms cellulosurbin mushrooms

309
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,559
what do you mean

310
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,200
sorbet mushrooms like to say thc

311
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,799
cannabis it's one molecules

312
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,320
so there are

313
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:21,679
in my lab only i have 135 different

314
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,959
types of cytosol mushrooms 11 different

315
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,159
families of

316
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,838
mushrooms

317
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,759
every one of them contain different

318
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,079
combination of active compound cell

319
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,278
sorbin it's one of them xylocytosol

320
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:32,879
cytosomia

321
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,439
but there is

322
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,360
we can recognize more than 70 molecules

323
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,200
from this family already

324
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,919
the combination is doing totally

325
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,000
different effects the heating specific

326
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,319
receptors like the cannabis is heating

327
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,600
the endocannabinoid system they are

328
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,240
heating the serotonin system you know

329
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,079
485 hd and all the family

330
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
and so on and so on so it's the same

331
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,399
idea

332
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,000
is cannabis

333
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,958
exactly we have a good idea that it's

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,639
very powerfully work on our body right

335
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,559
if you're taking two grams and you think

336
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,600
you're a dolphin it's probably powerful

337
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,278
right

338
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,560
and

339
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:16,799
and i understand where these

340
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,799
receptors are in our bodies so which

341
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,159
which

342
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,559
diseases it i can aim and and so and so

343
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,519
