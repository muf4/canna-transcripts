20th through 22nd on this episode we get

9
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,379
the chance to talk with our first

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,079
representative from the safety focus

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,630
area in yah Thea is the scientific

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,460
director at canna SAF labs one of the

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,039
largest cannabis testing labs in

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,320
California if you aren't familiar with

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,239
what exactly goes on at a cannabis

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,189
testing lab you're likely in the

17
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,530
majority as I mentioned in my

18
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,718
conversation with any the cannabis

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,600
testing labs are sort of like the unsung

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,518
heroes of the cannabis industry they

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,980
serve a very important role in ensuring

22
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:08,009
consumer and patient safety but they

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,760
rarely get recognized for it during our

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,950
conversation

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,140
Annie and I discussed the types of tests

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,790
labs perform in California what

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,829
challenges they face being in a

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,380
regulated market and how they balance

29
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:22,469
keeping customers happy with also

30
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,479
keeping consumers safe so by the end of

31
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:26,730
this episode you will hopefully have a

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,730
much better appreciation for cannabis

33
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,650
testing labs we also get into the

34
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,870
testing any has performed on the

35
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,530
ingredients in vaporizer cartridges in

36
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,150
the wake of last year's vaping crisis

37
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,219

00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:56,120
hey any thanks for joining me today

85
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,530
thank you for having me absolutely I'm

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,550
really excited to have a conversation

87
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,500
with you today because you come from the

88
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,350
testing side of the cannabis industry

89
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,819
and we deal a lot with the with the

90
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:10,819
testing labs here on the medicinal

91
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:12,379
genomics side and I hope you don't mind

92
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,969
me saying but I really feel like the

93
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,819
testing labs are sort of the unsung

94
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:18,949
heroes of the cannabis industry and I

95
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:21,379
was just telling ya a good bit and I was

96
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:23,089
just telling a colleague earlier that to

97
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:25,639
use a football analogy I feel like you

98
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:28,279
guys are like the offensive line of the

99
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,439
cannabis industry which unfortunately

100
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,539
means that if you're doing everything

101
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:35,180
right we don't hear about you guys a lot

102
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,610
but fortunately when when things go

103
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,569
wrong that's when we hear about the

104
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,670
testing labs which i think is really

105
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,839
unfortunate did you guys do a lot of

106
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,030
great where it can have a lot of great

107
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:47,769
contributions to the cannabis industry

108
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:52,399
but do you feel like my analogy is apt

109
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:55,459
it's absolutely spot-on you know it's

110
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:58,069
easy to pick at the negatives when

111
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:01,729
things do go wrong but forget all the

112
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:04,269
positive and here long hard work that we

113
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:07,460
put in to ensure consumer safety

114
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:09,319
absolutely and I first some context any

115
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:11,959
it is of course the scientific director

116
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:16,339
at canna save labs out there in

117
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:17,899
California and there's a lot of there's

118
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:19,189
a lot of cannabis labs out there in

119
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,509
California I think I was reading an

120
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:23,930
article that said there's there's about

121
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:25,730
33 licensed labs in California so it

122
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,040
seems like a pretty pretty competitive

123
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,939
market out there how do you guys guys

124
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:36,379
navigate that yes definitely

125
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:38,230
probably a lot more now you know Cantus

126
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:42,259
aid isn't a lab that just began

127
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:44,509
yesterday we've been the business for

128
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,899
quite some time now on the third was a

129
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:52,279
smaller lab being the first lab to be

130
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:55,459
ISO 17025 accredited in cannabis sort of

131
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,289
sets us apart and we simply took off

132
00:05:55,459 --> 00:06:00,889
from there and continuing down that path

133
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:04,310
of you know being the go-to lab in the

134
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:07,459
space or being the industry tiny

135
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:10,790
so the name the branding itself is sort

136
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:12,319
of I guess you could say sets us apart

137
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,210
you know when you think of going to the

138
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,129
store you can think of Target Walgreens

139
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:18,949
although there are many other drugs or

140
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:22,519
she could go to but apart from that

141
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:24,229
we've upheld the scientific excellent in

142
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:29,389
the industry and we've been on the

143
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:32,800
forefront of every breaking news and and

144
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:35,060
and whatnot and new mekin development

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,970
you know that's allowed us essentially

146
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,930
be able to keep the market share

147
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,750
excellent then you mentioned you were

148
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,579
the first ISO certified lab in the

149
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,670
cannabis space

150
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:48,050
lettre yes back in of about 2011 yes we

151
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,990
were the ISO 17025

152
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,819
first item to notify created lab in

153
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,189
cannabis you know calling up the

154
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,920
creating body and saying hey we want to

155
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:59,959
get a credit for cannabis wasn't an easy

156
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,060
easy feed you know they just kind of

157
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,889
laughed like really and this illegal

158
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,850
stuff I mean given that I wasn't we

159
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:09,409
counted at the time but just being able

160
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,680
to eventually get that accreditation

161
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,740
kind of paved the way for even that

162
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,269
industry to realize hey there's another

163
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,180
sort of niche here that we could tackle

164
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:23,889
and and and kind of it helps legitimize

165
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:27,290
the whole industry yeah I was gonna ask

166
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,509
what that conversation was like being

167
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,850
the Pharaoh oh yeah you know from what

168
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:35,120
I've heard they pretty much laughed at

169
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,730
the call hi what you wanna steal credit

170
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,199
credit cannabis what did what do you

171
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,330
mean you know at that point it was

172
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,930
mostly potency and a couple of

173
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:48,079
contaminant assays and canapes in in

174
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,439
Murrieta California was owned by you

175
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:54,409
know well respected sciences and and he

176
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,149
wanted to help legitimizing business

177
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,000
industry from the beginning

178
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:01,129
eventually the creating body called us

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,649
back and decided to give it a shot after

180
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:06,079
some convincing that the lab is a

181
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,689
legitimate lab and not just you know

182
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:13,159
another cannabis storefront or something

183
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:17,300
so what's a typical day like a can a

184
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,280
safe labs oh well

185
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,129
you know you come in and hit the ground

186
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,869
running Janice's labs being you know the

187
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,610
number one market shareholder in the

188
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:30,649
space it's very busy

189
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:33,320
we have a variety of staff groups I mean

190
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:37,098
from our marketing to Account Executive

191
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,200
to the samplers with a fleet of car and

192
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:43,430
then of course the lab staff there's

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:47,839
admin staff we employ over 150 people in

194
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:50,659
this space so it's quite busy so you're

195
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,450
constantly going around making sure that

196
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:55,219
this machine is well-oiled machine is

197
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,149
running smoothly of course that's not

198
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,660
always the case

199
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:02,389
with any business but we put people in

200
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:03,799
strategic position to make sure that

201
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:06,379
everything's being communicate

202
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:07,789
effectively and of course our customers

203
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:11,509
come first so we have a huge customer

204
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:13,278
service team that we are constantly in

205
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:16,490
contact with to make sure they are

206
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,289
getting their needs met and I sort of

207
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,730
you know bouncing between all those

208
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:26,708
areas to make sure that you know

209
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:29,180
whatever wherever I meet it I'm there

210
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:31,609
excellent so how many samples do you

211
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:35,359
guys manage the process with you know

212
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:38,389
150 people working what I imagine is

213
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,919
probably around the clock yeah we're

214
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:42,679
pretty much working around the clock and

215
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:46,189
I mean up all of those 150 people

216
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:48,139
probably about half of them are actual

217
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,950
analytical lab staff and the rest are

218
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:55,429
cells and other ancillary positions but

219
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:57,680
you know it's we know without giving up

220
00:09:55,429 --> 00:10:00,229
the exact number it's quite a bit we're

221
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,958
in the hundreds well anywhere from 100

222
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,159
to 200 samples a day yeah and then you

223
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,619
mentioned when you guys first started

224
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,120
that it was mostly potency and a few

225
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,980
contaminants but I know that the

226
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,740
regulations in California have gotten

227
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,778
quite more stringent since then so what

228
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,829
is sort of the battery of tests that an

229
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:23,179
average sample needs to go through oh

230
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:26,569
yeah so of course back in early 2000

231
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:29,569
yeah it was really no regulations up

232
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,070
until about two three years ago when the

233
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,278
real regs

234
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:37,540
with creation of the DCC and and

235
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,948
Lucretia but we're talking about potency

236
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:41,689
pesticides

237
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:44,838
terpenes if appropriate the contaminant

238
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,310
assay such as heavy metals microbial and

239
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,069
when we're talking about micro we're

240
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:52,818
talking about that a specialist species

241
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:57,019
a sugar toxin producing e.coli and

242
00:10:52,818 --> 00:11:00,019
pathogenic Salmonella there's water

243
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:03,528
activity tests and also moisture on

244
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:05,240
flour residual solvents as well so a

245
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:08,179
typical flour would have to go through

246
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,028
essentially those complete battery of

247
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:13,208
cat and have to pass the stringent limit

248
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:16,730
to be able to be put on the market

249
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:18,828
excellent and what percentage give or

250
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,259
take do you think actually gets through

251
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:25,399
and gets to the Shelf how many samples

252
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:27,079
are you are failing well you know it's

253
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,528
funny cuz we've been doing some trending

254
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:32,899
data which we'll be putting out shortly

255
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:35,208
we've already put some out but looking

256
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,309
back at the canna save as it exists

257
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:39,888
today in LA when it was open back in the

258
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:42,649
beginning of June January of 2018 or so

259
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:44,120
and you know about a quarter of the

260
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,399
product I were coming through him or

261
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,980
were failing for a lot of exercise and

262
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,360
and whatnot so it was a learning period

263
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:56,120
for people who had to now come into the

264
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,278
light and and learn to deal with this

265
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,560
regulation they had to learn which

266
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:03,439
decides not to use and how to grow

267
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:08,568
without them so products were selling

268
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:12,440
about 1/4 to 1/3 but recently you know

269
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:14,659
not an exact figure but there's about 10

270
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,829
percent failure rate for you know the

271
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:21,740
various assays so the manufacturers have

272
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:24,938
really learned an upper game to be able

273
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,818
to grow cleanly without pesticides or

274
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:31,009
pathogenic organisms and also without

275
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:34,429
introducing things like heavy metals

276
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:38,360
which generally bait cars would fail for

277
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:40,219
mostly because of hardware well so

278
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,800
that's great so that things are trending

279
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,750
in the right direction the manufacturers

280
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,979
are getting better it's good to hear

281
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,299
yeah the manufacturers are definitely

282
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,180
getting better you know we've been

283
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,699
leading that effort in education making

284
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:56,459
sure that you know instead of just

285
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,140
failing somebody we're helping educate

286
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,790
the whole community will have educating

287
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:04,710
our clients how to better produce clean

288
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:06,779
products and avoid some of the pitfalls

289
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:10,530
we've seen yeah I'm glad you mentioned

290
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:12,209
education because if anyone follows can

291
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:14,699
a safe on social media you'll see that

292
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:17,129
you guys are very dedicated to to

293
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,259
educating the market on you know whether

294
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,750
it be testing or just the science behind

295
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,980
cannabis and its really great follow so

296
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,379
if you're not following canna sakes

297
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,940
definitely definitely do that because

298
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:30,240
you guys are putting on some great

299
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,160
content yes sir thank you very much for

300
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,919
that yeah we've been making sure that

301
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,569
our community we have a very big social

302
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,819
media presence element ensure that

303
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,040
community is well informed

304
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,420
after all the regulations do not work is

305
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,299
people are not following them or people

306
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,620
don't know what to look for making sure

307
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:48,839
you're educated about you know asking

308
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,460
about certificate of analysis and what

309
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,320
sort of contaminants should you be

310
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,000
looking for in your canvas products you

311
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,910
know especially for people with certain

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,490
conditions who should not be ingesting

313
00:13:55,909 --> 00:14:01,649
certain contaminants so just making sure

314
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,320
that a well that you're well informed

315
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:06,389
consumer not just a consumer but the

316
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,910
manufacturers like I spoke on before I

317
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:12,419
think it's a very important aspect of

318
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:15,059
this community in that in order to let

319
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,919
you know in our for all boats to rise in

320
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,799
the tide and come into the light we have

321
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,949
to be well informed yeah I think that's

322
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,169
so right and and as far as educating in

323
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,910
the consumer you I mean we have to

324
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:29,219
remember that a lot of these consumers

325
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:31,919
aren't just consumers their patients and

326
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,879
like you alluded to there's certain

327
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,500
considerations they need to to take

328
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,570
whether they're immunocompromised or

329
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,820
have some other vulnerabilities that

330
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,560
they need to really be aware of what's

331
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,460
in their product and make sure that it's

332
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,989
tested and performing in the right way

333
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,400
yes indeed and you know there's

334
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,830
something I strongly believe in and that

335
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,449
all labs in this industry all kind of as

336
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:57,060
lab should be joining efforts to make

337
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,660
sure the consumer is protected to make

338
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,750
sure that

339
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:03,299
we are all on the up and it's very

340
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,950
important like you mentioned for

341
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,919
immunocompromised individuals who are

342
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:12,870
using this for cancer therapy or whatnot

343
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:14,069
you know you when you ingest cannabis

344
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,470
there's different routes of

345
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,060
administration so while some of this

346
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,149
contaminants may be higher level in

347
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:24,029
other food products I chances are you're

348
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:25,860
inhaling certain chemicals and you know

349
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,379
that not enough has been studied about

350
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,789
it to be able to speak on whether that

351
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:31,950
rat administration is more detrimental

352
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:34,500
or not but one thing we know for a fact

353
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,570
is if it's not going to register system

354
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,389
chances are it is more detrimental data

355
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:42,690
then not so it's important that people

356
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:45,120
are aware of that yeah especially when

357
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,520
so much of the the narrative that's out

358
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,440
there about cannabis is how its how safe

359
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,490
it is because when you're really looking

360
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,920
at you know THC or CBD and how there's

361
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,690
never really been an overdose of these

362
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,759
compounds you assume that

363
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,550
oh it's safe I don't need to worry about

364
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,990
it but like you said there are these

365
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,879
additional contaminants that could be

366
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,820
present that you really need to be aware

367
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:14,159
of and that's why labs like yours are so

368
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:16,170
important yes indeed absolutely and one

369
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,449
of the things that was recently in the

370
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:20,069
news

371
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:23,550
was the whole issue with with the vape

372
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:27,000
crisis or the veep situation and I know

373
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:28,919
that you and the folks at canna c4 doing

374
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,340
some research into that I was hoping

375
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:35,009
that you could share what you found yeah

376
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,930
you know when the vade crisis broke we

377
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:40,049
jumped on it because there was a big

378
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:42,539
consumer concern people were coming to

379
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:45,029
our say what do you suggest where can we

380
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:48,839
go what do we do so we jumped right on

381
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:51,059
it to continue to instill that consumer

382
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,620
confidence in the industry and make sure

383
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:56,759
that the whole industry is not taken

384
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:59,159
down by a few bad actors and you know we

385
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,049
went in to the quote-unquote black

386
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,610
market and purchased product and started

387
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:04,589
doing the testing ourselves before the

388
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,269
CDC was able to verify that it was

389
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,939
vitamin you have to say you know I

390
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:10,710
quickly jumped on instruments and

391
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,150
developed the assay to look for vitamin

392
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,200
yeah

393
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:17,210
it you know it was quite surprising

394
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,569
quickly finding out in our first set of

395
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:22,279
assays that first set of testing that

396
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:25,220
there were huge levels of vitamin E and

397
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:27,399
E acetate in this product over 50% in

398
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,740
some cases so people were just

399
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,000
unscrupulously cutting the product with

400
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,150
just you know

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,269
thickening agent or whatnot and not only

402
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,610
that but there were high levels of

403
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:44,059
several pesticide along with you know

404
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:46,129
not actually meeting labeled THC claimed

405
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:48,679
most of these products were labeled 80

406
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,400
to 90 percent THC but you only found

407
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,529
that they contain about 10 to 20% while

408
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,180
the majority of it was vitamin D acetate

409
00:17:54,529 --> 00:18:02,529
and other cutting agent and contaminant

410
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:05,690
well yeah that's that's certainly scary

411
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:07,910
yeah and you know it was really

412
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:10,039
unfortunate after that first set of

413
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,140
acids we really decided to dig a little

414
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:15,289
deeper and go into what else

415
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,730
may we be able to find in these illicit

416
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:20,809
products and actually compare them to

417
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,789
legal product as well and we looked at

418
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,619
things like some other cutting agent or

419
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:27,139
you know what they set of temperatures

420
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:31,279
and flavors and even other contaminants

421
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:36,080
such as metals running more of a full

422
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:38,240
scan type of study onto what other what

423
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,009
you would refer to as a harmful or

424
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,099
potentially harmful contaminants such as

425
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:44,420
carbonyls so we did a lot of work on

426
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:47,779
that I don't know these indicate they're

427
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,850
out there yeah I did get a chance to

428
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:52,759
review it before we before we jumped on

429
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:55,129
the call here but I mean I guess it's it

430
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:56,750
shouldn't be a huge surprise that you

431
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,730
know the black market products not going

432
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,849
to be as safe as things that are going

433
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,759
through your lab but I mean especially

434
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:08,779
with the with the vape cartridges it

435
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:12,829
being sort of a a newer form of a newer

436
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:14,269
delivery system for the product it's

437
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:15,740
certainly introducing a lot more

438
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:19,639
variables a lot more dangerous

439
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,349
contaminants consumer you mean you're

440
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,020
completely right it shouldn't be a

441
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:26,609
surprise honestly I do not believe that

442
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:31,500
characters that were put in this product

443
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:34,049
out there had ill intent I think it was

444
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,509
lack of information lack of research

445
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,519
lack of I don't know a scientific study

446
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:41,549
because people will be thinking oh it's

447
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,950
vitamin E of course it is useful it's a

448
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:46,319
necessary nutrient and people uses all

449
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,058
the time topically ingesting it but

450
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,849
nobody thought about the fact that hey

451
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:53,609
what about inhaling this what could it

452
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:55,289
possibly do and you know these people

453
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,899
were finding good way to cut corners of

454
00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:02,250
course they were putting humans Lyman

455
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:04,350
Allies at risk by using pesticide Laden

456
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,420
product you know but as far as the

457
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:09,869
vitamin E acetate I do not believe that

458
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,550
that was ill intent definitely the

459
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:14,699
pesticides and and and other

460
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:17,909
contaminants that were in there could be

461
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,980
seen as such yeah well another thing it

462
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,840
did was it really highlighted with

463
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,819
another thing what we probably all know

464
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:28,589
is that the black market is still out

465
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:31,169
there and still thriving and I don't

466
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:34,519
know what do we do to sort of try to

467
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:39,080
reduce that let's put you on the spot

468
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:42,480
yeah it's hard because it's more of

469
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:44,099
grayish so there's the black black

470
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,529
market quote-unquote and then there is

471
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:48,269
the auther market which are just let's

472
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:50,190
say the non-legal market these are

473
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:52,259
people who've been in the industry I've

474
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,090
been doing things right and haven't

475
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,890
acquired a license yet and have to

476
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:57,419
continue making a living right so

477
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,620
they're making great products and

478
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,350
putting it out there they just don't

479
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,639
have a PCC license or whatnot that are

480
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:04,678
probably in the process of getting that

481
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,600
license and of course there's those

482
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,710
folks that just want to do whatever they

483
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,619
can to make a quick buck in their

484
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:13,289
kitchen and cut with whatever they can

485
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:15,449
so I think you know definitely getting

486
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:16,079
people as a license as quickly as

487
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,269
possible

488
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,970
for those that are trying to get license

489
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:22,170
is key for the state to make sure that

490
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,259
that's done as efficiently as possible

491
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:28,289
and then really going after the bad

492
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:30,150
actors that are you know not in the

493
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:31,558
process of trying to get a license or

494
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:34,350
not interested in there that are just

495
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,690
cooking whatever in the kitchen you know

496
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:38,589
those bad actors have to be removed from

497
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,700
the scene

498
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:45,459
so it is tough to tackle that and sort

499
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,278
of see who to go after but I believe

500
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,700
that if the state does their best to get

501
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:53,679
people who are applying for license as

502
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,090
quickly as possible so that they can

503
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,490
come into the light and make sure that

504
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:59,439
you know they're branded well the

505
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:03,038
products are tested a company with a co

506
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,940
way it would really help the whole

507
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:09,129
industry but I think it's you know like

508
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,548
I'm saying I think it's more than just a

509
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:16,090
simple black markets more of gray areas

510
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:17,798
difference change in there yeah now it

511
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:21,250
is getting a license in California

512
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:23,379
particularly difficult I don't believe

513
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,548
it's difficult but I think there may be

514
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:29,830
some lack of efficiency in the process

515
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:32,230
in terms of how quickly people are able

516
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:34,240
to get license and even education on

517
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,519
what you need to do to get a license a

518
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,950
lot of people we found are still not

519
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,889
educated on the licensing process which

520
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,679
that's the unit to take how you know

521
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:47,980
what what municipalities are accepting

522
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,500
licenses or there is a lot of lack of

523
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,000
education out there for people being

524
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,190
able to acquire licensed licenses

525
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,490
quickly and efficiently so I think that

526
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:59,679
has to be tackled first excellent well

527
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:02,880
while we're kind of on the on the topic

528
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,370
of you know the regulated market you

529
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,850
you're your business being a testing lab

530
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:12,219
is definitely dependent on on different

531
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:14,889
regulations and we mentioned before that

532
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,009
California recently came out with with

533
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:22,570
regulations with the BCC a few years ago

534
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:24,220
where before there weren't many so what

535
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:27,700
are your feelings on sort of what you're

536
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:30,490
required to test is it is it enough

537
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,590
would you do you think it's overly

538
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,859
scrupulous kind of what are your

539
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:37,928
thoughts well you know I thoroughly

540
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:42,519
believe that regulations make the world

541
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:44,380
go around you know people may may whine

542
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,819
at speed limits but you know they're

543
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,450
there for a reason and it makes us all

544
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:50,808
safer now interestingly I joined

545
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,240
cannabis in

546
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:56,119
directly in a highly regulated market so

547
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:59,028
I joined Canada's back in about 20 2013

548
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:01,778
2014 in Nevada when they just introduced

549
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:04,369
a set of regulations that pretty much

550
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:05,509
all states are followed on afterwards

551
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:07,219
you know federal regulations

552
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:13,419
encompassing pretty much what California

553
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:17,028
has so I don't know any worse than that

554
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:22,340
you know so for me I thoroughly believe

555
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:24,048
in the current regulations there are for

556
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,970
certain things that California did a

557
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:30,528
little differently that I don't

558
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:32,960
necessarily enjoy for instance the

559
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:37,190
packaging so California says you have to

560
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,899
test product in its final packaging okay

561
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,048
that's great to keep people in line

562
00:24:38,898 --> 00:24:45,168
however what they don't realize is we're

563
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:49,099
looking at things like babe cards so you

564
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:51,710
have to acquire up about 0.35 percent of

565
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:53,118
a certain amount of bait card based on

566
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,669
batches you know that's just an estimate

567
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:57,829
but generally hundreds of cards based on

568
00:24:55,669 --> 00:25:00,288
whatever batch the manufacturers

569
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:02,148
produced so for anything if I go to pick

570
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:05,329
up a sample and the manufacturers

571
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:07,878
produce you know thousands of vape cards

572
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:09,288
I may have to pick up hundreds of the

573
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:12,308
card and I have to come into the lab and

574
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:15,109
open all of those you know these are

575
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:18,048
fused together they're metal pieces that

576
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:19,548
you have to crack open they're all in

577
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:22,849
their packaging and they're cardboard

578
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:24,740
boxes they all contain lithium batteries

579
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:27,528
or nickel bars or whatever and it's just

580
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,868
a whole amount of whole lot of waste

581
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:32,359
that happens so now you have to worry

582
00:25:29,868 --> 00:25:36,048
about recycling the batteries from the

583
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:37,758
date cards recycling the metals throwing

584
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:39,138
away the cardboard boxes you know if

585
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,210
we're caring about the environment here

586
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:44,028
this is not really the way to go about

587
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:47,929
it so we produce a ton of waste in the

588
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:50,898
lab just because we're sampling final

589
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:53,210
product packaging I think that's one

590
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:55,939
piece of legislation eyes I wish could

591
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,470
be redone in a way that you know you

592
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,570
have to track and trace it and use it

593
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,850
well so that we can sample if you're

594
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:03,950
making vape cards you have a gallons of

595
00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:04,490
oil the lab can go and sample that

596
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,039
finished

597
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:09,259
that point and do the testing and then

598
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,079
the manufacturer can still afterwards

599
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:14,240
but having them fill and then having the

600
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,909
labs and all this effort and introducing

601
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,470
all this waste you know it it's unlike

602
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,590
California so I'm surprised at that

603
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:24,579
piece of legislation Wow and that's

604
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:27,678
that's going to be a huge risk for the

605
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:29,359
manufacturer as well I mean to basically

606
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,500
go through the entire production process

607
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:35,299
of packaging everything that with the

608
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,558
reality that it can potentially fail and

609
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:40,639
you just have to scrap all of that

610
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:42,379
that's gotta be currently it happened

611
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,480
quite a bit where they've gone through a

612
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,630
testing and actually fell then you know

613
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,819
now they're having to sort of recollect

614
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,400
their products from those bodies you

615
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:53,960
know Tara boxes open up trade cars and

616
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,929
recollect the product and maybe try to

617
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:01,429
remediate it but that's why we try to

618
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:04,250
educate our clients in in R&amp;D testing

619
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,660
hey get it tested immediately so that

620
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,130
you know what you're getting into

621
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,860
did your hard work says that because

622
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,780
what has happened is you can sample that

623
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:13,669
finished product and explain and then

624
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:15,649
you stick it into some bad hardware and

625
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,840
metals are leaching into your final

626
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,880
product now so now you found out that a

627
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,339
after I packaged ten thousand eight cars

628
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:27,559
they're now all failing for lead because

629
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:29,480
you put it into untested cart so again

630
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:32,509
part of education is working with our

631
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,299
clients on making sure every piece of in

632
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:38,720
process material is tested so they can

633
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:41,210
get to a final clean product without you

634
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,410
know any surprises yeah that makes sense

635
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:47,210
and I suppose that's sort of a sort of a

636
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,980
vote for protesting that final product

637
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,200
like you said that you know once you

638
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,360
introduce it into packaging or you put

639
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,029
the oil into the vape car you could be

640
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,669
introducing some new contaminants so

641
00:27:56,029 --> 00:28:00,049
yeah I make sense it would be important

642
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,019
for the manufacturer to kind of be

643
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:04,549
testing multiple times throughout the

644
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:07,490
entire process so they can kind of

645
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:12,019
really zero in on where the potential

646
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:14,029
failure point could be it is important

647
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:15,639
that you know some manufactures may say

648
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:18,259
well why would I spend all this money

649
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,690
you know doing all those in process

650
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:23,299
thing well you think about what kind of

651
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,700
money will you be wasting to remediate

652
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:27,680
or the kind of losses you'll be taking

653
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,600
if you do sell solely it's in

654
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,860
everybody's that interest to make sure

655
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:35,299
that you type in proxy material

656
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:39,439
excellent and so you mentioned that you

657
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:40,579
you got into the cannabis space in 2013

658
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,590
what we what were you doing before

659
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:46,879
cannabis what was your pre cannabis life

660
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:50,209
like pre cannabis life I was working at

661
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,880
a few pharmaceutical companies including

662
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:55,309
Berg and Abbott Labs and life

663
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,100
technologist and right before cannabis I

664
00:28:55,309 --> 00:29:01,279
was actually in nutraceutical at a

665
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:05,000
vitamin manufacturing company in Las

666
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,399
Vegas Nevada and you know it was

667
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,660
enjoyable I guess I've always been in

668
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:15,560
this trend of I don't know what you want

669
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:17,330
to call it wellness so it was a next

670
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,829
natural jump you know yeah you know I

671
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:21,199
love to take vitamins to stay healthy

672
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:23,539
but I also recognize the benefits of

673
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,080
cannabis so I've always been in that

674
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:30,759
sort of industry and and the QC testing

675
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:33,439
part of those industries so jumping from

676
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:35,839
nutraceutical testing QC testing for

677
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,190
consumer safety to Q success in cannabis

678
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:42,859
consumer safety was right up my will if

679
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:45,500
you want to take them ya know it seems

680
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:49,549
like a logical wheel out sure gonna yeah

681
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:52,220
right up my wheelhouse right and so it's

682
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:55,700
interesting so how does the the safety

683
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:59,839
testing and QC differ in an adulterous

684
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,890
oota calor vitamin scenario as opposed

685
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,199
to cannabis like do they have

686
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,730
third-party testing labs that need to

687
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,390
test the product before it hits the

688
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:11,390
shelves in that space as well you know

689
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:14,170
it's funny because can a nutraceutical

690
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:17,810
or vitamin stage sort of a similar

691
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:22,400
problem that I think some cannabis is

692
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:24,049
now facing in that they had or let's

693
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,800
just say before before there were rules

694
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:29,509
in cannabis nutriceuticals were sort of

695
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,970
free-for-all before they became

696
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:34,940
regulated by FDA and other

697
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:36,740
and people could you know make vitamin C

698
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:40,100
in their living room have a label

699
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:42,890
printer and stick it on and sell it but

700
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:46,069
luckily the company I was working in Las

701
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:48,200
Vegas had an in-house testing lab which

702
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:50,119
is where I was working on but they also

703
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,130
send that part of a third-party testing

704
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,129
so they were doing potency and other

705
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:57,350
contaminants testing both in incoming

706
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:01,430
raw material and finished product

707
00:30:57,349 --> 00:31:03,889
so it works similarly testing for the

708
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:07,539
efficacy the potency microbials and

709
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:11,360
heavy metals not necessarily pesticides

710
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:13,369
unfortunately but it can sort of

711
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,819
interesting to see how cannabis is

712
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:18,679
involved pads what you know industries

713
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:20,569
like nutriceuticals which i've been

714
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,600
around for quite some time where they're

715
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:27,470
at now the only difference is the FDA

716
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:30,679
does audit nutraceutical companies but

717
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:32,930
they do not in Canada right obviously

718
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,620
because cannabis isn't isn't federally

719
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:39,500
legal yet exactly but how do you see the

720
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:43,459
kind of testing landscape changing if it

721
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:47,029
one that that finally does happen you

722
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,660
know I believe it will be the same set

723
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:51,049
of rules

724
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:54,790
maybe different action limits for

725
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:57,500
different analytes but it'll become

726
00:31:54,789 --> 00:32:00,769
federally regulated by the FDA you'll

727
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:03,289
now have the FDA coming in to audit your

728
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:05,359
processes not just you know whether

729
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:07,849
you're following your own SOPs but

730
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,399
making sure everything from top to

731
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:12,740
bottom you know your consumer complaints

732
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,380
and whatnot that you your marketing

733
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,299
practices I mean they audit everything

734
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,820
so I see it being a little more

735
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:23,000
stringent in that sense but as far as

736
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:25,669
what assays are actually being done they

737
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
will most likely remain the same or

738
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:32,870
similar but now do you feel like there's

739
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,759
anything that labs should be testing for

740
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,889
that they're just not testing for now

741
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,720
whether it be because it's not mandated

742
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:43,370
or the customer doesn't doesn't on it

743
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,308
mm-hmm you know

744
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:48,169
it depends which side you're looking at

745
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:50,750
because we know that cannabis contains

746
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:55,730
so many other nutrients phytonutrients

747
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:57,558
vitamins and and antioxidants it would

748
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,740
be nice to start to quantify those

749
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:02,899
things on the other end of maybe

750
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,089
contaminant assays I think it's well

751
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:09,590
covered as far as a contaminant assays

752
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:14,119
what perhaps expanding the pesticide

753
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:16,399
scope to be more open-ended you know

754
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:19,549
there are hundreds I think over 800

755
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,790
pesticides out there and you look at

756
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:24,740
California old testing 60 of them

757
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:26,509
granted there are no rules for

758
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,319
applications of any pesticides on on

759
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:31,970
cannabis and listen California but I

760
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:35,089
would like to see that expanded because

761
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:37,579
as III guess if I were a grower you're

762
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:39,230
telling me hey there is reggie's residue

763
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:41,599
limits for this 66

764
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,460
well there's hundreds more other

765
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,349
pesticide I think with maybe similar

766
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,360
functionality out there that I could use

767
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:51,230
that the labs would not be looking for

768
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:54,399
so in the end of the day in an effort to

769
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:58,519
ensure consumer safety it would be

770
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,830
better to expand that scope yeah it sort

771
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:04,400
of reminds me of that that documentary

772
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:05,359
or is it Icarus with when they're

773
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,250
they're testing for

774
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,500
performance-enhancing drugs that you

775
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,730
know as soon as you identify one you

776
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,710
come up with an assay and you start

777
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,840
testing for it then you know the

778
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:18,918
cheaters are just gonna get a choose

779
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:21,320
something else to pull the test so I'm

780
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:24,109
sure it's a cat-and-mouse game very

781
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,700
similar to the ethical of course and I

782
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,220
understand some people may not agree

783
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:30,138
with that statement my statement I was

784
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:31,459
expanding the scope but you have to

785
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,559
think about it is we're all about

786
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,840
wellness and consumer safety it should

787
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,759
not be a problem to expand that scope

788
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,860
the only people who would be really

789
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,899
worried about this are you know maybe

790
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:46,669
people who are doing someone's cooking

791
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:49,730
with things sure absolutely and you also

792
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:52,460
mentioned maybe expanding the difference

793
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,909
and ab annoyed Zoar terpenes that the

794
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,240
labs are reporting on are there any are

795
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,980
there any in particular that

796
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,229
that piqued your interest that you think

797
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,269
you know could be the next the next big

798
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,980
compound that these cultivators or

799
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:09,530
manufacturers are going to try to be

800
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:12,170
developing products around you know I

801
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:20,519
you know I know there was a recent

802
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:22,710
discovery of DHCP and or so but you know

803
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:25,099
it's such a residual levels of it it's

804
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:27,780
hard to say because they're a lot more

805
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:30,900
cannabinoids available in the plant but

806
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:34,560
there's such minut levels

807
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:38,940
it's almost inconsequential testing for

808
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:45,389
them until their efficacy is proven at a

809
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:49,679
certain level I may be more testing

810
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:53,730
around other side of nutrient so you

811
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,929
know vitamin K for example or certain

812
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,929
and camphor all some of those

813
00:35:54,929 --> 00:36:00,719
antioxidants some anthocyanins which are

814
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:03,509
definitely available especially in some

815
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:06,899
of your more colorful varieties and

816
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,690
cultivars those would be useful and

817
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,480
finding ways that we can preserve those

818
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:14,670
or different routes of extracting those

819
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,679
whether it be fresh flower or whatnot

820
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,690
but there's definitely a lot of

821
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:21,000
nutrients that are being missed by just

822
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:25,820
sticking to a certain either extraction

823
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,019
are certain mode of use as an inhaling

824
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,880
right definitely another thing that

825
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:32,090
plant has a lot more benefit to offer as

826
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,530
a fresh plant

827
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,450
absolutely and you know to bring it all

828
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,280
back to can med that's why you know

829
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:39,839
that's why we're so happy with with the

830
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,609
model that we have here because we're

831
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,920
bringing together people from all

832
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:45,750
different sides of the of the industry

833
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,670
where we have sort of the research

834
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,679
scientists who are trying to discover

835
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,079
these lesser cannabinoids or our

836
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,419
compounds to see what sort of medical

837
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,599
efficacy they could have bringing that

838
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,740
information to the physicians or the

839
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,139
healthcare professionals who are

840
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:03,719
treating the patients but also bringing

841
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:05,368
it to the cultivators who may want to

842
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,349
try to develop some new novel strains

843
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:09,720
that are going to be producing these

844
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:10,588
compounds and then folks like yourself

845
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,268
who are

846
00:37:10,588 --> 00:37:15,599
have to be developing the methods to

847
00:37:12,268 --> 00:37:17,939
either test for those or if you're more

848
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,999
on the extraction manufacturer side how

849
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,608
do we extract those those compounds out

850
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:25,259
of the plant so we like to think that

851
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:27,088
we're bringing in all the people

852
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:28,619
necessary so that we can get the most

853
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:31,228
out of this plant so we can you can

854
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,690
benefit the patients Oh certainly

855
00:37:31,228 --> 00:37:35,608
certainly and and you know last year 10

856
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:39,869
that I was really impressed with what

857
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:41,969
was happening with would I forget who

858
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:44,880
the main owner company is but I believe

859
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:47,849
roughly I'm a Coulomb is a partner in

860
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,298
that with her new discovery of sort of a

861
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:57,059
methylated cannabinoid that was found to

862
00:37:51,298 --> 00:38:00,630
be highly more efficient or or useful or

863
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:03,450
by available I shall say then I took an

864
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,219
Abba know it by itself so I see things

865
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:06,689
like that happening simply adding a

866
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:10,559
methyl group an ethyl group to the

867
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:13,108
cannabinoid allows it to penetrate the

868
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:17,640
cell better or have more bioavailability

869
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:20,940
so those are really exciting Forks that

870
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:23,699
make this industry exciting for me and

871
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,858
you know make me glad to be in this

872
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:27,778
every day and see how people are

873
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:30,328
introducing this novel ideas that are

874
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:33,650
only gonna set us further apart as a

875
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:35,579
legitimate industry and medicine

876
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,440
absolutely it's certain it's certainly

877
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,089
exciting thing to be part of when you

878
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,519
realize that we're only really

879
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:45,028
scratching the surface of what this

880
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:48,868
plant can do not even yet I mean to even

881
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:50,548
look beyond you know pharmaceutical or

882
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,769
ingesting it but when you think about

883
00:38:50,548 --> 00:38:56,849
hemp and all the possibilities that has

884
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:58,649
for you know producing textiles or or

885
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:00,539
different things like that so it's just

886
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,430
it's a really exciting thing to be a

887
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:04,979
part of and we're excited to have you

888
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:06,659
any be a part of can med this year I
