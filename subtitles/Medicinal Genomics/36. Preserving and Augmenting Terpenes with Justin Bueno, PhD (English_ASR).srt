manager at medicinal genomics and proud

00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,439
member of the team that puts on the

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,480
canmed conference

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,558
ok

11
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,640
you probably already know by now but

12
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,280
after careful evaluation of the current

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,280
situation in los angeles county and the

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,160
restrictions and requirements that would

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,439
have been necessary to hold canmed 2021

16
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,038
in september

17
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,359
our management team has made the

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,239
difficult decision to reschedule the

19
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,719
event from may 3rd through 5th

20
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,799
2022

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
this was not an easy decision to make

22
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,479
it's been almost two years since we had

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,320
a live canmed event

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,478
but everyone including the conference

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,798
organizers our sponsors and the

26
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,519
presenters strongly believe that in

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,118
order for canmed to be a success it must

28
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,879
take place in a comfortable

29
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,560
collaborative environment

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,719
and that's just not possible during

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,879
these uncomfortable and restrictive

32
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,560
times

33
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,478
so we will press on

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,640
we will continue to bring you new

35
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,560
podcasts every other week we will

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,799
continue to interact with the canmed

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,640
community on our facebook group and we

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,280
will continue to share all the great

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,239
canmed presentation videos that are in

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,400
our free searchable canmed archive on

41
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,158
all of our social media channels

alright with that news out of the way

50
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,399
let's get back to the podcast our guest

51
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,799
this episode is justin bueno

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,598
justin is the scientific director of

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,120
goodness growth holdings inc and since

54
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,439
joining the company in 2018 dr bueno has

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,520
published two peer-reviewed articles in

56
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,919
the field of cannabis science

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,319
one article published in the journal of

58
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,878
cannabis research described the

59
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,919
validation and the science behind the

60
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,000
novel terp safe packaging system

61
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,399
towards the preservation of terpenes in

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
cannabis flower

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,599
that article will be the basis for his

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,400
presentation at canmed 2022

65
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:45,759
titled the preservation and augmentation

66
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,080
of terpenes and cannabis inflorescence

67
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,120
my conversation with dr bueno is all

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,120
about terpenes including how terpenes

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,560
contribute to cannabis effects in

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
overall quality

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,680
why using thc potency as an indicator of

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,519
quality is short-sighted

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,120
the difference between terpenes and

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,039
terpenoids

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,759
how the terpene profile of cannabis

76
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,959
flower can change over time as molecules

77
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,959
evaporate

78
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,199
the inconsistency of terpene

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,598
concentrations from flower to flower

80
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,158
within the same batch

81
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,479
and how the new terp safe technology is

82
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,399
addressing terpene preservation and

83
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,158
batch consistency

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
before we get to my conversation with

85
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,120

97
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,039
good morning justin thanks for joining

98
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,920
us on the podcast

99
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,759
hey ben thank you so much for having me

100
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,159
all right i'm excited to talk with you

101
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,319
today about a topic that i'll admit i

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,400
have a bit of a love-hate relationship

103
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,360
with and that's terpenes

104
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,758
i say that because i think terpenes are

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
are truly fascinating compounds for

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,919
reasons i know that we're going to get

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,079
into in this conversation but i still

108
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,399
feel like the average consumer out there

109
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,439
is very unaware of terpenes has that

110
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,638
been your experience as well

111
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,600
oh absolutely

112
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
um

113
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,439
you know there's a focus right now in

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,960
the cannabis industry to look at thc

115
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,240
content which is obviously critically

116
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,439
important

117
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,639
but

118
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,639
terpenes are relatively

119
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,160
under considered when looking at the

120
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,519
whole phytochemical composition

121
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
especially for

122
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,198
newer patients

123
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,879
as markets are continuing to

124
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
open up for both

125
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,959
medicinal and recreational applications

126
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,560
as additional legislation is passing

127
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,000
there's an increased increase in the

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,038
patient base

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,639
and

130
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,560
to your point

131
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,120
with this increase in patient base we

132
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,800
also need to improve patient education

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,478
and talk about

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,680
different phytochemicals in the plant

135
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,680
outside of cannabinoids

136
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,360
yeah and it's interesting you say that

137
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,198
because i just recently saw an article i

138
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,720
think it was on weed maps and maybe i'll

139
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,720
put a link in the show description so

140
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
people can read it as well

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
and it was all about

142
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,759
the author was making the case that we

143
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,959
need to kind of break this idea that the

144
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,160
highest

145
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,560
potency the high or the highest thc

146
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
cannabis flower is the best quality

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,120
cannabis flower and that you know that's

148
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,960
only looking at this one cannabinoid one

149
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,199
specific cannabinoid where you should

150
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,959
really be looking at the full breadth of

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,199
the other cannabinoids and of course the

152
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,799
terpenes as well to really gauge your

153
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,560
quality or the experience that you're

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
having with that so

155
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,759
um would you agree that the industry is

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,280
still really kind of stuck in that

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,800
thc

158
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,959
potency number more than anything else

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
yeah it's a great point and you can kind

160
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,038
of understand where

161
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,560
this tribe originates from so if a

162
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,639
patient's at a dispensary looking at

163
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,839
different label claims for cannabis

164
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,600
flour or

165
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,839
extract products

166
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,400
if they see a higher thc reported value

167
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,079
for one product they associate that with

168
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,159
improved efficacy for treating their

169
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,560
disease state you know if it's

170
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,720
looking at pain management or a variety

171
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,720
of other conditions

172
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
you can see where

173
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,160
you know they'd make the correlation

174
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,359
with higher thc content improved

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,880
efficacy

176
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,160
but uh you know to what i talked about

177
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,478
previously

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,720
um you know the whole

179
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:01,519
phytochemical composition of the plant

180
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,680
really contributes to this efficacy

181
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,719
across treating a variety of disease

182
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
states

183
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,599
and when you talk about product quality

184
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,840
that's a really interesting

185
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,759
attribute because especially experienced

186
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,119
cannabis users

187
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,720
when we're talking about flour

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,439
specifically

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,919
really associate the aroma

190
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,199
and flavor of cannabis with product

191
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,279
quality

192
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
and as we can get into

193
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,239
we know that terpenes are the main

194
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:33,120
driving force behind this characteristic

195
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,720
aroma and flavor of cannabis flower

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,680
so terpene content is critically

197
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,479
important

198
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,478
for

199
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,360
both the perceived or actual product

200
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,478
quality and

201
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,639
as

202
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,560
research has shown there's also

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,800
interesting medicinal

204
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,839
recreational and what we can talk about

205
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
entourage effects

206
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,318
associated with terpene content and

207
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,160
terpene profiles

208
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,080
yeah it's a great point and another

209
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,639
point that was made in this article was

210
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,359
this idea that

211
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,519
the

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,038
the chemo type information for a

213
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,359
cannabis flower it's all based on

214
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:13,199
percent right so if you're if you have a

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,598
very high percentage of thc then

216
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,840
it makes sense to think that you're

217
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,839
going to have a lower percentage of

218
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,038
those terpenes so even though you might

219
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,719
have a high thc flower it might be

220
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:28,000
relatively lower

221
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,360
in those beneficial terpenes for quality

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,759
aroma or even effect

223
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,519
yeah it's a great point so

224
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,278
there's a couple interesting discussion

225
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:42,158
points around this question first

226
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:45,439
cannabinoids and terpenes

227
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,480
have shared biosynthetic pathways in the

228
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
plant

229
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,320
so

230
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,838
at some stage there's a precursor that

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,720
has to be

232
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,640
it can only be sent towards synthesizing

233
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
a cannabinoid or synthesizing for

234
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,759
example a mono terpene so there may be

235
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,278
some type of competition there where

236
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,159
depending upon what the plant wants to

237
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,159
make

238
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,480
you may drive cannabinoid production

239
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,079
which would relatively reduce

240
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,440
terpene content

241
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,920
so that would be one

242
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,320
uh hypothesis

243
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,240
to look at that relationship however

244
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
kind of in my role at goodness growth

245
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
holdings

246
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,559
we do some interesting

247
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,480
fundamental r d on the cannabis plant

248
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,919
and one project we just completed was

249
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,639
looking at

250
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,759
uh different fertilization

251
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,838
schedules

252
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,679
and their impact on

253
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,120
the subsequent

254
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,399
phytochemical content of flour

255
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,519
after harvest

256
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,120
and we found that um

257
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,600
and it may kind of seem like common

258
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,959
sense the healthier the plant the higher

259
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,560
content

260
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,919
of all phytochemicals you'll get in the

261
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,199
resulting flower

262
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,278
so

263
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,278
that kind of

264
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,120
is another aspect of that relationship

265
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,720
where you're

266
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,799
getting different ratios of cannabinoids

267
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,079
or terpenes but in general plant health

268
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:08,879
overall may drive an increase in both uh

269
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,319
phytochemical classes

270
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,320
yeah well that's really interesting i

271
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
didn't realize that cannabinoids and

272
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,720
terpenes may

273
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,120
share sort of a precursor molecule that

274
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
is that is used to synthesize both did i

275
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,399
understand that correct

276
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,600
you are correct

277
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,600
um

278
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,360
so it's a couple

279
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,519
um biosynthetic pathways

280
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,959
are required to make both cannabinoids

281
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,159
and terpenes and one of the earlier

282
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,359
um

283
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,759
reactions

284
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,879
the same precursor is required for both

285
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,439
uh

286
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,838
cannabinoids and terpenes

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,839
wow that's really that's really

288
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,480
interesting so before before we move on

289
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,640
to more of the the nitty gritty science

290
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,560
sciencey stuff in terms of terpenes and

291
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,639
kind of the organic chemistry and all

292
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,479
those things just before we leave behind

293
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,639
maybe some of the folks who aren't as

294
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,720
well-versed in terpenes i know that

295
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,319
sometimes my mom listens to this podcast

296
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,720
and we would totally leave her in the

297
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,000
dust are there is there sort of a high

298
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,320
level or kind of cliff notes

299
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,240
version of what people should understand

300
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,720
about terpenes so that they can get the

301
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,919
most out of their cannabis experience

302
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,680
sure

303
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:24,078
so terpenes are part of a class

304
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,559
called terpenoids more generally

305
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,199
that are one of the most prominent

306
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,278
class of plant secondary metabolites

307
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,399
found in nature so what is a plant

308
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:37,039
secondary metabolite so it's a molecule

309
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,958
that the plant synthesizes that is not

310
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,039
required for

311
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:44,159
its day-to-day function or its life

312
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,599
cycle it's used in uh

313
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,519
subsequent

314
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,920
interactions either

315
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,159
in ecology in nature maybe it's a

316
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,679
molecule that would attract

317
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,078
some kind of insect that could help

318
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,838
spread its pollen

319
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,239
or there may be other

320
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,000
evolutionary

321
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,919
basis for for wanting to produce this

322
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,600
molecule

323
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,039
so

324
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,959
terpenes or terpenoids

325
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,360
and that's an interesting thing that we

326
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,559
probably should define so generally

327
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,959
terpenoid

328
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:20,319
is a molecule

329
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,879
uh that contains an oxygen atom

330
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,959
and terpenes are um

331
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,958
within the same class but aren't oxygen

332
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,518
oxygenated so i'm going to use those

333
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,199
terms uh interchangeably or just

334
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,639
simplified for this podcast we can just

335
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,320
call them terpenes

336
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,079
um but that is one thing in the industry

337
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,639
where uh that's another kind of

338
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,120
definition that could confuse newer

339
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,120
patients

340
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,240
and is there

341
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,399
and

342
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,639
is there a difference in in effect if

343
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,240
you if you have one or the other or is

344
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,039
it just sort of

345
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,519
um different stages of

346
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,719
of that molecule within the life of the

347
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,200
plant

348
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,360
oh absolutely so

349
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,720
over 200 different terpenes have been

350
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
identified

351
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,000
in cannabis

352
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,440
so

353
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
when we're talking about the potential

354
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
pharmacology of these molecules

355
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,559
found in cannabis we actually have a

356
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,240
very broad scope of chemicals and that

357
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,000
results in a potentially broad

358
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,799
pharmacology

359
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,799
from each of these individual molecules

360
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,479
and you know some of the highlights

361
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,399
there's been numerous research articles

362
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,680
you can find online about pharmacology

363
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,759
of terpenes

364
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,759
but some of the highlights i like to

365
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,439
emphasize are you know they've been

366
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,639
shown to have anti-inflammatory

367
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,360
properties

368
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,799
antholytic which means anti-anxiety

369
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,480
analgesic

370
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,838
and antioxidant properties among others

371
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,759
and that last one i like to highlight

372
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,120
because

373
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,519
the fact that a terpene may have an

374
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,759
antioxidant property of course when a

375
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,959
patient consumes that terpene it may

376
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,039
protect

377
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,239
tissue in the body from free radical

378
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,519
damage

379
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,198
but it also

380
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,039
may protect

381
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,198
other phytochemicals

382
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:06,000
within the plant from oxidative

383
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,958
degradation so for example a really

384
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
interesting application would be what

385
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:15,278
do terpenes do to preserve cannabinoid

386
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,039
content in cannabis flower or

387
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,879
you know other uh cannabis based

388
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,879
formulations

389
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,278
that is interesting but just to go back

390
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,639
to the terpene versus terpenoids

391
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,879
distinction

392
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,959
um could you could you play that one

393
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,519
back and maybe we can explore that a bit

394
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,039
more sure

395
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,600
so terpenes are

396
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,319
part of a class a broader class called

397
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,320
terpenoids

398
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,439
and the

399
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,440
accepted definition in the industry

400
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,839
would be that a terpenoid

401
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,920
has an oxygen atom

402
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,920
as a part of the molecule and terpenes

403
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,958
are part of the same class

404
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,799
containing

405
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,799
a so-called isoprene unit

406
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,600
but without that oxygen atom so

407
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,879
if we may we take one step uh further up

408
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,240
the chain

409
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,000
so

410
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,000
terpenes are a part of a class call if

411
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,278
we really want to get into the yeah

412
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,120
let's do it or natural product chemistry

413
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,879
um

414
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
terpenes are part of a class called

415
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,480
isoprenoids so

416
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,799
an isopanoid contains a specific

417
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,079
chemical constituent called an isoprene

418
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,519
unit

419
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,278
and

420
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,679
the most prominent

421
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,559
terpenes found in cannabis are

422
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,359
monoterpenes which contain two isoprene

423
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,278
units and sesquiterpenes which contain

424
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,959
three isoprene units

425
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,000
and we can further

426
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,439
uh

427
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,240
differentiate these these classes

428
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,120
if we add an oxygen atom to them or

429
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,278
numerous oxygen atoms so oxygenated

430
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,879
terpenes are often referred to as

431
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,320
monoterpenoids

432
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,159
and oxygenated sesquiterpenes are also

433
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,000
often referred to as

434
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,278
sesqui terpenoids

435
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,120
but i think for simplicity um

436
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,679
you know you can refer to all terpenes

437
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,399
as just a terpene

438
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,599
got it so all the terpenes that we know

439
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,559
and love mercene limonene

440
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,839
beta-caryophyllene are they some kind of

441
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,599
combination of monoterpene

442
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,160
sesquiterpenes are they kind of all of a

443
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,240
similar class

444
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,559
yeah that's a great question so

445
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,600
each terpene is only going to belong to

446
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,518
one

447
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,320
terpene subclass

448
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,560
so for example mercying is a monoterpene

449
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,160
beta karyophylline is a sesquiterpene

450
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,439
and

451
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,439
those have slightly different

452
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,759
physical properties based upon their

453
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
differences in chemical structure and

454
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,039
that actually comes becomes important

455
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,720
when we talk about the stability of

456
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,278
these various terpenes

457
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,519
in uh formulations or flour and we get

458
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,240
into that i think a bit later

459
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,240
yeah

460
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,160
well let's do that now because

461
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,838
one of the things that's that's common

462
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,480
amongst all the terpenes is that they're

463
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,480
very volatile compounds correct and that

464
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,360
they're not

465
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,519
um

466
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,198
they're not staying around on the flower

467
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,480
for very very long that's one of the

468
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,199
reasons why we're smelling them right

469
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,160
they're com continually being

470
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,679
um emitted from the flower so i know

471
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,759
that a lot of your research has been

472
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,919
done on preserving the terpenes on the

473
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,000
flower so maybe we could talk a bit

474
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,600
about the strategies that you have come

475
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,759
up with

476
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,319
yeah ben you're exactly right so

477
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:39,038
like we mentioned before terpenes are

478
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,200
responsible for the characteristic aroma

479
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,079
and flavor of cannabis

480
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,440
and

481
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,678
um this is because they're inherently

482
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,919
volatile

483
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,480
are constantly evaporating from the

484
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,679
cannabis plant mixing with the air

485
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,798
and that uh provides us an opportunity

486
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,840
to spell them because uh we can access

487
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,119
um they can access our olfactory

488
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,599
receptors so it's kind of a double-edged

489
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,399
sword they smell amazing because they're

490
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,519
volatile but since they're volatile

491
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,038
they're

492
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,639
evaporating

493
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,679
from flower

494
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,160
and that causes a relative reduction in

495
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,759
concentration of terpenes and flour over

496
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,000
time

497
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,000
so

498
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,519
there are um

499
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,359
a couple parameters we should talk about

500
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,839
with the associated with the volatility

501
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,798
of terpenes first and foremost different

502
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,798
terpenes are going to have uh different

503
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,038
relative volatilities the smaller

504
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,960
terpenes or mono terpenes are more

505
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,359
susceptible to loss over time as

506
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,679
compared to the larger terpenes

507
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,839
sesquiterpenes

508
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,840
so

509
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,880
when a patient you know uses

510
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,240
flour on day one

511
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,360
they're going to have

512
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,519
one terpene profile on terpene content

513
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,839
and that may provide them

514
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,359
with a certain efficacy that they were

515
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,918
looking for

516
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,678
over time that not only is that profile

517
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,799
gonna change due to loss of terpene

518
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,640
content due to their inherent volatility

519
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,200
but the overall terpene content is also

520
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,679
going to be reduced so that's where the

521
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,519
loss and product quality is really

522
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,240
um

523
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,558
exaggerated over time due to the

524
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,000
volatility of terpenes and not only

525
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,558
product quality but potentially the

526
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,079
efficacy of the flower may change

527
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,678
towards treating different disease

528
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,159
states if we're changing the terpene

529
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,480
profile for example many monoterpenes

530
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,679
are associated with analgesic properties

531
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,839
so those are the terpenes that are

532
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,679
evaporating first you may not get that

533
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,240
same pain relief

534
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,960
from your cannabis flower on day i don't

535
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,720
know 30 as compared to day one

536
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,798
after purchase

537
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,240
so

538
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,279
um

539
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,038
you know what

540
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,599
it's important to try to understand this

541
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,599
from a scientific perspective about

542
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,879
what is the rate of loss of these

543
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,759
terpenes

544
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,400
and

545
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,720
um there's been some prior research

546
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,400
uh done on this so

547
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,720
dr asholi of course was ahead of the

548
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,600
game and published a paper in the 90s

549
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,960
um describing a 45 loss

550
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:17,279
of terpene content and cannabis flower

551
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,480
over a one month storage period

552
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,720
so

553
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,960
that that's a pretty quick loss almost

554
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,880
half of your terpenes are gone over one

555
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,480
month um

556
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,440
one month after purchase pretty much of

557
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,120
your of your package product

558
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,360
uh we also recently published a paper

559
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,119
that showed a similar result uh 50 of

560
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,519
the terpene content was lost after four

561
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,439
weeks of storage

562
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,960
and this does depend this rate of

563
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,360
degradation does kind of depend on a

564
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,720
couple factors environmental factors

565
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,719
including temperature

566
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,839
the terpene profile like i said if it's

567
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,679
if it's dominated by monoterpenes you're

568
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,798
more susceptible to a

569
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,880
faster

570
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:01,440
reduction in terpene content and kind of

571
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,760
the patient's

572
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,880
cadence of use of the product

573
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,359
so

574
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,960
the fundamental

575
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,279
reduction in terpene content from

576
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,679
cannabis flower comes from the fact that

577
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,200
terpenes are volatile and they evaporate

578
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,519
from the flower

579
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,480
and they'll fill the headspace

580
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,158
of the packaging that the flower is in

581
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,319
and when a patient goes to use that

582
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,360
flower they open up the container

583
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,918
and the terpenes that are in the

584
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,959
headspace are lost in the environment

585
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,120
so

586
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,640
um you know how often are the patient is

587
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,158
using flour

588
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,840
opening that opening and closing that

589
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,400
container will also affect the rate of

590
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,399
degradation

591
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,079
and i would i would imagine the method

592
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,720
of storage would would change that too

593
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:49,439
versus if you have it in a excuse me a

594
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,519
plastic bag versus a glass jar or

595
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,679
something like that

596
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,279
absolutely so

597
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,038
the

598
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,200
permeability of these terpenes through

599
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,679
different media may affect

600
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,120
the the rate of loss

601
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,200
something like glass you you wouldn't

602
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,639
expect terpenes to penetrate

603
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,319
that medium

604
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,600
whereas certain plastics they may be

605
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:13,038
able to

606
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,240
penetrate over time um

607
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:15,200
so yes i would agree with that

608
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,880
assessment

609
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,360
and you mentioned temperature as well

610
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,679
and i know that you know one of the

611
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,839
old-school ways of storing your cannabis

612
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,280
was to throw it in a freezer is that a

613
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,319
good strategy or no

614
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,079
yeah i mean it depends on the

615
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,798
application that you're

616
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,798
you're looking for

617
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,440
when we talk about

618
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,360
grower operators looking to obtain

619
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,000
a product such as live resin which would

620
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,558
mimic the phytochemical composition of

621
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,599
flour at the time of harvest they do

622
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,678
freeze that product immediately after

623
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,399
a harvest to preserve

624
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,200
that native terpene content at the time

625
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,840
of harvest um

626
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,159
so so that temperature is a

627
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,158
critical parameter in uh terpene

628
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,000
evaporation the hotter the temperature

629
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,799
the faster the terpenes will evaporate

630
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,798
and be lost from

631
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,759
all right so yeah let's let's talk a bit

632
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,440
about the research that you've done and

633
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,919
that you're going to be sharing at camed

634
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,919
2021 that's about

635
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,200
some novel technology that you have

636
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,520
developed to preserve and maybe even

637
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,440
reintroduce terpenes into flour do you

638
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,200
have that correct

639
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,720
yes we're very excited

640
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,960
at goodness growth

641
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:39,120
about our novel patent pending terp safe

642
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,880
technology so the origin of this product

643
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,599
was when we talked to

644
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,600
cultivators

645
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,919
they said that you know their biggest

646
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,919
fear is losing terpene content after

647
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,440
harvest they can cultivate the most

648
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,600
beautiful

649
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,080
cannabis flower with amazing

650
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,359
aromas and terpene profiles but after

651
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,359
harvest

652
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,839
they're susceptible to terpene loss and

653
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,158
of course there are things you can do

654
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,199
with drying and curing that kind of

655
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,480
reduce

656
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,360
um

657
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,519
terpene loss you know a slower lower dry

658
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,879
will preserve terpenes versus a hot

659
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,639
quick dry

660
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,480
but you know that that can only get you

661
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,000
so far once it's in the final package

662
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,839
product kind of like what we were

663
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,480
talking about before

664
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:26,158
terpenes will evaporate from the flower

665
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,360
and be lost the environment over time

666
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,440
so

667
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,719
uh with that in mind

668
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,558
we developed the

669
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,000
terp save technology

670
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:38,240
and the main principle behind it

671
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,240
is

672
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,840
if your patients are or excuse me if

673
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:49,120
your listeners are familiar with the

674
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,119
uh yeah maybe i'll take a step back

675
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,158
grab a drink

676
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,159
sure

677
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,839
so the main principle behind the terp

678
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:04,639
safe technology is the addition of

679
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,599
external or exogenous terpenes to the

680
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,120
packaging system and we feel that this

681
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,119
is a

682
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,119
meaningful

683
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,759
we feel that this is one of the first

684
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,080
meaningful improvements to cannabis

685
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,798
packaging in some time

686
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,079
so

687
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,038
the principle

688
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,960
is based on le chatelier's principle

689
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,079
if your listeners remember from general

690
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,278
chemistry

691
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:38,319
so terpenes are in an equilibrium

692
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,599
as far as the vapor stage

693
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,278
or

694
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,399
the solid stage

695
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,960
so the solid

696
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,519
solid stage terpenes are

697
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,679
a part of the cannabis flower and

698
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,759
they're in equilibrium evaporating and

699
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,840
condensing back on that cannabis flower

700
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,240
over time

701
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,439
with the turpsafe system we're adding

702
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,519
additional

703
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,798
vapor phase terpenes to the cannabis

704
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:05,519
packaging to drive terpenes back into

705
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,839
that solid phase of the cannabis flower

706
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,079
and in a peer-reviewed study we showed

707
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,319
that we can maintain the native terpene

708
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,199
content of cannabis flower for up to six

709
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,359
weeks

710
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,200
and we are continuing

711
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,199
to research this technology and we hope

712
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,558
to make additional claims in the future

713
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,240
about longer

714
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,480
storage durations

715
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,919
so not only does this maintain

716
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,120
the

717
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,759
product quality as far as the flavor and

718
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,959
aroma of cannabis flowers longer it

719
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,079
should also provide a more reliable

720
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,400
efficacy

721
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,599
from dose-to-dose or cannabis patients

722
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,240
as we are providing a more

723
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,079
reliable terpene profile

724
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,240
and content

725
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,399
independent upon many factors that can

726
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,400
cause variability in those two

727
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,400
parameters

728
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,880
so if i understand correctly then the

729
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:01,038
package itself is containing

730
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,840
terpenes that

731
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,000
that aid in sort of

732
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,000
keeping the the terpenes in the solid

733
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,079
stage so that they stay on the flower so

734
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,240
do you have to have the same terpene

735
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,079
profile in the package to match what the

736
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,519
flower has

737
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,960
yeah that's a great question so again it

738
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,000
depends on what application you're

739
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,440
looking at

740
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,640
so

741
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,759
one of the

742
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,399
basic applications for this technology

743
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,480
is to obtain a

744
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,599
terpene extract that mimics the profile

745
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,839
of your cannabis flower and that will

746
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,759
preserve that terpene profile longer as

747
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,798
compared to a

748
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,798
sample without terp save or control

749
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,398
another application that we're looking

750
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,359
at developing

751
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:47,599
is tuning the terpene profile

752
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,719
to achieve

753
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,798
specific

754
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,360
concentrations of various terpenes for

755
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,918
targeted disease states and this would

756
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,759
coincide with additional research

757
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,759
around terpene pharmacology but we're

758
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,359
really excited about that aspect from a

759
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,119
medicinal

760
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,119
or that application from a medicinal

761
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,678
aspect

762
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,918
yeah so in that case could you take

763
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,159
sort of a flower that's

764
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,278
where you know a lot of the the chirping

765
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,960
content has been evaporated off and then

766
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:20,720
sort of put it into this packaging and

767
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,720
reintroduce some terpenes into it

768
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,679
yeah that's a great question and that's

769
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,120
one of the experiments we report in the

770
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,880
peer-reviewed paper we rejuvenate

771
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,439
cannabis flower that was relatively

772
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,679
depleted of terpene content so i think

773
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,600
the flower had about point one percent

774
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,399
uh terpene so

775
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,678
almost

776
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,000
non-existent

777
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,798
um you know typically flour available

778
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,798
for

779
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,879
um

780
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,639
for consumption has about one to three

781
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,720
percent terpene content so you know

782
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,038
we're an order of magnitude below that

783
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,839
and using terp save we

784
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,440
uh

785
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,398
reinvigorated

786
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,798
or rejuvenated that terpene content uh

787
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,918
upwards of one percent so now we're

788
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,639
achieving

789
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,840
a terpene content suitable for

790
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,399
um pulmonary delivery

791
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,240
excellent and now is there sort of a a

792
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,558
limit to the amount of terpenes that you

793
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,359
can reintroduce into a flower like is

794
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,960
there just so much that it will

795
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,359
that it will

796
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,159
will take on

797
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,199
yes um and you can tune

798
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,640
uh

799
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,558
that value

800
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,399
by the amount of

801
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,918
uh external terpenes added to the

802
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,599
terpsafe system

803
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,520
so we found a linear relationship

804
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,599
between the amount of

805
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,960
external terpenes introduced and the

806
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,119
resulting

807
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,319
terpene content of the flower so this

808
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,719
would provide

809
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,000
grower processors with

810
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,960
a

811
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,960
application to

812
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:57,199
obtain cannabis flower with a specific

813
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,720
terpene content you know based upon uh

814
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,720
market and patient needs

815
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,639
excellent and so now what is the what is

816
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,200
the size of this packaging is this more

817
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,840
for you know wholesale large batches or

818
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,399
is this even down to like the individual

819
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,319
uh packaging that a consumer would would

820
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:17,038
take home

821
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,519
yeah that's a great question so

822
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,919
um we have launched terpsafe uh

823
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,000
nationally through licensing our

824
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,240
patentee bottles we can get that and we

825
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,319
can get into that in a little bit but

826
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,720
basically the

827
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,398
terp safe system

828
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,759
can be used at any

829
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,158
scale

830
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,960
packaging size

831
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,919
independent on on flower amount but for

832
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,798
our initial launch we have um

833
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,720
an all-in-one system where the turb safe

834
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:47,839
component is integrated directly into

835
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,120
the cap

836
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:53,439
of the cannabis packaging jar so

837
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,719
um i think the initial system is for 3.5

838
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,278
grams of canvas flour or eighth a pretty

839
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,720
common amount in the industry

840
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,720
but uh future iterations um

841
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,679
you know what it will be independent

842
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,798
upon

843
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,679
size

844
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,558
um

845
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,399
simply

846
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,480
for larger batches

847
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,639
uh you know for a grower processor who

848
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,919
wants to preserve uh terpene content

849
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,159
prior to packaging that material

850
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,559
you can just add a couple of these terp

851
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,240
safe components to larger amounts and

852
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,240
you get that same preservation that a

853
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,079
patient will experience in their

854
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,640
3.5 gram

855
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:33,278
container

856
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,519
excellent and now how many different

857
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:36,798
terpenes are you able to to use in this

858
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,720
system i know we mentioned that there

859
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,879
are there are over 200

860
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,399
um how many different ones are you able

861
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,200
to reintroduce or preserve

862
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,558
so we found in our initial study that

863
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,798
the system

864
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,319
was effective independent upon terpene

865
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,038
utilized

866
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,639
now the uh rate of

867
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,720
preservation

868
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,399
or infusion

869
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,399
may vary based upon

870
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,719
terpene utilized we found that the

871
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:07,439
monoterpenes are more volatile so they

872
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,679
offer a higher infusion rate

873
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,360
as compared to sesquiterpenes but in

874
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,880
principle

875
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,639
any terpene can be utilized in this

876
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,240
system that includes uh

877
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,960
terpenes derived from botanical

878
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,679
non-cannabis sources terpenes extracted

879
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,759
from cannabis plants can be reintroduced

880
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,798
to get that strain specific

881
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,079
terpene profile preservation and

882
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,599
even synthetic terpenes could be

883
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:35,439
utilized if the appropriate safety

884
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,519
considerations are

885
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,440
adhered to

886
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,359
wow well that's really that's really

887
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,399
fascinating

888
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,319
um

889
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,119
before i know we're kind of wrapping up

890
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,200
here but i i did want to touch on just

891
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:50,798
the difficulty of actually measuring

892
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,679
terpenes i know that something has come

893
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,119
up in

894
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,038
in conversations that i've had with

895
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,398
others who are kind of in the analytical

896
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,879
space or the the testing space

897
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,558
how difficult is it to test for for

898
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,480
terpenes specifically within the

899
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,798
cannabis matrix is that

900
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,200
um one of the reasons why maybe not a

901
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:11,440
lot of labs are testing for it and why

902
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,759
when we go to the dispensary we don't

903
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,480
always see terpene content

904
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,640
um on packaging

905
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,558
yeah as with any

906
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,640
botanically derived

907
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,079
samples there's going to be inherent

908
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,159
heterogeneity so there's going to be

909
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,759
variability across cannabis flower

910
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,200
you know even from the same location on

911
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,119
the cannabis plant

912
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,679
and like i mentioned

913
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,558
earlier in the talk

914
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,240
there are numerous sources that can

915
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,918
cause

916
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,640
variability in terpene profile and

917
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,320
terpene content and these

918
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,840
include cultivation and growth practices

919
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,558
how you're curing and drying your flower

920
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,199
genetic

921
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,000
and numerous other factors so because

922
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,240
this

923
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,159
there there is an inherent heterogeneity

924
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,159
of the sample that can definitely

925
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,719
cause

926
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:10,239
difficulties providing an accurate and

927
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,199
precise uh terpene content when tested

928
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,598
um

929
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,719
another thing is that

930
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,320
terpene analysis is expensive if you

931
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,759
know a girl processor wants to do it

932
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,119
in-house

933
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,839
the equipment is quite expensive the

934
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:28,480
headspace gc ms

935
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,480
is not cheap and you need someone with

936
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,358
some sort of experience or skill to

937
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,960
operate it

938
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,759
on the other hand

939
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,519
i found as we do

940
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,960
uh terpene analysis in-house that has

941
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:42,320
supported some of this research we

942
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,159
discussed today um

943
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,800
there's over 200 terpenes that have been

944
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,760
identified in cannabis flower

945
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,839
but when you're analyzing

946
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,879
uh for terpene content you're not gonna

947
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,719
quantitate all 200 of those

948
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,880
so there's going to be a lot of

949
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,279
potentially interfering compounds

950
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,200
they're quite similar as far as

951
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,359
many of them are isomers of one another

952
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,799
so my point is that terpene analysis

953
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,838
takes a lot of time

954
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,519
to get inaccurate and

955
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,358
to interpret the data to get an accurate

956
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,838
and precise result

957
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:20,239
so for a third party testing lab that

958
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,759
has to pay an analyst to do this that

959
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,078
there's definitely

960
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,079
um

961
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,719
you know a labor component that is

962
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,880
represented in what the charge for for

963
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,118
that analysis is going to be so a grower

964
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,000
processor really has to

965
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,838
weigh

966
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,519
if they want to spend that

967
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,639
amount of money to determine terpene

968
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,079
content

969
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,000
um

970
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,680
even though you know most

971
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,760
new patients are not familiar with what

972
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,039
a terpene even is so is there any added

973
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,440
value there

974
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,960
so i think the usp

975
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,200
cannabis expert panel recommends the

976
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,079
quantitation of five terpenes

977
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,879
for

978
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,760
all cannabis flower products

979
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,079
but um you know i don't think the

980
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,640
the industry has caught up to that yet

981
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,119
and frankly five is probably too

982
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,879
minimal you know 20 or more maybe a

983
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,480
little bit more appropriate

984
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,079
but um

985
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,639
you know with further uh patient

986
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,440
education and maturity of the industry

987
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:22,319
uh hopefully we we can improve this and

988
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,838
that may result in improved outcomes for

989
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,920
patients if they have more information

990
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:26,960
to make their decision decisions on what

991
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,880
cannabis

992
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,800
product to buy

993
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,960
absolutely and it is a great point you

994
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,200
make about sort of the

995
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,639
you know the heterogeneity of of the

996
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,199
plants themselves that you know if you

997
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,838
take one one bud from one section of the

998
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:43,519
plant and compare it to another uh they

999
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,599
could have different

1000
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,480
concentrations of these terpenes and

1001
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,519
then

1002
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,760
if you

1003
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,440
layer in the other variables

1004
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,839
of time how

1005
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,039
how long has it been since that sample

1006
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:58,078
was analyzed until it gets to you and

1007
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,800
could the

1008
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,640
the chemo type of change between

1009
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,079
then and now so

1010
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,000
it does

1011
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,039
it does make sense that your solution

1012
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,679
here is is going to create a much more

1013
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,838
consistent product uh so that people can

1014
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,519
get some more reliable results

1015
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:18,880
yeah ben you describe one of our main

1016
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:21,440
applications for terp save which is a

1017
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,720
more reliable terpene profile terpene

1018
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,159
crop content across the entire batch of

1019
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,679
cannabis flour

1020
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,559
and

1021
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,679
we envision batch to batch

1022
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:34,000
reproducibility as you know different

1023
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,358
harvests if plants are grown in the

1024
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,960
winter versus the summer may have

1025
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,799
different terpene profiles if they're

1026
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,559
exposed a different amount of light

1027
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,480
they'll have different terpene profiles

1028
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:47,119
so all these are factors that we can

1029
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,880
reduce their impact on the variability

1030
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,280
