this episode's guest is dr david jolie

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,120
he is the associate professor at the

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,920
university of moncton where his team

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,480
investigates cannabis and cannabinoids

75
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,318
dr jolie has a unique expertise in the

76
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,639
field of plant genomics and their

77
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,439
associated microbes and his work has

78
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,839
been cited more than one thousand times

79
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,959
earlier this year dr jolie published a

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,200
paper titled genome-wide

81
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,319
characterization of the mlo gene family

82
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,839
in cannabis sativa reveals two genes as

83
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,359
strong candidates for powdery mildew

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,598
susceptibility it's an important paper

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,000
when it comes to breeding powdery mildew

86
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:41,518
resistant cannabis plants

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,560
as we discuss pm is as common as it is

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,879
destructive and it torments all types of

89
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,878
cannabis growers from the hobbyist home

90
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,959
grower to large-scale commercial

91
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,919
operators

92
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,920
in our conversation we discuss how pm

93
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,559
infects cannabis plants and how

94
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,878
environmental conditions play a role

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,280
the prevention and remediation options

96
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,679
cannabis cultivators currently have

97
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,239
the difference between pm resistance and

98
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,640
pm susceptibility and how both

99
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
variations can affect the severity of

100
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,798
infection

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,040
how breeding out pm susceptibility genes

102
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,879
provides more robust protection than

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,360
breeding in pm resistance genes

104
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,839
what are mlo genes and how do they

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,879
affect pm susceptibility

106
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,439
how mlo genes were used to breed out pm

107
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,120
susceptibility in other crops

108
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,279
the importance of having a quality

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,600
reference genome to investigate genes of

110
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,758
interest and much more

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,800
before we get to my conversation with dr

112
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,280

[Music]

145
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,799
good afternoon david thanks for joining

146
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,959
us

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,360
thank you

148
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,918
all right so you and your team recently

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,600
published a pretty important paper on

150
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,318
powdery mildew

151
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,879
susceptibility which we are going to get

152
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
into but first i wanted to lay some

153
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,000
groundwork

154
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,079
our audience here on the podcast

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,720
includes people from all facets of the

156
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,599
cannabis industry and not everyone's

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,080
going to be intimately familiar with pm

158
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,639
so let's start by outlining the powdery

159
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,000
mildew problem so i was wondering if you

160
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,160
could explain

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,240
why is powdery mildew a threat to

162
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
cannabis cultivation and really you know

163
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,280
what is at stake here

164
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,439
yeah well uh first of all i would say

165
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,439
that powder mildew is a threat because

166
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,240
it's very common first of all so it's

167
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,399
not something rare that you know people

168
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
are likely not to expect so it's it

169
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,519
certainly will happen at some point so

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,160
it's very common and

171
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,079
it can spread very quickly so when once

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
a crop is infected so usually the

173
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,639
recovery options are

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,199
often limited so we don't want growers

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,400
of course to use those nasty fungicides

176
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,000
that we we see sometime on other crops

177
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,000
so we still have access to a few uh

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,519
environmentally friendly

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,038
options but those are not always

180
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:34,719
very efficient or they are not easy to

181
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,598
apply on larger scale

182
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
so

183
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,918
now about its impact on the plant itself

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,079
of course it will really kill it because

185
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,478
it's what we call an obligate biotroph

186
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,199
so it needs living tissues

187
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,800
to

188
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,720
propagate but it can severally reduce

189
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,038
photosynthesis when it gets out of

190
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,919
control especially and thus it will in

191
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,000
the end affect yield so something that

192
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,639
no grower wants won't

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,399
another impact i can think of is of

194
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
course it will affect the smell of the

195
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,519
plant so when you have a plant infected

196
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,599
by padre mildew people will notice it as

197
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,758
a different smell and so we know that

198
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,399
consumers are more and more interested

199
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,479
in you know the flavors and the scent

200
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,000
uh the aromas of their

201
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,159
of their cannabis

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,560
so certainly it's a problem that people

203
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,879
will want to avoid

204
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,959
sure and now

205
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,000
it's called powdery mildew because it

206
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,958
has sort of a powdery white look on the

207
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,879
leaves when a plant is infected and i'm

208
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,038
familiar with the fact that it will show

209
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:41,278
up on the leaves does it also infect the

210
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:43,038
flower itself will it sort of affect

211
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,559
the bud that eventually would get to the

212
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,120
consumer

213
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,359
yeah well we we often say that uh that

214
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,399
powder mildew can affect

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,560
uh all aerial parts of the plant so it

216
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,799
will include stems

217
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,559
as long as they're non-woody

218
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,559
it can infect the leaves and it can

219
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,359
infect some part of the

220
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,319
of the flowers not all but like when we

221
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,320
refer

222
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,040
uh to cannabis flowers so of course we

223
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,000
have the like the bracts and those can

224
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,919
be uh can be infected by powdery mildew

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,159
but but we need to understand that

226
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,679
powdery mildew so you know

227
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,759
you will hear a lot of things about

228
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,399
polymer people will will say it's

229
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,360
systemic and stuff like that

230
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,919
so

231
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,800
if i can describe rapidly how powdery

232
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,319
will do work so usually like uh pardon

233
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,479
me will do first it's it's a fungus

234
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,839
right so it will propagate mainly

235
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,720
through its

236
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,240
asexual spores that we call canadia

237
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,120
so those pores will land on a leaf

238
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,080
and then they will germinate and produce

239
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,360
those

240
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,839
kind of tiny projections into

241
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,159
the cells from the epidermis and only

242
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,399
the epidermis so powder mildew will only

243
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,559
affect one layer of cells which is the

244
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,399
first layer of cells it won't get

245
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,599
further down than that compared with

246
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,839
other

247
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,560
fungi so it is certainly not systemic it

248
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,560
is very restricted to the epidermis now

249
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,199
we have epidermis on

250
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,599
leaves but we also have epidermis on the

251
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,600
stem so that's why you can see

252
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,759
uh powdery mildew

253
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,639
elsewhere so those tiny projections i

254
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:21,039
was i was talking about so that gets

255
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,319
into the plant cells so

256
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,278
they are

257
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,000
needed by the fungus to absorb its

258
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,240
nutrients from the plant uh but it will

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
also be a way for a fungus to suppress

260
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,360
the defense response from the plant

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,958
but then

262
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,200
why do people think it's systemic

263
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,278
well there's many reasons for that so in

264
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
in other plants that

265
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,360
survive

266
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,759
winter for example so people tuck it

267
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,000
with systemic because very rapidly in

268
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,958
the spring you could see powdery mildew

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,200
appear

270
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,919
and so the reason for that is that it

271
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
can stay dormant within

272
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,639
buds and i'm not talking about cannabis

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,679
buds here but like any axillary buds

274
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,600
that you can

275
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,319
find on a plant and it can also stay

276
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,519
dormant on plant debris

277
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
and

278
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,039
mostly i think the big reason is that

279
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,199
it can be present but at a very low

280
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,519
level so people will think that the

281
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,519
plant is healthy they will then

282
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,000
propagate it or share it with friends

283
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,759
and then suddenly the conditions become

284
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,600
favorable and it will

285
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,319
be a big boom

286
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,000
for the fungus but it was there it can

287
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,120
stay you know dormant at very low levels

288
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,839
yeah so

289
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,480
important thing you mentioned there so

290
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,279
environmental conditions can sort of

291
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,159
bring on an infection

292
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,799
yeah for sure and i mean so that's why

293
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,719
usually so you know people will have uh

294
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,240
their mother plants

295
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,720
um and so your mother plants are in

296
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,759
a sitting where usually the humidity is

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,440
not as high as the cuttings will be

298
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,679
once the you know once they start

299
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,399
propagating that plant

300
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,719
so you have a plan that was maybe not in

301
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,559
the ideal conditions for the fungus so

302
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,399
you don't see it but it's still there

303
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,159
it's still somewhere and then when you

304
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,159
do the cuttings you put them you know

305
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,399
into higher humidity level and then the

306
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:21,600
fungus likes it it will start to

307
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,799
propagate and then when you

308
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
when you get your

309
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,559
your plants outside

310
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,000
outside of the

311
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,278
of the

312
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,240
uh well outside of the rooting period

313
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,320
uh

314
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,399
it will add time to

315
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,720
get established and then

316
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,519
people will often also see it getting

317
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,560
more important during flowering so is it

318
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,639
because it had time to mature or because

319
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,919
the canopy is maybe

320
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,839
more dense

321
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,599
or also because i don't know if the

322
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,440
light can affect i'm not sure it has

323
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,320
been studied but maybe like because we

324
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,720
changed the uh the light regime during

325
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,278
flowering maybe it also helps the the

326
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,839
apology mildew to propagate

327
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,879
more easily

328
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,760
okay

329
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,720
so

330
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,200
i know you briefly touched on it but

331
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
i mean a lot of your paper is is about

332
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
trying to identify these genes that may

333
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,838
be responsible for susceptibility to

334
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,079
powdery mildew and then there's also um

335
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
the opportunity of finding powdery

336
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,919
mildew resistant genes which i'm sure

337
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,839
we'll get into but in the absence of

338
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,679
sort of breeding for

339
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,760
la uh resistance

340
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,399
what

341
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:36,319
steps do cultivators currently have

342
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,440
to either prevent pm infection or once

343
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,079
it's happened sort of remediate it

344
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,480
uh yeah so i mean

345
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,239
right now as i said at the

346
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,920
very beginning so there are a few

347
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,278
options that exist to kind of reduce

348
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,198
uh the the incidence of the incidence of

349
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,439
the disease um

350
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,120
so and and about those products so i

351
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,519
know there was uh there was a study

352
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,480
conducted by the group of uh the group

353
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,720
of zamir punja at simon fraser

354
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,720
university who you also had on your

355
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,000
podcast a year ago

356
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,320
uh so they

357
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,399
they tested a bunch of uh of different

358
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,040
products so some are based on the use of

359
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,198
bacteria that will attack the fungus

360
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,799
so we can talk about the

361
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:26,639
products like actinovate or rhapsody

362
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:30,399
but they also look at products that are

363
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,159
based on plant extracts such as neem oil

364
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,679
and also some other products that are

365
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:39,600
well known in the in the organic farming

366
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:42,719
uh such as uh potassium bicarbonate

367
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,480
or that we know uh as milstop is the

368
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,320
name of the product that we often see

369
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,278
for cannabis use

370
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,920
or

371
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,679
hydrogen peroxide also which is another

372
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,159
product so there are different products

373
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,799
some people will talk also about

374
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,759
silicon because in in other crops it has

375
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,359
been shown to be very useful to reduce

376
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,078
powdery mildew

377
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,839
uvc lights that are getting also

378
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,599
popularity so those are

379
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,880
different methods that can be used to

380
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,920
reduce

381
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,039
the incidence but i guess before we have

382
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,519
to use

383
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,958
those those products i think the key is

384
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,198
to try to keep your plants as clean

385
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,799
as possible so as soon as you detect

386
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,000
infection remove

387
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:29,838
uh the infected plant parts try to not

388
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,320
have dense canopies as i said earlier

389
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,759
try to keep the humidity maybe a little

390
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,560
lower

391
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,519
of course it is a fungus that is

392
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,919
airborne so those pores are very

393
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,600
easily transported by by any air

394
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,439
movement so you know

395
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,278
outside it's easy to understand that i'm

396
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,079
talking about wind but in inside you

397
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,919
know just people moving around or

398
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,399
so you can get spores on your on your

399
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,879
clothes and then you get into another

400
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
another room and then those spores can

401
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,919
infect

402
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,360
uh the plants

403
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,599
and uh

404
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,600
so yeah so trying to reduce so if you

405
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,440
have a room that is completely infected

406
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
of course don't go in that room before

407
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,320
going into your cleaner room so you know

408
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:16,160
just simple steps like that trying to

409
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,879
reduce the inoculum levels

410
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,480
excellent excellent and so that breeds

411
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,039
it brings us to

412
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,440
the prospect of actually breeding for

413
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,599
resistance to pottery mildew which is

414
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,360
what your paper is about so

415
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,199
first of all

416
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,600
powdery mildew doesn't just infect

417
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,278
cannabis and infects a whole range of

418
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,680
other crops so i was wondering if you

419
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:40,399
could maybe explain how

420
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,879
breeders have successfully bred for

421
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,879
resistance in other crops and how we

422
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,720
might use that information to uh to

423
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,439
achieve it in cannabis

424
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,480
yeah yeah so as you said exactly so

425
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,519
powder mildew is a big family

426
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,680
of

427
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,679
fungal pathogens so we have different

428
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:03,198
species some will be very host specific

429
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,279
and others have a broader host range and

430
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,359
it is the case for the one we have and

431
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,000
and before we talk about resistance this

432
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,318
is

433
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,959
something we can just talk for a few

434
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,558
secs so it's it's a problem in itself so

435
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,400
when you have something that's very host

436
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,199
specific as long as you don't have any

437
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,759
of those plants nearby so

438
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,360
you know you you're less likely to get

439
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,599
that disease so let's say you have a

440
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,240
cannabis feel but you know there is no

441
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,079
cannabis field around if if the fungus

442
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,079
was specific to cannabis then it's less

443
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,279
likely it will get into your field but

444
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,439
the problem is that the species we have

445
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,480
is not specific to

446
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,798
uh only to cannabis so it can also

447
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,679
infect a lot of different plants from

448
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:45,599
the

449
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,320
the aster family so we have a lot of

450
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,159
flowers like when we think about

451
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,240
dahlias and

452
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,120
sunflowers so they can get infected by

453
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,759
that same species and also some

454
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,599
weeds like ragweed can also be infected

455
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,000
so that's something also to consider

456
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,319
when we're growing outside

457
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,480
but let's get into the

458
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,599
the resistance at least

459
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,279
what we learned from other crops so

460
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,480
um

461
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:17,678
i think some of the the first things

462
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,798
that were discovered so it was on barley

463
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,320
uh more than 50 years ago so they they

464
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,798
they discovered

465
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,839
some uh accessions

466
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,200
from africa that were completely

467
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,439
resistant to uh

468
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,000
to padre mildew and then

469
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,840
that was the the first point

470
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,679
and so they started to investigate

471
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:41,199
trying to understand what was going on

472
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,440
and and they realized at some point that

473
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,000
it is a form of resistance but we prefer

474
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,759
to call it like a loss of susceptibility

475
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,599
so

476
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,599
resistance and susceptibility you know

477
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,079
we we kind of try

478
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,359
we often think that it is the same thing

479
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,678
so one is uh you know the plant is

480
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,479
either resistant or susceptible but in

481
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,960
terms of breeding so when you breed a

482
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,798
resistant plant we can see it as we're

483
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,558
bringing something new to the plant we

484
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,759
bring a new genes that will confer

485
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:14,720
resistance but there's another way to

486
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,200
to achieve resistance is to

487
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,880
reduce susceptibility so you know you

488
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,880
have maybe something in the plans that

489
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,720
confer susceptibility

490
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,480
and you want to remove that from the

491
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,319
plan so of course people will think well

492
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,440
susceptibility if there was something in

493
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,038
the plant that would cause

494
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,279
susceptibility

495
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,759
it would have been you know eliminated

496
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,359
by years of

497
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,279
natural selection

498
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,519
but the problem is that maybe those

499
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,839
genes are very useful for the plants so

500
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,079
the plant cannot get rid of them but

501
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,918
there's a caveat of having those genes

502
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,918
is that they you know they cause

503
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,759
susceptibility to some

504
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,280
to some fungal pathogens and this is

505
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,279
exactly what

506
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,000
some genes are and people are getting

507
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,519
interest into those genes but mlo is one

508
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,079
of those examples so it's not a

509
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,158
resistant gene it's a susceptibility

510
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,359
gene so we need to

511
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,120
find

512
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,319
cannabis strains that have either an

513
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,158
inactive

514
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,319
version of that gene or a mutated

515
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,120
version of that gene that will

516
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,798
make it more difficult to the pathogen

517
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,199
to infect

518
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,879
and so one interesting thing also when

519
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,159
we're talking about

520
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,480
resistance so

521
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,280
as as you said so i published a paper

522
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,798
recently about the mlo family but almost

523
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,200
at the same time so there's another

524
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,079
group that published a paper about pm1

525
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,240
which is a resistant gene so we can talk

526
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,000
a little bit more about those two

527
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,120
side of the coin

528
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,038
so resistant gene the way that

529
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,199
i can describe it from a genetic point

530
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,519
of view is what we call

531
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,319
a gene for gene interaction so you have

532
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,440
one resistant gene in the plant

533
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,519
that is able to recognize one gene from

534
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,679
the pathogen so it's a little bit like a

535
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,558
you know like our own

536
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,480
immune system so it's not it's not

537
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,000
working the same way but it's easier to

538
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,919
understand if we compare it to that so

539
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,919
we have something that is more of a

540
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,840
recognition system so that gene can

541
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,000
recognize the pathogen and triggers

542
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,439
defense responses that will kill the

543
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,558
pathogen

544
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,000
um

545
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,279
the problem with that types of

546
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,159
resistance

547
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,440
is that

548
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,000
it's usually isolate specific so it will

549
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,200
recognize only a few isolate or you know

550
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,038
one population of the pathogen or it can

551
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
for a while looks like if it's

552
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,879
recognized the whole

553
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,559
the whole species but after a while the

554
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,400
pathogen will rapidly evolve to overcome

555
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,399
that resistance so

556
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,880
uh leading us to what we call a

557
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
co-evolutionary arms race

558
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,400
um

559
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,200
and so we constantly need to find

560
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,120
new genes of that kind so new resistant

561
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
genes and we can try to

562
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,918
breed

563
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,558
a lot of them together so that would

564
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,640
mean maybe it will be more durable but

565
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:02,158
usually if you have only one

566
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,200
it will likely not be durable

567
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
and now when we talk about

568
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,798
susceptibility then it's different so

569
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:11,038
susceptibility is usually more durable

570
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,038
and the reason for that is that

571
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,079
you're removing something that the

572
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,240
fungus needs to enter or to infect the

573
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,158
plant so it's very

574
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,400
difficult for the pathogen to adapt to

575
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,240
that kind of situation something is

576
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,159
missing so it cannot you know just

577
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,919
create it so that kind of resistant

578
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,559
resistance it's

579
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,320
loss of system of susceptibility less of

580
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,519
susceptibility will become a form of

581
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,279
resistance

582
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:42,240
so it is in that case way more durable

583
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,480
but the problem is it's also more

584
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,240
difficult to breathe because it's a form

585
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,919
of resistive resistance a little bit

586
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,640
like if you have two people with brown

587
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,600
eyes you know it's easy it's easy to get

588
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,000
a child

589
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,558
with brown eyes but to get a child with

590
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,558
blue eyes then it it depends of if there

591
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,480
are some blue jeans hidden

592
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,399
somewhere so it's the same thing here

593
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,960
you need to

594
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,720
find uh to bring that

595
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,200
level of um

596
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,000
having the two mutated copies or or the

597
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
two

598
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,839
different genes

599
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,079
must be inactivated at the same time so

600
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,639
it's it's a little bit harder uh to

601
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:23,199
breed but if i come back to that uh to

602
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,400
that example of barley i was talking

603
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
about so

604
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,038
15 year

605
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,360
50 years later so it's still

606
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,798
working so we can see that still very

607
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,959
durable

608
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,480
so yeah and that was

609
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,759
something that i needed to kind of wrap

610
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,599
my head around when i was reading the

611
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,240
paper was that

612
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,719
um you actually want less

613
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,278
mlo for to really kind of simplify

614
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,120
things you want less mlo to have more

615
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,640
resistance and one of the quotes that i

616
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,558
pulled out from the paper that really

617
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,840
hammers this home is that you said

618
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,720
expression of mlo is necessary for the

619
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,759
successful invasion of pm

620
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,200
so

621
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,278
really what you're trying to do is

622
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,360
eliminate that mlo so it can't

623
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,000
successfully invade correct

624
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,038
exactly exactly but then as i said it's

625
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,440
it's not

626
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:13,278
that easy because

627
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,440
if that gene is still there it's because

628
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,119
it plays another role and that's usually

629
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,360
what people are

630
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,678
seeing is that if you inactivate a

631
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:25,839
susceptibility gene you can have some

632
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:29,919
pleiotropic effect so in the case of mlo

633
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:33,599
so it's very variable so in some crops

634
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:36,960
where they did that so you have some um

635
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:39,599
they will see that they have either

636
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,840
an increased susceptibility toward other

637
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,759
diseases so it's more resistant to palgy

638
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,558
mildew but it becomes more susceptible

639
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:49,359
to other diseases or you will have

640
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:51,599
early leaves in essence and stuff like

641
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,759
that but in in other crops

642
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,798
there doesn't seem to be any effects so

643
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,359
maybe under some conditions it will

644
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,839
it would cause something bad but under

645
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,000
the conditions that we keep our plants

646
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,359
into you know we take care of our plants

647
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,079
we fertilize them and so on so maybe

648
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,558
it will never show any bad effects so we

649
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,319
don't know for cannabis it will if it

650
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,119
will show some of those pliotropic

651
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:20,158
effects but if not then it would become

652
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:23,839
something very interesting to breed

653
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,720
sure and now do we understand what mlo

654
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,720
does to sort of help pm invade the plant

655
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,960
like what the mechanism is there

656
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,519
no even though people have been studying

657
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,400
it for a while so they they consider mlo

658
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,200
as a negative regulator of plant immune

659
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,440
plant immunity uh but apart from that we

660
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,240
have no clear idea of what it does there

661
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,880
are other mlos uh that are not involved

662
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,558
in powdery mildew susceptibility so we

663
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,960
know a little bit

664
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,278
of the functions that those genes are

665
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,200
are doing but clearly it

666
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,359
it is not an indication that the the one

667
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,278
we're talking about here that dictates

668
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,119
patreon do susceptibility would have a

669
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,519
similar function

670
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,798
sure yeah and that's a good point so

671
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:09,599
there are more than one mlo genes in the

672
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,519
plant and not all of them are sort of

673
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,639
implicated in this pm

674
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,879
infection correct yeah exactly so in in

675
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,038
some plants you can have i don't know

676
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,840
five maybe six ah

677
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:24,558
okay no let's start wider in that so

678
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,519
most plants will have you know around 15

679
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:30,240
or more

680
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:32,400
mlos but within those mlos

681
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,759
you know you have different subfamilies

682
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,360
if i if i can say and there's only one

683
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,440
that is

684
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,119
involved in uh powdery mildew

685
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,960
susceptibility

686
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,000
so the other one they play other roles

687
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,400
as i was explaining earlier on but so

688
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,880
and even within that subfamily so then

689
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,759
it depends between crops so for some

690
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,840
plants

691
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,480
if you have for example three

692
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,558
three genes uh in that subfamily maybe

693
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,679
you will need to inactivate all those

694
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,839
three to get resistance but in other

695
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,038
crops there seems to be maybe one that

696
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,599
is uh

697
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,278
the leader or more important and then if

698
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:13,038
you inactivate that one it should be

699
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:15,440
enough so in cannabis we found two genes

700
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,839
in that in that subfamily but we don't

701
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,278
know yet if both are

702
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,759
required

703
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:24,720
for for susceptibility or if maybe it's

704
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,919
only one of them

705
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,919
okay

706
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,240
and now to your knowledge

707
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,880
are there pm resistant strains of

708
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,798
cannabis out there currently do they

709
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,080
exist

710
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:37,918
um

711
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,558
resistant

712
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,200
strains i would say yes

713
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:46,960
resistant strains that are resistant

714
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,038
because of mlo inactivation

715
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,919
i'm not sure maybe

716
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,398
um

717
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,038
so because as i said so we have those

718
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,599
other examples like like the the the

719
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,519
strains that have the pm1 gene

720
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,558
and i'm aware of other people that have

721
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,720
those plans that will stay completely

722
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,398
you know clean of powdery mildew and

723
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,399
even though they are surrounded by you

724
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,000
know plants that are covered with it

725
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,079
so clearly there there are probably a

726
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,398
lot of those genes that are similar to

727
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:19,199
pm1 uh so it's just a matter now of of

728
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,959
uh i did identifying a lot of those

729
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,880
genes and trying to bring them all

730
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,880
together to have a very

731
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,760
resistant plan that will

732
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,559
resist to you know a lot of different uh

733
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:33,599
poger mildew populations mlo i'm not

734
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,759
sure the problem right now is that if we

735
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,798
look at what was done for

736
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:42,158
uh for barley and it was the same for

737
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:43,119
peas and for tomatoes so

738
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,520
the

739
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,278
the plans the accessions they found that

740
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,319
add that mlo

741
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,960
resistance it was always you know in in

742
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,879
ancient land races and stuff like that

743
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,079
something that you know

744
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,919
we haven't explored that much uh for

745
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,000
cannabis yet so and even

746
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,080
if we consider going back to wild

747
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,919
populations then it will be a matter of

748
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,759
trying to find those wild populations

749
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,278
because it's not clear if they still

750
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,759
exist

751
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,159
right and yeah so going back to sort of

752
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,960
that that pm1

753
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,039
side of the coin as you said so and if

754
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,519
i'm correct that group that that

755
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:24,158
published on the pm1 gene they were

756
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,240
looking at one snip

757
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,720
to sort of indicate whether or not a

758
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,798
cultivar was resistant is that enough

759
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,240
information to to really make that call

760
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,278
it seems

761
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:39,599
um well i mean it it would not be a

762
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:41,200
first for sure so if we look into uh

763
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,278
uh where

764
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,679
a lot of different genes

765
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,960
like that have been identified and

766
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,440
studied so we can think about wheat

767
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,600
with regards to rust which is a big

768
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,000
problem affecting wheat or even

769
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,879
potato in its relation with late blight

770
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,679
which is also another big uh big problem

771
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,520
so

772
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,038
uh in those two systems there is a lot

773
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,119
of genes like that that have been

774
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,359
identified and sometimes that's that's

775
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,199
the only thing that will be different

776
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,798
between a susceptible and a resistant

777
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,080
plant you have one snip in that

778
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:17,759
resistant gene that will cause an amino

779
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:20,079
acid change and that's enough to gain

780
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,319
resistance or lose it depending on how

781
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,119
you want to see it but but then the same

782
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,918
is true on the pathogen side so that

783
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,398
gene that is recognized only one snip

784
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,200
can make it not being recognized anymore

785
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,519
so that's that arms race i was

786
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,840
i was referring to so

787
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,359
it's always difficult to predict how

788
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,519
long it will be useful

789
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,759
sure and then i guess another point that

790
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,839
you had made is that there can be a lot

791
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,879
of different ways to to skin the cat

792
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:53,678
here it could be a combination of

793
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,480
different proteins that are inferring

794
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,840
the

795
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,720
resistance or the lack of susceptibility

796
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,678
so

797
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,600
um

798
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,880
it could be that uh you know a snip

799
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,678
that's identified in a certain

800
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,200
population might not necessarily apply

801
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,278
to a wider

802
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,278
a wider population correct

803
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,720
yeah maybe yeah we don't know enough

804
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,558
about about those genes as of now and

805
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,480
then there's also

806
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,879
that idea so for now i talked about

807
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,038
susceptibility and resistance but within

808
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,799
resistance so what i was talking about

809
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,440
mostly is what we call

810
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:29,918
uh qualitative resistance so it's either

811
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,600
your resistance or you're not but then

812
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,679
there's also what we call

813
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,558
quantitative resistance which is a lot

814
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,679
different

815
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,319
uh

816
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,720
harder to breed as well because it's

817
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,158
we don't know exactly how it works uh

818
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,240
there is a lot of genes that are

819
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,799
involved each one you know playing a

820
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,038
minor role and it's together that they

821
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,839
bring resistant

822
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,440
resistance to a strain and

823
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,678
so

824
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,080
trying to find an example for cannabis

825
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,278
would be maybe the the genes that have

826
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,798
been identified by the medicinal

827
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,519
genomics group

828
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:08,960
so they identified

829
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,359
chitinases and automatons

830
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,679
that seem to correlate with the levels

831
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,759
of padry mildew resistance so in that

832
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,240
case i would tend to believe that maybe

833
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,558
they are involved in something more

834
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,919
quantitative and so those are very

835
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:23,839
interesting because quantitative

836
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,159
resistance as i said is harder to breed

837
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,798
but as anything that is harder to breed

838
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,840
it's also it also means that it's harder

839
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,000
for the pathogen to defeat

840
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,079
interesting and another thing that that

841
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
i picked up in the paper that sort of

842
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,119
maybe talks to

843
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,398
maybe more of a quantitative type of

844
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,839
lack of susceptibility

845
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,918
was that

846
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:49,678
if i understood correctly hemp actually

847
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:52,159
has fewer mlo genes in which case it

848
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,960
might be less susceptible to pm did i

849
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,960
get that right yeah well i mean it's

850
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,120
it's uh it's uh

851
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,480
i would say it's a hypothesis that we

852
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,319
that we put forward uh of course in our

853
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,120
paper so we looked at five different

854
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,599
genomes uh those genomes are certainly

855
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:13,599
not all perfect and there was only one

856
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:17,359
that was really from hemp uh so finola

857
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:21,199
genome cbd rx is is uh considered as you

858
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:24,000
know having some hemp ancestry uh so

859
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,600
those two were the one that only had one

860
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,558
uh well for one of the copies the the

861
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,398
then

862
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,398
for one of the two genes they only had

863
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,879
one copy so

864
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,278
is is is this an indication that hemp

865
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,559
would be more resistant and and it's

866
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,119
also

867
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,359
uh it's also hard to talk about hem

868
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,278
because what we call hemp in canada is

869
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,119
sometimes different than hemp in the u.s

870
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:48,960
so hemp in canada it's often what we

871
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,439
call industrial hemp

872
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,440
uh while the us hemp is more like cbd

873
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,159
producing plants but they often have the

874
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,399
same ancestry as you know

875
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,278
thc producing plants

876
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,759
sure

877
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,200
yeah and so you touched on the fact that

878
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,599
sort of the process that you went

879
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,840
through to investigate these genes is

880
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,719
you used a variety of different

881
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,078
reference genomes um

882
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,838
sort of

883
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,159
how important is it to have a really

884
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,239
strong reference to do this type of work

885
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,039
and sort of what was the variation in

886
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,158
quality that you encountered

887
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,039
yeah so i think i mean any people

888
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,159
doing

889
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:30,559
research is is always looking for one

890
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,838
reference genome so you usually that's

891
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:35,440
what they have in other crops so when we

892
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:36,398
started uh working

893
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,079
um

894
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,480
we were looking for

895
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,240
which one we could we should use as the

896
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,240
reference because it was not clear like

897
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,319
you know a lot of people

898
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,479
were considering purple kush as the

899
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,559
reference just because you know there

900
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,760
was a first draft of it in 2011

901
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,599
but

902
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,440
we were aware that purple kush was not

903
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,480
the best one so some people were

904
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,280
considering cbd rx as as the new

905
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,320
reference genome because you know it has

906
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,119
a very high quality so we decided to

907
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,200
uh

908
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,440
first decide on which one we would call

909
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:14,319
our reference genome so we had a look at

910
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,358
first jamaican lion cbd rx and purple

911
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,960
kush

912
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,279
and then only looking at those tree it

913
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,480
was not easy to decide which one was the

914
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:26,720
best so you know each one has its

915
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,039
as it benefits i would say so cbd rx was

916
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,719
you know a very clean i would say so

917
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,838
maybe two clean we'll talk about that

918
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,439
maybe

919
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:38,400
maybe later so you know uh very less

920
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,079
repetitive compared to the other genomes

921
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,800
uh and it add the um

922
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,920
it had a chromosome level assembly which

923
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,880
was uh very interesting so we kind of

924
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,400
uh

925
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,320
you know we were considering maybe that

926
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,639
one is the best one jamaican lion was

927
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,760
also very good but it was

928
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:00,400
maybe a little bit more repetitive

929
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,400
and also

930
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,119
there was no chromosome level assembly

931
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,119
at least available to the public uh

932
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,920
purple kush well it was the worst of the

933
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,240
three so we can skip this one for now

934
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,559
but so it was you know deciding between

935
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:17,118
jamaican lion and cbd rx and from what i

936
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:19,119
said cbdrx you know might have looked

937
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,440
better but as i said it was maybe too

938
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,960
clean because when we started looking

939
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,960
at origin family so

940
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,279
so we realized that one gene that we

941
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,400
found in in the other genomes was absent

942
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,519
from cbdrx so is it something real maybe

943
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,000
cbdrx is missing that gene so we haven't

944
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,559
looked into that uh or

945
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,039
has it been you know clean a little bit

946
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:45,358
too much so they try to remove you know

947
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,920
repetitive elements from it and by

948
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,239
accident they they removed

949
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,960
uh that gene so it's not it's not clear

950
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,479
so

951
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,639
we kind of decided to move forward with

952
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,480
more than one genome and then we decided

953
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,759
okay so we're just going to add the

954
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,519
other two

955
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,359
that were available at the time so

956
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,440
finola which was also interesting

957
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,119
because it was hemp so you know it was

958
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,280
maybe a little bit different and then

959
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,320
jamaican lion there was also a male

960
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,440
version

961
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,039
um

962
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,440
so we decided to add that as well

963
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,199
because then we had finola and jamaican

964
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,320
lion males

965
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,239
uh so two males three females so just to

966
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,480
see if there could be differences as

967
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,358
well you know with the y chromosome and

968
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,599
the x chromosome

969
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,960
and did you find any difference there oh

970
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,720
well there were there were some

971
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,079
differences but you know

972
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,799
at this stage

973
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,280
uh is it you know real biological

974
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,039
differences or are they

975
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,800
different that are caused by you know

976
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,159
technical uh

977
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,480
aspect of you know some genomes being uh

978
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,480
better than others so for sure i would

979
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,920
say that purple kush

980
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,960
uh finola as well so you know

981
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,119
they were showing a lot of um

982
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,039
errors in the sequences when we were

983
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,000
looking at the genes like if we would

984
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,759
try to transcribe those genes

985
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,079
they would not transcribe well into

986
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,200
proteins because they add you know some

987
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,039
extra

988
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:13,039
some extra letters or some missing

989
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,440
letters and again

990
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,400
we talk well maybe it's a reality maybe

991
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,320
those genes have been inactivated in

992
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,400
those plans but then when we looked at

993
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,559
other data from the same plan so we had

994
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,280
a look at some transcriptomic data from

995
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,599
from those plans and we see that those

996
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,359
uh differences were not there so clearly

997
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,480
it was an error during the assembly

998
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,559
process so

999
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,119
those two had more problems i would say

1000
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,358
they were more fragmented as well so

1001
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,680
uh it was um

1002
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,239
so for those two it was

1003
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:47,039
easier to say that we would prefer not

1004
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,479
to work with those two maybe they will

1005
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,358
get better at some point i don't know if

1006
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,320
they're still trying to you know uh

1007
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,199
to to make them cleaner or to make them

1008
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,160
better

1009
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:00,239
uh but for the other two it really the

1010
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:03,279
difference that we talked so maybe cbdr

1011
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:05,598
is being too clean but jamaican lion

1012
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,119
i don't know maybe still too repetitive

1013
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,320
you know it's hard to come with the

1014
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,320
perfect genome

1015
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,200
and so how does

1016
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,519
the

1017
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,838
the quality of reference genome that

1018
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,519
that we were working with in cannabis

1019
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,719
compared to some of these other crops

1020
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:25,599
are we are we still very far behind

1021
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,759
uh we're not that far behind i mean

1022
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,039
i think we're we're certainly getting

1023
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,520
there it's just a matter of uh of the

1024
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,279
community you know deciding on which one

1025
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,199
is their reference and then we start

1026
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,400
building on that one

1027
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,719
um

1028
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,760
i think one of the problem we add is

1029
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,838
that you know and it's not only for i

1030
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,920
mean it's the same for all crops and i

1031
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,320
would say for all organisms you know

1032
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,240
people it's so easy right now to

1033
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,440
sequence things to sequence complete

1034
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,759
genomes

1035
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,679
people will sequence it the quality is

1036
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,480
not good but how we're still going to

1037
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:00,239
you know

1038
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,440
upload it onto

1039
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,799
ncbi and so you end up having access to

1040
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,159
a lot of

1041
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,318
genomes but the quality is not there and

1042
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,799
then if you try to work with those then

1043
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,199
it it's you start with a big you know a

1044
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,839
big bias in your study because you try

1045
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,519
to predict genes but if the genome is

1046
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,159
not complete then you will miss and

1047
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,960
genes will lead you to erroneous

1048
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,039
conclusions so it's important to have a

1049
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,039
good reference genome but i think we i

1050
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,960
think we have we have maybe two right

1051
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,358
now so i think we're

1052
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,599
we're getting there yeah for sure

1053
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,440
yeah but to your point it we sort of

1054
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,119
need to choose a gold standard so

1055
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,559
everyone's working off the same

1056
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,200
reference correct

1057
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,199
yeah but then it leads us to you know

1058
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,000
maybe the other problem that we have is

1059
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,480
that

1060
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,880
usually uh when you have a reference

1061
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,599
genome for another crop so

1062
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,920
that plant that you know was used to

1063
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,880
create that reference genome is also

1064
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,440
accessible to scientists so people can

1065
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,200
share that plant or that actu accession

1066
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,358
and so they will conduct studies on that

1067
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,919
same plant from which the genome was

1068
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:09,119
obtained and right now i mean it's not a

1069
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,720
matter that

1070
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,559
people don't want to share that they

1071
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,679
cannot share the plan because it's

1072
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,799
forbidden

1073
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,879
so jamaican lion i mean i'm sure that

1074
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,560
people would like to get their ends on

1075
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,720
it but right now especially between

1076
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,880
countries so from canada we cannot

1077
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,719
import from the us

1078
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,519
and i'm not sure you guys could export

1079
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:32,000
anyway uh so it's it's very a big

1080
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,280
problem so when even going further so

1081
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,199
you know

1082
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,319
most crops they have those germplasm

1083
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:40,159
repositories you know that

1084
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,239
that scientists have access to so they

1085
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,399
have all those different accessions land

1086
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,039
races sometimes mutants

1087
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,880
uh or sometimes mapping populations and

1088
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,199
that's how that's how the scientific

1089
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,039
community will move forward more rapidly

1090
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,679
but we don't we don't have that for

1091
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:55,679
cannabis yet

1092
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,719
so winding down here for the for the

1093
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,759
purposes of

1094
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:06,159
maybe breeding out some of these mlo

1095
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,680
genes that are causing susceptibility

1096
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,598
where do we go from here what are sort

1097
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,679
of the next steps

1098
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,599
well what i just talked about so if we

1099
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,118
could have access to more plants you

1100
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,359
know more more

1101
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,440
uh you know a lot of because right now

1102
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,838
we know that what's available in the

1103
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,599
commercial space is still very limited

1104
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,719
from a genetic point of view so we know

1105
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,920
that there are

1106
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,279
huge

1107
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,559
like yeah there is a lot more variation

1108
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,640
elsewhere

1109
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:35,920
so we need to to get our hands on that

1110
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:38,318
and see if that mlo based resistance

1111
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,400
maybe already exists within

1112
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,960
that germplasm

1113
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,358
if it doesn't exist then maybe we need

1114
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,000
to create it so we have access now to

1115
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,318
some biotechnological tools like crispr

1116
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,119
to do some genome editing but those

1117
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,960
tools are not working for cannabis now

1118
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,680
so i know a lot of people are trying to

1119
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,920
develop those tools but once we get them

1120
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,919
it will be and i'm not talking only

1121
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,639
about mlo here

1122
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,280
but you know for any trade that we

1123
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,679
will discover maybe a you know a link

1124
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,079
between a genotype and a phenotype let's

1125
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:14,639
talk about you know a trichome formation

1126
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,880
or flowering or

1127
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,759
other types of disease resistance so you

1128
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,079
know we we see correlation between the

1129
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,240
genomic data and the and and what we

1130
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,560
observe of the plant but we need to

1131
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,879
confirm those by you know inactivating

1132
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,639
genes or over expressing genes so some

1133
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,318
functional studies but

1134
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:34,559
right now we don't have the tools to do

1135
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,159
that so that's where where

1136
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,199
we're lagging or where there is a

1137
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,960
bottleneck right now

1138
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,639
do you worry about how the cannabis

1139
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,400
community might accept crispr

1140
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,279
uh well you know

1141
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,800
maybe

1142
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,319
so

1143
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,519
that's where also we that's why i always

1144
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:57,759
like to you know have both words so we

1145
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:00,000
develop the biotechnological tools but

1146
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,000
at the same time we try to explore as

1147
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,400
much as possible you know the natural

1148
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,800
variation that that we have

1149
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,880
and then if if the community really

1150
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,079
doesn't want to hear about crispr then

1151
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,160
maybe we can find some alternative that

1152
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,240
have been accepted by the the the

1153
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,118
organic farming world so when we talk

1154
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:18,318
about

1155
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,880
uh

1156
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:23,358
traditional muted mutagenesis so you

1157
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,559
know we have the the

1158
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,719
pink ruby grapefruit which was created

1159
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,719
that way but you can still grow it like

1160
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,959
organically so

1161
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,959
to me crispr is not different from that

1162
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,240
it's even better but

1163
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,480
we'll go with what people accept

1164
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:42,399
all right well it seems like the

1165
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,719
regulations though are really an

1166
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,639
impediment to really making a dent in

1167
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:49,118
this and many other

1168
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,400
um breeding breakthroughs that we could

1169
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,000
be making

1170
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,480
yeah for sure but you know at the same

1171
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,358
time you know doing research on cannabis

1172
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,480
was not even possible 10 years ago so

1173
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:03,679
things are moving fast so maybe those

1174
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,440
those impediments will also fall in the

1175
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,679
near future

1176
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,960
let's hope so so

1177
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,799
um

1178
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,159

j-o-l-y so that's my username there

1190
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,358
so i i don't tweet that often but you

1191
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,760
know when i tweet it's usually because

1192
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,920
we have a new paper or something so

1193
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,400
that's a good way to know uh what we're

1194
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,599
doing so we we published quite a few in

1195
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,160
in the last

1196
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,440
few months so we're also working on you

1197
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,920
know

1198
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,280
looking at beneficial bacteria or they

1199
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,318
can promote

1200
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,880
uh

1201
00:45:54,318 --> 00:46:00,318
cannabis growth and stuff like that so

1202
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,880
there's a you know it's not only very

1203
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,960
hard to understand genomic stuff but we

1204
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,358
also do other type of stuff so and

1205
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,400
hopefully we'll continue to to look at

1206
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:12,559
that in cannabis so and not only disease

1207
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,200
resistance so you know we're interested

1208
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:18,880
in looking into other traits

1209
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,799
