from that clinical trial

66
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:38,239
what makes diabetic neuropathic pain a

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,160
good candidate for cannabinoid therapies

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,599

cannabinoids via a water-soluble tablet

72
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,159
why there are not more clinical trials

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,800

00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,000

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,040
consumers can use

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,120

106

good afternoon deb thanks for joining us

107
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,519
hi ben thanks for having me absolutely

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
and it's always

109
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,599
it's great to catch up with you um i see

110
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,959
you a lot out on the conference circuit

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,879
you being a

112
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,758
frequent presenter and a very good one a

113
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,879
former canmed presenter

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,560
but obviously given the circumstances

115
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,079
we haven't been out there on the circuit

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,959
so i wanted to

117
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,839
maybe ask you how has not going to

118
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,279
conferences

119
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,000
and kind of being out there kind of

120
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:51,439
helped you i don't know maybe refocus

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,600
or concentrate more on other work

122
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,680
yeah so this whole coveted pandemic

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360
shutdown thing has been uh

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,038
kind of a double-edged sword you know

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,639
the good part about not having to travel

126
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,560
outside of your home is that you have a

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,360
lot of time to

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,439
um dedicate to doing all kinds of

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,000
different projects and no excuses for

130
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,120
not doing

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,120
them and then the the the bad part is is

132
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,800
one you you miss that collaboration that

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
face-to-face time with

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,240
with people where you know a certain you

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,400
know

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,000
a simple hello could lead down a path of

137
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,758
a great idea

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,079
and so the challenge is

139
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
trying to recreate that in creative ways

140
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,839
you know so i think the

141
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,240
the internet was a positive regarding

142
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,560
that you know these podcasts are great

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,439
but i think when it comes to

144
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,160
face-to-face

145
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,120
time with people i think you know as

146
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,280
humans we're

147
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,038
we're meant to be social creatures and

148
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,559
and it's you know that part's been kind

149
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,038
of challenging

150
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
um i did get a lot of work done though

151
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,839
staying home

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,759
um uh and and the challenge with that

153
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,439
also is when to shut down because you

154
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,479
know your workspace and your home space

155
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,680
become

156
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,758
sort of uh and one you know an amorphous

157
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,199
one

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,840
yeah you definitely need to keep that

159
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,800
balance and you make a great point about

160
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,519
sort of the

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,800
the collaboration in in being in person

162
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,639
with people and

163
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
and thankfully it seems like there's

164
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,120
more in-person events being announced

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,360
and

166
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,079
of course we're planning to hold canmed

167
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,520
this fall out there in pasadena so

168
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,038
you know fingers crossed everything

169
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,240
keeps trending in the right direction

170
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,759
and

171
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,000
we'll get to talk to each other in

172
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
person pretty soon but

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,399
but until then we get to talk uh on the

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,199
podcast here and i'm excited to talk

175
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,159
with you

176
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,080
about a a new clinical trial uh that you

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,120
guys just published about where you were

178
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,240
looking into treating diabetic

179
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,280
neuropathic pain with cbd which is

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
is really interesting so um let's dive

181
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,198
into it and maybe the best place to

182
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
start

183
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,840
is to kind of let's talk about what

184
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,918
exactly is diabetic diabetic

185
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,439
peripheral neuropathy and why did you

186
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,038
think that would be a good target for

187
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:08,160
cannabinoid therapies so yeah this was

188
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,439
an incredible opportunity to to do with

189
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
this study

190
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,478
um we chose diabetic peripheral

191
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,319
neuropathy

192
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:19,839
because it's a kind of a nerve damage

193
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,120
caused by diabetes elevated

194
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,598
chronic elevation of blood sugar

195
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
and um it's quite debilitating it leads

196
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,680
to numbness

197
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
loss of sensation pain and usually they

198
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,120
call

199
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,839
this a stocking glove distribution so

200
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,918
it's in their

201
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:40,478
people's feets and and legs and hands

202
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,000
um and sadly it's the most common

203
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,878
complication

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,079
of diabetes it affects upwards of 50 of

205
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,560
patients

206
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,959
and why did yeah i know it's crazy and

207
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,160
why do we think it was a great target

208
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,519
or potential target to to explore is

209
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
because there's a lot of

210
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,878
basic science research you know super

211
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,800
smart people

212
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,919
are are creating these animal models um

213
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,038
to look at different types of pain

214
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,719
and they there was a basic science

215
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,120
research that shows

216
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,000
um in a glycine-induced neuropathic pain

217
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,120
model that

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,680
cbd seemed to have had a reduction in

219
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,879
pain

220
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,360
in this model um sarah jane ward at a

221
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,400
temple university

222
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,759
my mentor and somebody i admire hugely

223
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,839
looked at cbd to prevent or reduce

224
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,440
um paclitaxel-induced peripheral

225
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,958
neuropathic pain

226
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
so from chemotherapy and so diabetes

227
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,958
because it's

228
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,199
rampant and widespread um

229
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,039
and is so debilitating with with this

230
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,160
painful thing we thought this would be

231
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:52,399
an interesting um target for cbd

232
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,519
oh excellent so it seems like there was

233
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,080
already some

234
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,560
some groundwork laid um through others

235
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,120
who had

236
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,639
kind of been investigating this um at a

237
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
more um

238
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,958
uh plant model level does that have that

239
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,518
right i'm not plant i'm sorry animal

240
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,958
animal model yeah i like plants but yes

241
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,360
definitely

242
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,518
definitely at the at the animal you know

243
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,639
bench top model and there's also

244
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,480
a lot of what people like to

245
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,159
sort of turn their nose at but anecdotal

246
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,920
anecdotal evidence

247
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:27,039
clinically where people seem to respond

248
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,679
to cannabinoids broadly in cbd

249
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,838
specifically so we thought that we would

250
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,639
take a look at it

251
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
great and so what are some of the common

252
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,039
medications

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,720
used to treat uh dpn and

254
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,159
you know what are their side effects is

255
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
is that another reason that

256
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,759
can uh cannabinoids might be a good

257
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,040
candidate here right

258
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,600
so some of the well the the

259
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,360
the main treatment is to try to get some

260
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,920
tight control

261
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,759
um with blood sugar to try to prevent it

262
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,439
but you know sometimes it's it's a

263
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,399
challenge especially if people don't eat

264
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,360
right and

265
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,360
don't understand what the mechanisms are

266
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,879
of why they have diabetes and how to

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,519
prevent therefore those

268
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,679
spikes of blood sugar and uh the

269
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,360
chronicity of it

270
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:20,479
and and so the only two fda

271
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,600
uh approved drugs or lyrica or

272
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,440
pregabalin

273
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,959
and cymbalta otherwise known as

274
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,920
daloxetine

275
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,879
and um they're they're tough drugs to

276
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,399
take i mean

277
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,120
and they have a ton of side effects they

278
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,759
can something is you know

279
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
minor until it affects you is dizziness

280
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,919
and nausea

281
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,879
and extreme fatigue you can have weight

282
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,199
gain

283
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,120
you can have amnesia it can affect your

284
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,640
platelets it can cause heart failure so

285
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,799
we're getting into some

286
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,838
you know more serious of these side

287
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,679
effects

288
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,640
um seizures and these also carry a black

289
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,359
box warning

290
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:02,399
of of um suicide and suicidal ideation

291
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,240
and so yeah i mean you always as a

292
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,839
physician want to balance

293
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,278
efficacy of a drug with side effects

294
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,120
right because what good is it if

295
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,278
something works if at the end of the day

296
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,480
it makes you kill yourself

297
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,278
right you know and as we in

298
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,480
in the cannabinoid or endocannabinoid

299
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,838
industry

300
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,480
have come to learn is that

301
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,160
for the most part when taken prudently

302
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,519
cannabinoids don't

303
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:34,719
you know have serious adverse

304
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,720
effects or events

305
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,600
certainly certainly um and so one thing

306
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,000
that you mentioned there about

307
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,120
sort of what causes this pain i just

308
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,759
wanted to make sure that i understood

309
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,919
that

310
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,519
correctly is is it something that's

311
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,759
caused by um

312
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,759
you know for lack of a better term like

313
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,200
poor management of diet or

314
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,958
blood sugar is this something that can

315
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,320
be prevented if

316
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00,159
if folks are managing things properly

317
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,079
you know it depends i guess on what that

318
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,919
management looks like right

319
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,919
so if you are someone who

320
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:13,519
eats garbage and and

321
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,958
just takes a pill to sort of counteract

322
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,679
that

323
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,518
i think that the glycosylation of these

324
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,958
nerves is what's happening that leads to

325
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,320
this damage of the nerve of these

326
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,239
peripheral nerves

327
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,360
um will continue and i've read studies

328
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,839
that even

329
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,839
slightly elevated but chronic slight

330
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,360
elevation of blood sugar

331
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,399
can also lead to these um

332
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,879
neuropathic pain issues so

333
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,039
really it's it's got to be looked at in

334
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,320
a more holistic way where

335
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:49,439
you take charge of what what you eat

336
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,079
and so when i take care of patients who

337
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,680
are tired of of having diabetes and

338
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,078
taking medication

339
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,239
i transition them to a whole food all

340
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,919
plant no added oil no processed food

341
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,720
diet

342
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,838
to help manage their diabetes and the

343
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,879
majority of

344
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,079
of my type 2 diabetics

345
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,399
um are able to reduce or

346
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,919
or replace all of their medicines just

347
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,559
by diet alone

348
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,519
wow that's because they're not spiking

349
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,759
their blood sugar

350
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,639
and sort of creating this nerve damage

351
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,240
exactly and

352
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,720
and it's weird because you know when in

353
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,399
medical school we're taught about

354
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,720
diabetes being a problem with blood

355
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,759
sugar that's sort of like a

356
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,120
um an end result but really the primary

357
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,240
result is

358
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,360
diabetes is because fat

359
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,839
blocks insulin's ability to take

360
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,199
sugar that we need to have for function

361
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,600
and energy our brain

362
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,559
functions on glucose it's not like you

363
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,759
don't need

364
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,319
glucose you just need it in a wholesome

365
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,439
way

366
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,519
not in a refined sugar kind of way but

367
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,360
the real cause of diabetes for people

368
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,039
who are predisposed to

369
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,480
having this is is that fat inside a cell

370
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:07,519
blocks insulin's ability to bring

371
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,920
sugar in for metabolism

372
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,720
i know right and so because of that then

373
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,278
you see

374
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,320
a blood a blood sugar spike in your

375
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,240
blood because

376
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,440
it's in your blood and not in the cells

377
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,959
where it belongs

378
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,760
right okay very interesting

379
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,638
okay so now that we've sort of set the

380
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,958
table there so

381
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:32,240
what were the results um of your study

382
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:35,679
incredible i mean

383
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,159
yeah it i mean so so we had 31 subjects

384
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,198
with

385
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,559
um diabetes this was an open label

386
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,240
meaning

387
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,799
i knew that they had to draw that they

388
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,440
were getting cbd they knew that they

389
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,559
were getting

390
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,920
cbd and um

391
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,838
we had them use a smartphone app we

392
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,639
designed a series of questions looking

393
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,800
at a whole bunch of different endpoints

394
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,560
um one is of course safety you know to

395
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,719
make sure that that this preparation was

396
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,799
safe with no adverse events

397
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,680
um and then the second is efficacy

398
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,120
you know what was a pain scale score did

399
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,759
it go down

400
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,560
and was it statistically significant and

401
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,879
the answer was yes

402
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,319
it was statistically significant and

403
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,360
because this was an

404
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,920
open label i didn't

405
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,000
have anyone get off their lyrica or

406
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,479
cymbalta or any of the off-label

407
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,600
medications that are often used or

408
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
prescribed

409
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,519
for this treatment of uh diabetic

410
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,519
neuropathic pain

411
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,600
because if they're they qualify

412
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,078
with a pain scale score an npr score

413
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,519
from zero to ten of a five or greater

414
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,679
than they made the grade and they can be

415
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
on it you know in spite of the fact that

416
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,799
they were still taking these meds

417
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:57,039
so we had you know

418
00:15:52,799 --> 00:16:00,479
more subjects on these pain meds

419
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:03,519
still with an average pain scale score

420
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,199
of of close to seven

421
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,320
on medication and we even compared it

422
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,479
with their with with with patients

423
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,399
who weren't on these medicines with

424
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,120
their average pain scale score

425
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,000
close to seven and they both

426
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,039
statistically significantly dropped

427
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
by almost half

428
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,039
yeah that's that's pretty remarkable um

429
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,519
it's huge

430
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,360
it's it's huge and and when you look at

431
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,799
mprs score

432
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,560
um and something like diabetic

433
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,519
neuropathic pain there's something

434
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,039
called

435
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,399
what is um minimally clinically

436
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:44,000
significant

437
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:47,360
so what makes patients say

438
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,240
that was worth my while and generally

439
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,600
speaking they

440
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,278
you know an nprs of a

441
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,278
a reduction of two points

442
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:04,879
is clinically significant for patients

443
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:08,879
and we were down by three

444
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,079
as an average right and that i was going

445
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,120
to ask you about that because when i was

446
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,639
reading through the

447
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,958
the um the study there um the results

448
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,000
were

449
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,839
presented as an average um were there

450
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,759
any uh participants who had

451
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,119
a reduction of pain so much that it was

452
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,558
zero or

453
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,959
is that yeah yeah three

454
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,079
that that's that's incredible it's it's

455
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,759
that's what i'm saying like these

456
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,879
results were incredible

457
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:40,960
absolutely um incredible and

458
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:44,240
and the results were um

459
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,840
robust enough for us to say

460
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,558
what if we do this again

461
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,240
but we do it with a placebo control

462
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,440
double blind

463
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,400
randomized trial and so that's what we

464
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,840
did

465
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,559
and literally last week we just closed

466
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,759
out

467
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,759
51 subjects

468
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,879
double blind randomized trial placebo

469
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,160
controlled

470
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,200
and now it's the data sets are with the

471
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:20,000
statisticians so now we wait

472
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,960
okay so no no indication or

473
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,440
any idea of how the data looks or yeah

474
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,960
so there is an indication

475
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,320
for a statistically significant

476
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:36,400
reduction in pain

477
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,079
and we took people off their payments

478
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,759
wow well that's that's certainly

479
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,599
significant and i want to

480
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,279
go ahead please smart people the smart

481
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,480
statisticians to get their hands on it

482
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,759
so this is uh

483
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,558
you know another story for another

484
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:52,480
podcast hopefully and another manuscript

485
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:56,000
but um there are you know there are

486
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,120
um some indications that show

487
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,119
similar type results

488
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,519
yeah that's that's certainly remarkable

489
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,720
and another thing that i read

490
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,759
um in the study is that i think

491
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,000
and if i read it curricula you could

492
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,798
certainly tell me that some of the

493
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,880
participants

494
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,918
actually wanted to stop using their

495
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,919
medications

496
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:20,000
um but i think you advise them not to

497
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,520
just because under the terms of the

498
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
study like you said you wanted to keep

499
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,720
them

500
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,600
you know consistent or keep them on the

501
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,400
medications

502
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,119
consistently um which certainly makes

503
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,519
sense but

504
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,239
i was curious that now with that study

505
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,079
over

506
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,440
do you know how did any of those

507
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,558
participants actually

508
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,120
stop using their medications so good

509
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,519
question because

510
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,959
we're a clinical trials company per se

511
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,319
there's no

512
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,440
they're not patients of ours you know so

513
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:55,038
they're we don't follow up beyond

514
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,360
you know what our our protocol

515
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,200
is so i don't know that but i would

516
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,678
imagine

517
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,798
if i were one of those patients i

518
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,480
certainly would

519
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,960
would replace my medications or augment

520
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,319
my

521
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:14,319
medications with cbd after the use of

522
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:17,200
this yeah if if for no other reason then

523
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,319
uh what we've touched on before that you

524
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
know some of those

525
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,439
side effects from those other

526
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,038
medications are

527
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,400
pretty significant and um

528
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,279
conversely i read also in your study

529
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,679
that

530
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,759
none of the participants rep reported

531
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,640
any adverse revi

532
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,519
excuse me reported any adverse events

533
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,640
from

534
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,200
the cbd which i have to think that

535
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,880
um that's very uncommon in a clinical

536
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,319
trial is that fair to say

537
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,679
it is very fair to say i mean

538
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,158
generally speaking you know it's fair to

539
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,360
say

540
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,919
you know for anything that people

541
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,119
always have some sort of an issue with

542
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,919
something

543
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,719
um so yes it was very rare and again

544
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,200
that's why

545
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,558
you know this was a really informative

546
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,919
trial

547
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,839
albeit an open label um

548
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,759
and so that's why we wanted to see what

549
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,240
would happen what if

550
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,440
we did this again you know everybody

551
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,720
blinded

552
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,720
and placebo controlled

553
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,759
yeah absolutely and you know kind of

554
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,120
just going back to the whole

555
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,240
idea of there being no adverse events

556
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,678
know it's sort of something that comes

557
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,599
up a lot when i talk with with

558
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,919
physicians or

559
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,079
clinicians in general is that you know

560
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,559
that's one of the great things about

561
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,359
about cbd or cannabinoid therapies is

562
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,678
that

563
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,839
really the adverse events the likelihood

564
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,240
of an adverse event is very low

565
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,519
not that it's not that it's zero but it

566
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,120
is so low that

567
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,000
um it's often a good idea to at least

568
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,678
try it

569
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,759
and you know and if it doesn't work for

570
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,759
you then kind of no harm no foul

571
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,679
but um that's one thing about

572
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,879
cannabinoid therapies that's

573
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,480
um pretty remarkable absolutely i call

574
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
it like the therapeutic order of

575
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,640
operations

576
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,000
right so first you know change your diet

577
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,600
and lifestyle

578
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,038
take away all the things that are

579
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,319
adversely impacting

580
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:21,359
your your health and then

581
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,639
if you still have a condition

582
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,558
start adding on things with the least

583
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,240
amount of side effects

584
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,879
so i'm not saying that pharmaceuticals

585
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,720
are terrible but i'm saying that

586
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,880
there are other things including

587
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,759
cannabinoids

588
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,840
that should be tried first before we get

589
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,759
to something because you want to have

590
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,000
something that's effective

591
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,759
with the least amount of side effects

592
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,679
right

593
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:51,359
right yeah so with that i'd sort of i'm

594
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,679
curious to talk with you about

595
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,558
sort of the medicine itself that you

596
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,640
were using to treat these patients

597
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,918
and if i understand correctly the cbd

598
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,880
treatment you studied was

599
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,759
actually in a tablet form which kind of

600
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,280
struck me as

601
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:10,400
rather rare for cannabis treatments

602
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:13,440
is that true well i mean there's

603
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,798
oral ingestibles of of all sorts right

604
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,919
so um the owner of the company pg

605
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:24,240
forma had the idea

606
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:28,240
that he wanted to create a

607
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,759
administration form that

608
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,919
doctors would be comfortable with and

609
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,000
familiar with patients would be

610
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,799
comfortable with and familiar with

611
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,558
that it would be an ease of use they

612
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,200
would be able to titrate it

613
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,158
you know up or down depending upon the

614
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,278
the effects

615
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,480
of the of the of the medicine on the

616
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,798
indication

617
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:54,079
and so it's it's rare that

618
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,278
it's a water solubilized iteration of

619
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,199
cbd

620
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,480
it goes under your tongue it rapidly

621
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,360
dissolves

622
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,159
and so you know lots and lots of people

623
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,798
use

624
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,240
a sublingual version that's oil-based

625
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,200
and dropper-based

626
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,159
and so this was formulated in a tablet

627
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,038
form to

628
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,520
to look familiar and feel familiar and

629
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,440
look

630
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,798
like real medicine that it is right

631
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,278
no it was something that came up when i

632
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:25,440
was talking with uh dr peter grinspoon

633
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:27,919
on um an earlier podcast he was pretty

634
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,919
adamant that you know if we want

635
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,640
cannabis to be treated like a medicine

636
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,159
it should look like a medicine um you

637
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,960
know

638
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,120
to be sort of treating conditions with

639
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,600
with gummy bears or things like that

640
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,558
it just doesn't it doesn't fit so i

641
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,719
think

642
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:47,038
moving more towards a traditional look

643
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,759
would certainly help at least

644
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,960
with adoption from folks who are maybe

645
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,519
not as comfortable

646
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,480
with cannabis absolutely you know i

647
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,839
always say i don't

648
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,720
like to vilify any cannabinoid nor do i

649
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,079
want to

650
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,159
vilify any administration form

651
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,359
for sure i can assure you that as a

652
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,278
physician i've never written a

653
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:12,558
prescription for a brownie

654
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:16,240
right however if that's the only way

655
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:19,359
someone with horrific anxiety

656
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,919
you know will take a cannabinoid and

657
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,918
that cannabinoid seems to work

658
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,038
for that anxiety i'm just using as an

659
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,480
example

660
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:31,519
then gosh why not you know but

661
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,960
there are subset of people who look at

662
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:38,319
cannabis and think of it as

663
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,038
you know um something that you know

664
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,720
stoners use and they think it's only

665
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,879
about smoking and there's no way they

666
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,960
would ever use this

667
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
you know without remembering that this

668
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,319
was in the u.s pharmacopoeia

669
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:56,080
up until the early 1940s and

670
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,480
my grandfather a pharmacist probably you

671
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,879
know

672
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,919
had alcohol extractions and of you know

673
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,240
tinctures of

674
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,759
of cannabinoids on a shelf that he gave

675
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,200
people

676
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,919
so you know everyone i i think the

677
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,038
beauty of

678
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,360
of this industry is that

679
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,038
there's something for everyone you know

680
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,839
if somebody's

681
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:20,240
um inclination is to say i want to get

682
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,639
closest to the plan as possible and

683
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,679
feels that vaporizing or inhalation of

684
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,480
some sort is

685
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,320
is the way to go then and it works fine

686
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,798
you know if

687
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,759
somebody wants to say i'm not really

688
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,400
excited about

689
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,000
that method of administration these

690
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,679
sublingual tablets make the most sense

691
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,599
to me

692
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,679
i i i'm we're right there for him

693
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,759
yeah absolutely and i think at the end

694
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,320
of the day we want to um

695
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,919
we want to make this as accessible as

696
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,278
possible to as many different people as

697
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,320
possible right

698
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,960
well i i think that's what we want for

699
00:26:54,319 --> 00:27:00,639
the medical industry right i think

700
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,679
it it makes sense and again just based

701
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,200
on

702
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,000
the safety profile and the and you know

703
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,840
and and potential

704
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,798
efficacy absolutely

705
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,158
so more about um this tablet and what

706
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,879
you used in the study

707
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,600
um i understand it was it was cbd but i

708
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,679
was curious

709
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,839
were there any other cannabinoids or

710
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,480
terpenoids sort of in that formulation

711
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,480
or was it

712
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,599
just cbd only so it is a proprietary

713
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,798
blend

714
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:34,398
so i can't disclose but it had

715
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,759
curated terpenes and uh some secret

716
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,879
sauce

717
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,879
and uh cbd

718
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,159
excellent excellent so i mean

719
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,599
i guess the obligatory question about

720
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,080
the entourage effect

721
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,839
so i i take it that if there are other

722
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,480
cannabinoids and terpenoids in there

723
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,720
then

724
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,599
um it's certainly playing a role at

725
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,640
least um

726
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,798
in the benefits here so

727
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,759
i think we we can all agree about the

728
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,639
synergistic

729
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,000
effects you know reign supreme even in

730
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,640
traditional medicine

731
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,038
you know as an anesthesiologist we would

732
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,200
use

733
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,440
a bunch of different medications to um

734
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,519
[Music]

735
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,798
induce somebody you know for general

736
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,839
anesthesia

737
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,720
as opposed to one medicine and just use

738
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,759
a whole lot of it

739
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,079
again to reduce side effects of one

740
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:29,278
medication so synergistic effects of

741
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,879
of different molecules make

742
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,480
a lot of sense and have always made a

743
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,240
lot of sense

744
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,440
um i kind of struggle with

745
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,519
if you have an oral ingestible you know

746
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,558
what happens in the stomach when

747
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:48,558
you know it's a ph of less than two and

748
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:50,158
um hydrochloric acid is there

749
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,359
and then it goes through the digestive

750
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,120
process and i think about

751
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,599
you know we eat a lot of terpenes all

752
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,239
day long in fruits and vegetables and

753
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,959
herbs

754
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,960
and spices

755
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,678
i i don't know if in that method of

756
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,960
administration

757
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,919
if it matters as much as it would with

758
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,440
inhalation like

759
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,720
aromatherapy right or

760
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,880
a sublingual where you where you

761
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,640
it is potentially absorbed into the

762
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,080
systemic circulation

763
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,840
bypassing that that gi tract in that

764
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,839
you know metabolism piece

765
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,159
yeah that is that is interesting it

766
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,278
hadn't really struck me until you

767
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,880
you mentioned it that um you're right we

768
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,798
we are ingesting all different types of

769
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,880
foods that have different terpenes and

770
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,200
different compounds in them and

771
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,520
if we are if we all agree that there is

772
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,480
an entourage effect going on here how

773
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,398
could

774
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,159
you know eating an edible after you eat

775
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:51,839
a cheeseburger different than

776
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,760
be different than if you ate it after

777
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,558
you had a salad um

778
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:59,038
something i'd never considered before um

779
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,639
or augmented better with a salad

780
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,200
well let's just say the salad had some

781
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,038
kind of olive oil on it so people aren't

782
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,640
saying you know to themselves listening

783
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,319
to this podcast

784
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,399
oh well it's the fat content of the

785
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,839
cheeseburger and by the way

786
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,158
disclosure i'm not advising a

787
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,519
cheeseburger but that content of the

788
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,200
cheeseburger that allows for better

789
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,639
absorption of the

790
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,000
terpenes in cannabinoids um but

791
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:27,600
but still i think we can agree

792
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,960
that you know cannabis is a very

793
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,158
efficient

794
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,880
manufacturer of terpenes

795
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,679
and other plant sources have a greater

796
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,760
amount

797
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,038
and yet you know i i just don't know

798
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,278
you know this is something that keeps me

799
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,000
up at night and someday i would love to

800
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:45,599
run

801
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,038
you know clinical trials somebody wants

802
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,038
to fund me doing this

803
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,879
you know looking exactly at this

804
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,798
question

805
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,559
yeah we just don't know it's something i

806
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,519
hear a lot talking to

807
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,558
folks in this field which um is always

808
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,519
exciting

809
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,119
and um you know if nothing else it's job

810
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,519
security right we still have a lot to

811
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,199
learn

812
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,120
and on the and on the topic of clinical

813
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,720
trials you know another thing that

814
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,038
always comes up when i talk with people

815
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,640
about cannabis and cannabis medicine is

816
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,720
you know we need more clinical trials

817
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,519
there's not enough clinical trials

818
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,399
um so now you've completed one here and

819
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,759
you have another

820
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:25,199
double-blind study in the works um

821
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,079
why do you feel like there aren't more

822
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,159
clinical trials being done now

823
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:35,439
so one they're difficult

824
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,799
they're expensive you have to be

825
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,038
clever enough to work around the legal

826
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:44,798
and regulatory landscape in a

827
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:47,599
using a federally illegal substance

828
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,398
you know and then there's covet right so

829
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,319
um of course

830
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:54,639
you know add that to the mix and and

831
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,839
i would also i mean expensive probably

832
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,480
should have been number one more than

833
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,119
difficult

834
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,079
i mean because there's always ways and

835
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,599
of figuring stuff

836
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,079
out if i did it you know i'm sure other

837
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,759
people can too but but it's expensive

838
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,599
and if you think about it

839
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,519
you know for the most part universities

840
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,599
don't want to touch it because

841
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,440
of federal funding and they're they're

842
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,639
nervous about it and anytime you onboard

843
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,798
a university

844
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,200
generally speaking it becomes very

845
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:22,558
cumbersome and a lot of red tape

846
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,000
um and businesses who

847
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,119
are you know cultivating processing and

848
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,038
selling

849
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:34,479
on a retail sales landscape

850
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:36,720
are busy doing that and

851
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,679
it's hard to monetize a clinical trial i

852
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,919
mean

853
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,798
pure green pharmaceuticals in the midst

854
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,759
of

855
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,720
of uh trying to fundraise to be able to

856
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,480
take these this

857
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,038
these pieces of information that we're

858
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,278
getting to the fda

859
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:52,240
to get an ind to make make a true

860
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,278
pharmaceutical

861
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,519
you know no differently than gw forma

862
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,960
and you know it's it's hard people

863
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,960
generally

864
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,120
don't put their money where their mouth

865
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,120
is

866
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,480
yeah no it's an it's unfortunate but

867
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,119
it's it's encouraging at least that

868
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,759
that you're managing to to get it done

869
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,639
and we

870
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,599
are seeing more or come around um so

871
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,480
hopefully that's a

872
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,278
that's a trend that continues right it's

873
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,120
not just me

874
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:26,240
it's you know pharma is um

875
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:26,639
was self-funded by the ceo for a long

876
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,880
time

877
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,278
and then through connections in the

878
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,399
largess of an investment company

879
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:37,278
out of pennsylvania go figure um

880
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:39,839
who believed in you know making real

881
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:39,839
medicine

882
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,599
right and now in terms of clinical

883
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,440
trials like are there

884
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,119
are there certain standards that must be

885
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,440
met to kind of perform like a

886
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,319
quote unquote proper clinical trial in

887
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,200
terms of

888
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,918
sample size selection criteria time

889
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,960
period

890
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,720
or things like that i ask because i mean

891
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,120
unfortunately in this space and i

892
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,759
imagine in any space there's sort of

893
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,398
there's pseudoscience there's you know

894
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,039
um

895
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,159
maybe some less scrupulous studies that

896
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,679
are out there that

897
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,838
folks might tout as being a

898
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,960
quote-unquote clinical trial but

899
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:20,639
maybe aren't um as

900
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,639
robust as as a proper one i wonder

901
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,159
if so are there some sort of like red

902
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,399
flags that consumers

903
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,200
might be able to kind of look for if if

904
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,039
there are folks

905
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,480
claiming to have performed a clinical

906
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,679
trial

907
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,159
so for sure there is i like the term

908
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,720
proper

909
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,000
proper clinical trial absolutely and

910
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,799
there are rules that

911
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
govern and standards that govern what a

912
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,919
clinical trial

913
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,679
is i mean people go to school for years

914
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,000
and years i studied

915
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,000
passed an exam and i'm actually a

916
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,199
certified principal investigator

917
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,440
as well as my other um my other initials

918
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:59,039
so i have cpi going for me

919
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,480
and you know it it's it's hard so yes

920
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,400
sample size is

921
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,480
calculated it's called power through

922
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,960
smart statisticians looking at

923
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,199
what the endpoints are and what the what

924
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,320
kinds of results you want to see

925
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:15,439
um and

926
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,320
and you need to have this gone through

927
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,280
like a

928
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,200
uh investigators review board to make

929
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,839
sure that it's ethical

930
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,199
and that somebody independent is sort of

931
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,199
overseeing

932
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,598
what the what the protocol is that

933
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,399
there's informed consents to make sure

934
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,240
that

935
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,680
subjects are protected their rights are

936
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,559
protected their health

937
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,919
in the event of an adverse event or even

938
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,119
just publishing

939
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,838
any of this stuff you know so there's a

940
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,599
site called

941
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:49,039
clinicaltrials.gov

942
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,160
it's it's um actually overseen by the

943
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,639
nih national

944
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,960
national institute of health so all of

945
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:58,559
our tax dollars are paying for this

946
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:02,000
that true robust clinical trials

947
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:04,320
have to list on that site

948
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,838
and it's not easy to do it is probably

949
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,359
one of the harder things i've done

950
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,279
and i've studied for board

951
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:12,400
certifications for many

952
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,599
many different medical um

953
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,160
specialties and and it's really

954
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,559
challenging to do this but every one of

955
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:24,000
our trials is list is irb approved and

956
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:26,159
listed on clinicaltrials.gov

957
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,440
and you can see those trials you can

958
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,480
google it google

959
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,200
you know my last name and you can see a

960
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,079
list of

961
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,039
of trials that you know we've got irb

962
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,560
approval for

963
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,719
and we're just waiting for funding or

964
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,679
we've completed or we're in the midst of

965
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,759
recruiting

966
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,598
so you can see all that and that would

967
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,440
be something that

968
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,480
um patients if they're interested in

969
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,280
looking at can also see

970
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,199
but most of these manufacturers are not

971
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,599
doing these things

972
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:58,639
and most of these publications are not

973
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,039
in a peer review medical journal

974
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,159
you know so it's kind of like a buyer

975
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,320
beware as well

976
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:09,440
and not to suggest that the information

977
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,240
that manufacturers garner from patients

978
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,519
that use

979
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,959
their products is not valuable certainly

980
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,599
is

981
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,400
but there's a difference between you

982
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,000
know

983
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,519
a patient survey and you know a

984
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
real robust clinical trial

985
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,960
absolutely yeah that that

986
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,760
clinicaltrials.gov that's that's a great

987
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,240
resource

988
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,240
um to certainly um

989
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,679
maybe vet some of these these things or

990
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,639
some of these claims or

991
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,399
or maybe just to to keep an eye on what

992
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,400
clinical trials are being done

993
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,160
in the space so i'll definitely provide

994
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,039
a link to that in the show notes so

995
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,719
people can uh

996
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:53,759
can check that out um all right so

997
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,519
i guess wrapping up here um i wanted to

998
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,800
give you an opportunity to

999
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,358
plug any um any websites any social

1000
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,839
media

1001
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,598
anything that you would like to um to

1002
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,358
let people know about so they can maybe

1003
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,039
learn more about the work you're doing

1004
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,679
or maybe connect with you

1005
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,639
the floor is yours sure so thank you so

1006
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,639
absolutely go on to

1007
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,639
pg pharma.co

1008
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,799
especially if you're an investor in the

1009
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,358
space that

1010
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:26,320
is excited about creating you know

1011
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:28,400
fda-approved pharmaceuticals

1012
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,720
because again like we you know with a

1013
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,000
shout out to what we said before

1014
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,759
some people would only take

1015
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,760
what they consider to be the gold

1016
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,280
standard of medicine which is

1017
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,000
you know found in a pharmacy fda

1018
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,519
approved with a thumbs up

1019
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and that's what we're trying to create

1020
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:55,039
so pgforma.co has has all the links to

1021
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,280
you know instagram or whatever and

1022
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:00,000
