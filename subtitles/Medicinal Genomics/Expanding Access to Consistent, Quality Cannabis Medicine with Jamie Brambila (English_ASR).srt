other plant-based medicines

106
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,359
the principal aspects of their mission

107
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,840
are to democratize plant-based medicine

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,319
and democratize the science taking the

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,079
complex pharmacological information and

110
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,560
breaking it down so everyone can

at cam in 2022 jaime will present a case

113
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,599
study in which the combined use of

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,319
cannabis psilocybin a ketogenic diet and

115
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,120
conventional oncology treatments induced

116
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,478
remission in a stage 4 metastatic breast

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
cancer patient

118
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,039
that patient just so happens to be

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,439
jamie's wife nicole

120
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,600
during our conversation we discuss the

121
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,439
lack of awareness and training amongst

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,919
physicians about the clinical use of

123
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,360
cannabis the enduring stigma around

124
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,240
cannabis use

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,400
how cannabis can be used to treat cancer

126
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,040
how jamie and nicole built the

127
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,039
infrastructure necessary to have access

128
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,199

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,800
pharmaceutical grade cannabis medicines

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,639
to treat her cancer

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,038
we also talk about the barriers that

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,000
prevent other patients from accessing

133
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,279
that same quality consistent cannabis

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,639
medicine

135
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,719
and finally we discussed the

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,199
collaborative project that jamie and

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,600
nicole have assembled to take cannabis

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,840
formulations against cancer through the

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,759
drug approval process

140
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,918

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
just uh

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,560
express my gratitude for being on your

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,479
podcast i think you really are doing a

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,280
great job on putting these podcasts

176
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,159
together for before the convention so

177
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,959
yeah

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,439
we got started in the uh cannabis space

179
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,758
back in 2016.

180
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,598
we had a small delivery service out in

181
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,840
southern california

182
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,399
and initially we had gotten into the

183
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,638
space because we thought it was a

184
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,598
a good business opportunity quickly we

185
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,639
found that that all that green rush uh

186
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:18,000
rhetoric was just an illusion

187
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,439
and we started um focusing on really

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,879
trying to help out people because we

189
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,199
started getting phone calls from people

190
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,279
that were in dire straits

191
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,840
looking for answers with cannabis

192
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:32,000
mothers that had children with epilepsy

193
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,638
autism people that had cancer severe

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,759
neurological disorders and so we really

195
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,319
wanted to

196
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,080
provide them with the best information

197
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,319
the most practical information for them

198
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,758
to find efficacy using cannabis

199
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,080
medicines

200
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,160
and that's kind of how we

201
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,918
got here

202
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,360
when in the middle of our research

203
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,598
trying to search for answers for

204
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,038
patients my wife nicole was diagnosed

205
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:59,120
with stage four metastatic breast cancer

206
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,199
and automatically you know it was a

207
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,759
no-brainer to

208
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,240
use all of the uh knowledge that we had

209
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,919
gained to help her uh because we knew

210
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,840
that can cannabis could save her life

211
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,439
well

212
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:16,239
so i think so you're obviously kind of

213
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,560
in a unique position there um having

214
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
had experience with medical cannabis and

215
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,879
knowing that it could be

216
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
effective for your wife's diagnosis how

217
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,479
did you first tackle that how did you

218
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,598
first apply the knowledge that you had

219
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:33,679
gained in the industry to helping her

220
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:36,158
so we we knew that uh even though it's a

221
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,199
pretty nascent science uh the

222
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,360
understanding the concept of cannabis

223
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,839
turning off a cancer cell

224
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
we understood enough to try to pursue

225
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,920
this um

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,720
you know there's no clear reference as

227
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,120
to what type of cannabis uh strain will

228
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,480
res positively response uh respond

229
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
against a

230
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,278
cancer cell line

231
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,159
so

232
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:03,120
we did our research um

233
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,120
you know we we placed it up to god and

234
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
and we gave it a chance and we had

235
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,799
excellent results as a result we were

236
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,759
privileged to

237
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,479
enjoy those results because we know that

238
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,399
for a lot of people that this uh

239
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,278
is not an option simply because they

240
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,679
don't have access to it

241
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,679
yeah and you know we always talk about

242
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,599
how there's sort of a number of

243
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,278
different variables here

244
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,800
in order to kind of find an effective

245
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,720
treatment right because first there's a

246
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,079
number of different types of cancer you

247
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
know you know cancer's sort of an

248
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
umbrella term that describes a lot of

249
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,440
different conditions and then of course

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,399
on the medicine side on the on the

251
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,200
strain side there's a lot of different

252
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,120
chemical profiles in these strains that

253
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,399
are all kind of grouped under cannabis

254
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,560
so

255
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,958
how did you go about you know

256
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,039
identifying which strains might be

257
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,879
effective for your particular case or

258
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,039
your wife's particular case

259
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,879
sure so we you know we were very

260
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,879
fortunate to have

261
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,159
uh people that were very knowledgeable

262
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,559
about

263
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:08,480
this subject around us um we have

264
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,078
uh we've been very privileged to have

265
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,920
the guidance

266
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,159
of practitioners that have a lot of

267
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,159
experience with this and

268
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,000
you know at the end of at the end of it

269
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,078
we had to make an educated guess to

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,399
figure out what to use for nicole

271
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,838
specifically because of all the all the

272
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,958
factors that you mentioned that are

273
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,079
involved

274
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,838
you know

275
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,199
i think that

276
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
as we go

277
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,839
uh further in exploring this topic we're

278
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,559
going to find out that there's a lot of

279
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,480
specificity between

280
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,639
you know the patient's genotype

281
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,839
the plant's genotype the chemotype

282
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,519
expression

283
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,600
how to bridge the gap between all those

284
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,159
three parameters right it almost seems

285
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
like it's individualized medicine uh

286
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,639
that we need to

287
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,360
adopt to figure this out

288
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,399
and so you know for us uh

289
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,800
it was it was just a matter of um doing

290
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,360
our homework um

291
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,399
we would focus on strains that have

292
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,959
really white profiles of um

293
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,440
minor cannabinoid groups

294
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,199
and uh you know

295
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,640
our strains are proprietary but i'll

296
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,920
tell you this um

297
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,240
there are strains that are closely

298
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,519
related to their wild ancestors if that

299
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,519
makes any sense

300
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,679
sure sure

301
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,679
so

302
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,560
you mentioned that you were fortunate to

303
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,559
have access to a lot of great doctors

304
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:36,078
who had you know experience using

305
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,919
medical cannabis um

306
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,759
what was your experience working with

307
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,599
other doctors who maybe weren't in the

308
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,799
cannabis space but you were you know in

309
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,399
the course of treatment telling them

310
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,319
that you were going to use cannabis what

311
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,278
was their reaction were they supportive

312
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,839
were they knowledgeable um

313
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,360
yeah that's that's a great question ben

314
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,160
it's actually

315
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,278
uh prompted us to take on our mission

316
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,480
really

317
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,879
because

318
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,278
we still have a medical system that

319
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,958
looks at cannabis regular cannabis use

320
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,159
as a cannabis substance use disorder

321
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,719
the idea

322
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,600
for physicians at large

323
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,000
to

324
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,320
use uh cannabis therapy

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,240
um on a consistent basis

326
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,240
we're still a long way to figuring that

327
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,959
out in the clinics we're still a long

328
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
wait for for doctors to adopt that

329
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,479
and from our personal experience i can

330
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,000
tell you that when we were trying to

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,039
look for uh the best cancer uh care for

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,559
nicole

333
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,159
you know we were living in southern

334
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,278
california at the time

335
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,120
we moved uh to the new york tri-state

336
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,439
area specifically to look for the best

337
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,959
cancer clinic that we could possibly

338
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,760
source for nicole

339
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:48,239
we had the opportunity of having an

340
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,000
oncologist that was a world-renowned

341
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
drug discovery

342
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,839
researcher very well versed in targeted

343
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,679
therapies

344
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,600
we exposed

345
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,120
the science to the doctor we explained

346
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,519
that we were using

347
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,919
cannabis in the context of trying to

348
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,919
find a solution for cancer

349
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,559
and you know even though she saw the

350
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,360
results she saw the scans with her own

351
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,119
eyes she couldn't explain the results

352
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,800
at the end of the day

353
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,480
you know she told us well you know

354
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,078
you're part of the

355
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,200
very few

356
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,278
and very lucky people that get a diagno

357
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
a result like this but i don't know

358
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,519
anything about the science so we still

359
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
have an old guard

360
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,320
in the

361
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,479
in the medical science community that's

362
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,560
still holding strong

363
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,519
and i really believe that it's because

364
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,078
of the stigma that cannabis um has tied

365
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,360
to it you know it even though this is

366
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,799
thoroughly researched in pre-clinical um

367
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,800
essays

368
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,679
we still have a medical community that

369
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,120
is unwilling to look at this

370
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,879
because they have their preconceived

371
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,839
notions about cannabis

372
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,039
yeah

373
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
how much of that do you think comes down

374
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,078
to like a lack of training as well

375
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,519
because i know that you know healthcare

376
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,120
professionals they're not learning about

377
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,320
the end of cannabinoid system in their

378
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,078
training correct that's that's uh that's

379
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
one of the big reasons

380
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,919
so we don't we don't have proper

381
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
training for

382
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,639
medical professionals to understand this

383
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,879
uh very complex system in our physiology

384
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,440
in fact you know we've we've done a lot

385
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,039
of advocacy and a lot of uh trying to

386
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,320
raise awareness for the benefit of

387
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,240
patients to

388
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,879
to have a an open relationship with

389
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,680
their physician about the use

390
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,519
and you know it's not um

391
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,239
it's not something that they can even

392
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,919
wrap their head around uh some doctors

393
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,120
believe that

394
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,198
you know

395
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,600
the endocannabinoid system or are

396
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,319
nowadays how we um

397
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,440
how we know it as the an endocannabinoid

398
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
dome

399
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,360
uh

400
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,079
is

401
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,399
is is too good to be true for them

402
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:58,319
in short and so

403
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,399
to understand such a complex system of

404
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,600
ligands and receptors

405
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,839
interacting and interacting compounds

406
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,920
cannabinoid mediators

407
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
you know all firing throughout our

408
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,000
system at the same time perfectly

409
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,479
choreographed to create a balance

410
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,480
throughout all of our physiology

411
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,879
it's a hard concept to bring across um

412
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,199
and so you know some universities are

413
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,399
adopting are looking at the science and

414
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,399
adopting courses to to educate uh people

415
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
that are willing to

416
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,559
to learn but it's still for the cannabis

417
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,079
enthusiast it's not part of a medical

418
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,119
curriculum yet

419
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,000
and so we need we need this to be

420
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,039
looked

421
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
as

422
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,078
a

423
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,519
as a viable uh clinical approach um

424
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,879
in medicine

425
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,799
that's the only way that we're gonna get

426
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,639
this into the clinics and this is a

427
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,359
reality that we have to grapple with if

428
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,799
we if we really wanna see this uh back

429
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,159
again in the u.s pharmacopoeia

430
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,319
yeah we agree 100 especially here on the

431
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,799
on the canmed side we're we're trying to

432
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,639
do our part we're partnering with uh our

433
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,039
good friends bonnie goldstein dustin

434
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,120
sulak kevin spellman and eloise thiessen

435
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,799
they're leading our one day medical

436
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
practicum where

437
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,958
we invite health care providers and

438
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,600
anyone who's interested to come and and

439
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,599
get sort of a one day

440
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,278
crash course master class whatever you

441
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,000
want to call it from you know some of

442
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,679
the real titans in the industry so

443
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,320
if there's any healthcare providers out

444
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,159
there who feel like they need they need

445
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,839
a primer on the endocannabinoid system

446
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,439
and all the things that cannabis can do

447
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,199
in the clinical setting please

448
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
definitely check that out

449
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,879
yeah that's that's a wonderful

450
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,000
opportunity that you guys offer because

451
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,240
you have

452
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,078
some of the most brilliant minds uh

453
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,600
giving instruction on this topic which

454
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:52,479
is you know it's a rare thing

455
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,240
yeah and like you said when you were

456
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,839
sort of early in your cannabis journey

457
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,720
when you were on the side of you know

458
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:02,079
being a medicine provider you you saw

459
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,000
firsthand that how many people

460
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,159
are lacking guidance for lack of a

461
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
better term and you know they know that

462
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,319
cannabis can be helpful for their

463
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,599
condition but they just don't know where

464
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,199
to turn

465
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,759
um so

466
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,240
i think we as a as a cannabis community

467
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,720
really need to do our part to help

468
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,558
educate those providers so that they can

469
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,038
so they can help their patients

470
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,240
right now that's such an important part

471
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,759
and um

472
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,079
you know bridging that gap of

473
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,798
you know giving enough information for

474
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,639
physicians to confidently prescribe this

475
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,480
to patients

476
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,160
we need to do a lot of work with it we

477
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,319
need to do a lot of work with it and you

478
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
know

479
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:48,239
the cannabis education plays a big role

480
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,960
having consistent and reliable supplies

481
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,558
of pharmaceutical grade botanical uh

482
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,038
drug preparations

483
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,519
you know it sounds like uh

484
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,679
letters there but

485
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,918
the the viability of having these

486
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,640
available in dispensaries we're still a

487
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,799
long way of uh from from having these

488
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,160
available to people um

489
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,160
at dispensaries you know they focus on

490
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
creating a cpg product that's going to

491
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,600
be good for the consumer that's going to

492
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,839
be that's going to sell

493
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,678
they're not looking at

494
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,519
you know consistent reproducible

495
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,960
reproducibility with chemotype

496
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,319
expression

497
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,319
so that

498
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,639
if a person that

499
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,038
uses this and is able to correct

500
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,960
symptoms of chronic disease they can go

501
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,119
back and source the same product over

502
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,400
and over we still have are a long way

503
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,319
from from

504
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,840
uh having access to that type of

505
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,240
formulation

506
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,558
and so we lived through that throughout

507
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,880
our own experience with nicole

508
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,119
i really want to just uh

509
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
emphasize this because we were very

510
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,000
lucky

511
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,839
to be in an industry uh to be

512
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,880
established in an industry to already

513
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:58,079
know

514
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,880
uh how to produce these formulations

515
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,960
and just to give you an example of all

516
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,200
the infrastructure that we had to build

517
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,880
all the know-how that we had to uh

518
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,160
create

519
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
all the parameters that we had to

520
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,759
consider

521
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,400
you know we had to

522
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,759
first we had to source the strains that

523
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,679
we thought were going to produce the

524
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,319
anti-cancer effect

525
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,160
we had to convince seed banks to share

526
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,918
their genetics with us

527
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,919
we had to source uh cultivators that had

528
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,759
the capabilities of growing these plants

529
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,000
in controlled environment

530
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,839
and that were willing to set aside a

531
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,119
production

532
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,399
space to exclusively grow these strains

533
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,079
for us

534
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,320
we had to learn sophisticated methods of

535
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,720
of extraction so that we made sure to

536
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,240
extract all the therapeutic compounds uh

537
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,720
from the flower

538
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,359
and while still maintaining uh

539
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,960
chemical integrity of the um

540
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,479
cannabinoid groups we really believe

541
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,240
that the acid cannabinoid groups have a

542
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,880
lot of potential

543
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,519
and you know to tie all this together we

544
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,120
had to figure out um

545
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,158
quality testing

546
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:11,038
to to really make sure that we were

547
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,559
getting the same chemo type expression

548
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,038
to make sure that the quality of the

549
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,720
product was always the same for nicole

550
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,200
and of course the clinical guidance

551
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,960
right you know how do you start off with

552
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,440
a particular dosage with a starting

553
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,759
dosage how do how do you titrate slowly

554
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,640
to avoid side effects and then how do

555
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:31,279
you make um such a

556
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,120
a robust cannabis regimen functional for

557
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,839
a person you know that those are the

558
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:39,038
those are the very critical points

559
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,959
that most patients do not have access to

560
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,919
you know right most people are not going

561
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,720
to build a lab to you know

562
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,440
uh

563
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,798
get consistent uh supply of cannabis

564
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,400
flowers to produce their own cannabis

565
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,400
medicines and put together all this

566
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,559
infrastructure it's just not

567
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,400
it's not uh realistic

568
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,720
so this is why we have to make these

569
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,640
available for people

570
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,558
yeah no that's that's amazing that you

571
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,679
were able to to put all that together

572
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:08,399
literally from like not seed to sale but

573
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,360
you know we say that term as kind of

574
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,159
you know

575
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,079
to express the whole life cycle of a

576
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,280
product but you've certainly done that

577
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,079
um

578
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,480
so yeah you're right i think the average

579
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,319
the average patient the average consumer

580
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,919
certainly doesn't have the resources or

581
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,279
the know-how to put something together

582
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,480
like that so

583
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,480
so what do they do

584
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,480
well so you know it's uh

585
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:40,480
it's it's a sad thing that we don't have

586
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,400
this available for patients because

587
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,798
you know we see it all the time we see

588
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,798
it in the infusion rooms when we see

589
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:50,158
people that are going through the

590
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:53,200
harshest of of cancer treatments

591
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,280
and doctors don't have the the effective

592
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,558
tools to deal with those side effects

593
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,440
yet so

594
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,599
we have antibiotics we have anti-pain

595
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,840
medication we have anti-anxiety

596
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,759
medication at the end of the day

597
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,240
it may or may not work for a patient

598
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,359
some patients take it diligently and you

599
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,120
know they become numb to their situation

600
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,240
you know that's the reality of the

601
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,279
situation

602
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,839
cannabis does such a great job at

603
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,158
getting rid of those um

604
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,000
those side effects and

605
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,159
doctors know this

606
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
you know we've we've known this since

607
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,600
the 80s since the 70s we've we you know

608
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,279
under the table

609
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,959
doctors will recommend to their patients

610
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,399
hey well why don't you try cannabis you

611
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
know maybe it'll leave some of the pain

612
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,038
or whatever

613
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,798
but really don't they don't go beyond

614
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,400
that um

615
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,519
and so

616
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,440
there is the sad reality is that

617
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,879
patients that don't have a lot of

618
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,480
resources to

619
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,120
to figure this out

620
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,159
don't have the best reference to

621
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,519
to gain the knowledge to gain the access

622
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,039
they look towards their medical

623
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,480
professionals

624
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,359
and they're not willing to talk to them

625
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,519
about this you know we we have

626
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,599
very few doctors that

627
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,679
do recognize it most of them because

628
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,279
they have seen positive results with

629
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,480
their patients and they're turned on to

630
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,918
it and so

631
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,400
you know they make a little bit time

632
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,640
during their really busy schedule to

633
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,960
to research a little bit about it

634
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,960
but that's just a select few so we

635
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,679
really need to raise awareness

636
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,159
so that we can give people uh

637
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,480
the knowledge and resources to figure

638
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,240
this out

639
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,798
yeah and that's a great point too um so

640
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,120
how primarily was nicole using medical

641
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,558
cannabis was it to sort of alleviate

642
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,399
some of the side effects of the other

643
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,319
treatments that she was using or was it

644
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,798
specific was it actually you know

645
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,278
targeted to try to actually reduce tumor

646
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,679
growth or or anything like that

647
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:55,119
yeah it was it was specifically so we

648
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,919
knew that um we we could try to use

649
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,678
cannabis to turn off um

650
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,440
cancer cells so

651
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,798
that was the end goal

652
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,278
uh to get to that point we had to

653
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,879
you know we had to slowly introduce her

654
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,960
to cannabis she

655
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,640
in nicole's particular situation she was

656
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,038
very sensitive to the effect of thc

657
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,799
so when you have a patient that's highly

658
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,278
susceptible to

659
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,119
to the psychoactive effect of cannabis

660
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,278
you have to move very carefully and very

661
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,519
slowly to titrate that

662
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,278
dosage up to the levels that we thought

663
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,240
were going to create an impact against

664
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:34,558
the cancer and usually these are levels

665
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,679
that surpass you know

666
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,440
400 milligrams of thc on a daily basis

667
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,919
or you know

668
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,038
the same amount and and the acid can

669
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,360
have in a group uh you know maybe

670
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:50,158
a thousand milligrams of cbda daily so

671
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,240
these are really high dosages to

672
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,159
uh to get a patient on

673
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,640
if you don't know what you're doing

674
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,880
you can really put off the patient with

675
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,759
a bad experience

676
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,840
so

677
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,240
we had to make sure that the strains

678
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,399
that we really understood the

679
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,200
therapeutic effect of the strains

680
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,159
whether it was a mood enhancement

681
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,480
profile or a mood depressing

682
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,760
profile that would create someone's for

683
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,599
example

684
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,879
uh we had to figure out how to

685
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,519
appropriately

686
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,799
dose each formulation throughout the day

687
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,119
so that we could

688
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:28,359
create this as a functional experience

689
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,359
for nicole

690
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,678
so i wonder if you could speak

691
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,319
specifically about the presentation that

692
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,919
you're going to be giving at canmed give

693
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,678
the listeners a little preview of what

694
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,559
they can expect there

695
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,519
sure so we we're gonna all the science

696
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:49,200
that we have uh research that we have

697
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,798
collected to figure out this this um

698
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,558
this project

699
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,839
uh we're gonna explain during our

700
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,079
presentation i'm gonna give an overview

701
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,240
of all the identified

702
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,240
mechanisms through which

703
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,839
cannabis can turn off a cancer cell or

704
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,679
create that programmed cell death

705
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,319
apoptosis

706
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,000
i'm also going to explain how we used

707
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,000
cannabis in combination with

708
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,759
psychedelics

709
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,079
we use psychedelics to create to

710
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:20,798
ameliorate

711
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,720
the depression that's really tight

712
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:23,759
to the side effect of standard cancer

713
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,919
therapies

714
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:30,000
and the prognosis of having a terminally

715
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,759
terminal a terminal disease because

716
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,599
metastatic breast cancer ism is a

717
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,720
terminal disease

718
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,719
we

719
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,278
where i'm going to explain how

720
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,759
psilocybin in particular has anti

721
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:45,599
possible anti-cancer mechanisms just

722
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,599
like uh cannabis and in fact

723
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,520
cannabis and psilocybin uh signaling

724
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,719
pathways to turn off a cancer cell

725
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,960
interlap

726
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,400
uh ironically so i'm gonna i'm gonna

727
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,679
speak about that

728
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,679
and then i'm gonna talk about uh

729
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,080
nicole's case study that is going

730
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,120
through peer review uh publication right

731
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,879
now

732
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,319
what we're doing is a result of our

733
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,679
experience

734
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,798
you know we have all this wonderful

735
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
knowledge

736
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,798
we've already uh solved this issue in

737
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,319
our minds right it's a no-brainer

738
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,240
cannabis needs to be in the clinic but

739
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,599
how are we going to do that that's

740
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,440
that's the biggest question so

741
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,599
you know i'll explain more of the

742
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,919
science aspect i really wanted to hone

743
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,558
in today and explain

744
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,038
the social issues that that are around

745
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,639
this and and how that needs to be

746
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,720
addressed so that we can get this into

747
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,080
the clinics

748
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,600
yeah absolutely and one of the things

749
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,439
that you mentioned is research right

750
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,278
that's one of the barriers to really

751
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,640
getting acceptance

752
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,720
from you know the greater medical

753
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,559
community or even you know

754
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,558
the society at large right everyone

755
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,599
wants to see more data but

756
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,398
the problem with that it's a bit of a

757
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,558
chicken in the egg situation right until

758
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,079
we can have you know

759
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,038
the legal

760
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,960
um

761
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,798
the legal framework opens up to allow

762
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,600
for more research we can't really

763
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:07,119
generate that data but you know so

764
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,079
we're in sort of this

765
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,759
this tough limbo right now and luckily

766
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,918
we have folks like you and the other

767
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,759
presenters at canmed who are are doing

768
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,480
the best with the limited resources and

769
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,319
support that they have to um

770
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,278
to try to get us there

771
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:26,319
yeah it you know it's it becomes a very

772
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,240
complex project because

773
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,558
taking cannabis

774
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,120
eventually what we want to do is provide

775
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,200
this for everybody and the only way that

776
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,759
we've identified that the medical

777
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,840
community can fully embrace this

778
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,599
is if we take cannabis

779
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,639
formulations against

780
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:48,079
cancer through the drug approval process

781
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,640
and that's a that's a big to do um

782
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:54,798
you know the infrastructure to to do

783
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,960
that is just barely being uh written

784
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:00,158
right now you know you have

785
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,558
fda coming up with task forces that

786
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,880
are evaluating projects like this on an

787
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:07,278
on an individual basis because the the

788
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,559
rules have not been well defined

789
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,480
and so

790
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,639
cannabis has a lot of nuances that

791
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,919
regular pharmaceuticals don't have to

792
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,799
deal with

793
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,600
there's a lot of heterogeneity and

794
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,278
the

795
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,678
compounds that

796
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,119
cannabis plant produces we're producing

797
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,720
from whole plant

798
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,959
formulations

799
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,159
so there's a lot of critical points to

800
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,480
make sure that you have sustainably

801
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,039
reproducible formulations

802
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,319
that can go through the rigor of of fda

803
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,519
approval

804
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,918
um

805
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,278
we we've really taken this on as our

806
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,399
mission

807
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:43,679
and so

808
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,839
we

809
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,880
as a result of that

810
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,599
we have committed to building a team

811
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,240
that is uh knowledgeable enough that it

812
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,879
has enough resources to actually take

813
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,120
this through the drug approval process

814
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,520
and so in order to do that we had to

815
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,879
partner up with some of the best

816
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,200
academic

817
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,120
clinical research institutions

818
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,038
some of the best science

819
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,599
research institutions in the united

820
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,440
states and in the uk

821
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:16,719
and you know

822
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,679
with a project like this you have to

823
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,798
you have to account for things like

824
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,640
stabilization of your cannabis genetics

825
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,759
you know uh

826
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,600
sustainably propagating your your plants

827
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,359
which probably isn't some sort of envy

828
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,079
true propagation

829
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,558
uh you have to have control uh

830
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,839
environment cultivation you have to have

831
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:42,079
the most rigorous uh screening methods

832
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,599
like a mass spectrometry analysis to

833
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,839
verify

834
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:49,678
that you are producing all the

835
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:51,359
chemotypes and all of your profiles

836
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,759
you need to have capabilities to

837
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,359
identify unknown cannabinoids uh because

838
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,000
we still don't know

839
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,918
100 of the content uh of for the

840
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,839
therapeutic compounds that come from a

841
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,440
particular cannabis strain

842
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,398
and so it's it's it's a complex process

843
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,038
that

844
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,119
traditional uh pharmaceutical

845
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:15,038
biopharmaceutical companies are really

846
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:18,239
not used to uh there is no president to

847
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:20,319
for this type of pipeline yet so we're

848
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,839
we're hoping to shed light on this and

849
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,839
really um you know be successful in in

850
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,439
our journey

851
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,199
yeah no you're right quite the

852
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,120
undertaking and

853
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,080
i know on a previous podcast i spoke

854
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,000
with daddy mary who's out in israel and

855
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,439
who's doing a lot of research

856
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,720
specifically on on cancer in treating

857
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,480
with cannabinoids and you mentioned that

858
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,558
you need the capability to identify

859
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,399
those minor cannabinoids and if i

860
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,519
remember correctly from my discussion

861
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,678
with him

862
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,599
some of the effective cannabinoids for

863
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,278
treating a particular type of cancer

864
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,678
that he was talking about they were

865
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:59,200
unnamed cannabinoids that you know

866
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,720
weren't even

867
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,159
really in the literature aren't

868
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,640
something that your average cannabis

869
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,159
testing lab is is looking for so

870
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,000
yeah i would imagine that your

871
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,440
capabilities on that side would need to

872
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,038
be pretty um

873
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,200
pretty impressive

874
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,960
that's correct ben you know luckily we

875
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,720
have the right people in every corner to

876
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,480
pull this together

877
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,278
uh we've partnered up with imperial

878
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,360
college of london uh they've agreed to

879
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,278
undertake our in vitro and in vivo

880
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,719
studies on eight of the cannabis

881
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,919
extracts that

882
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,159
we've successfully reproduced um at this

883
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,679
point and we we have now tracked uh

884
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,039
clinically

885
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,320
uh we've partnered up with the

886
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,319
university of connecticut

887
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,000
with

888
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,398
their organic chemistry department uh

889
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,960
molecular biology department

890
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,798
first to figure out um

891
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,038
how to reproduce the chemotype that

892
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:57,440
we're looking for in the plant

893
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:59,278
and then uh how to how to um screen for

894
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,120
these unknown compounds that you're that

895
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,278
you're mentioning we

896
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,879
we still are a long way

897
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,240
from knowing

898
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,880
a hundred percent

899
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,599
of these compounds and what they do we

900
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,919
haven't uh isolated most cannabinoids we

901
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:18,158
don't even know what they look like so

902
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,240
you know it's it is uh it's it's only

903
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,080
this is a project for only the most

904
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,399
seasoned um

905
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:28,079
scientists to participate in because

906
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:31,518
it's a a it's a discovery all throughout

907
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:33,439
uh the journey we don't we may

908
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,359
find out about things that we didn't

909
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,080
even think about it along this journey

910
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,798
but the commitment to to bringing these

911
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,720
uh medications to people is there

912
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,240
and we believe that we have a good shot

913
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,558
at this

914
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,440
yeah you're right and

915
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,839
you know i think that your story is very

916
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,200
um emblematic of what we're we're

917
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:54,959
talking about here in cammon because it

918
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,960
takes a village right you know you need

919
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,000
to work with the cultivators you need to

920
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,558
work with

921
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,919
the scientists the clinicians the

922
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:06,558
laboratory professionals um to really uh

923
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,280
make this thing happen so again that's

924
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,599
what we try to do in canmed is to bring

925
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,679
people from all the different

926
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,919
areas of the industry together so we can

927
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,760
kind of push this whole thing forward so

928
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,878
um i think that's a great it's a great

929
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,720
tie-in

930
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:21,838
oh yeah and i'll mention this ben you

931
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,559
know

932
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,799
as a cannabis uh community that's

933
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,838
focused on on research

934
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,519
sometimes we're we we clutch onto the

935
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,799
proprietary information that we have

936
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:35,838
right and we don't want to give you

937
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,079
but you know

938
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:42,719
if we just came together

939
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,879
and not placed our our projects um as

940
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,358
valuable but place the the patient

941
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,440
really as the valuable

942
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,039
as a valuable person here

943
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,878
you know if we could come together and

944
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,440
share the knowledge that we have we

945
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,920
could get there much easily and much

946
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,920
quicker than than the trend that we are

947
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,240
in right now

948
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,200
yeah i agree with that 100

949
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:07,759
um great place to stop but before i let

950
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,439
you go um i want to give you a chance to

951
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,800
share with the audience
