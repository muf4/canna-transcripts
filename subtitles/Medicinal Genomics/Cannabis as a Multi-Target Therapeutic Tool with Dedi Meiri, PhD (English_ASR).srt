KMED25. Our guest today is Dr. Daddy

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,120
Meri. Daddy is the associate professor

62
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,679
at the Techneon Institute where he heads

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,080
the laboratory of cancer biology and

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
canabonoid research. His lab

65
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,080
investigates the vast therapeutic

66
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,719
potential of secondary metabolites from

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,360
cannabis and other herbs, algae, and

68
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,439
psychedelic mushrooms and reveals how

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
these naturally occurring metabolites

70
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,919
affect various types of cancer,

71
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,719
inflammatory disease, and disorders of

72
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,280
the nervous system. Daddy is also highly

73
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,680
involved in governmental regulations and

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,919
is a residing member in several Israeli

75
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,319
Ministry of Health committees that seek

76
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,479
to advance the fundamental understanding

77
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,359
of optimal cannabis and other

78
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,119
psychedelic plants usage and curtailing

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,680
adverse effects. During our

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,759
conversation, we discuss the wide range

81
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,879
of clinical applications for cannabis

82
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,519
medicine, including cancer, epilepsy,

83
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,479
sleep disorders, Alzheimer's, and

84
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,920
women's health issues like

85
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,079
endometriosis. How cannabis's entourage

86
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,119
effect challenges the traditional one

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,640
drug, one target

88
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,879
model. The fact that many powerful

89
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,279
canabonoids are often overlooked by

90
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,959
standard lab testing methods, even

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
though they exist in significant

92
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,519
quantities. and show therapeutic

93
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,560
potential. Israel's medical cannabis

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,680
model, which treats cannabis like a

95
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,759
pharmaceutical with prescriptions,

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,080
clinical oversight, and growing

97
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,638
physician

98
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,840
acceptance. Dedi's goal to provide

99
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,319
evidence-based, accurate treatments that

100
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,279
tailor cannabis therapies to specific

101
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,839
health conditions and individual needs,

102
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,599
and more. Before we get to my

103
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,638
conversation with Daddy, I'd like to

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,080

121
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,439
Good afternoon, Daddy. Thank you so much

122
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,039
for joining me on the podcast.

123
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,519
Thank you for having me. It's always a

124
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,959
pleasure. Yes, it's always great to talk

125
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,879
with you. You're one of our favorite

126
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,038
guests. You're one of our favorite CAM

127
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,918
Med presenters, and we're thrilled to

128
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,918
have you back for CAM

129
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:45,038
Med. Uh the title of your presentation

130
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:48,159
this year is Cannabis as a therapy

131
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:51,360
across diverse cancer types, milestones

132
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,280
and insights from a decade of research.

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,800
So, first of all, congratulations on

134
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,839
that milestone, a decade of research.

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,400
That's that's makes me not younger and

136
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,038
not young anymore anymore. You know, I

137
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,159
was young and promised. I I left with

138
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,839
the promise. Yep. Well, we'll never be

139
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,400
this young again, right? We're always

140
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,399
we're all getting older.

141
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,560
So, it's all about your lab's work

142
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,959
investigating whether cannabis can serve

143
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,280
as a primary pharmaceutical treatment

144
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,519
for cancer. But before we really dive

145
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,079
into that, um I I am interested in kind

146
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,159
of exploring this past decade. How has

147
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,839
perception of of cannabis and medical

148
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,840
research evolved since you got started?

149
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:38,318
So I think it's a it's an amazing

150
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:40,799
journey and I started very skeptical.

151
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,360
you know cannabis like everybody that

152
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,918
started and I think you know people said

153
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,520
that cannabis is not addicted try to do

154
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,120
a research with cannabis you will learn

155
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:54,159
that it's very addicted

156
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,160
and it's phenomenal the results that you

157
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,800
get working with cannabis it's something

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,520
that a scientist usually don't see in

159
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:08,160
the lab in many indication

160
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:11,680
so I think it it's quite a journey and I

161
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,720
would never dream to have such a result

162
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,240
so phenomenal in so many illnesses

163
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,840
different you know usually scientists

164
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,400
it's somebody that know everything about

165
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:26,399
nothing you know we're going very deep

166
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:29,719
but cannabis caused my lab to be open

167
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,679
and and to work in such a variety

168
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,880
indication epilepsy Alzheimer's sleep

169
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,240
disorder and multiple sclerosis

170
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:42,000
inflammation cancers different types of

171
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,360
cancers. So cannabis is touching so many

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,800
systems in our body and every time we

173
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:52,400
discover something new very exciting and

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,478
it's taking the lab or part of of my

175
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:59,598
students to a new area which is just

176
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:04,120
phenomenal. It's I'm feeling I'm feeling

177
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:06,478
so lucky that I choose to work with

178
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,720
cannabis. First of all, I think we are

179
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:14,000
helping a lot of patient. It's a very

180
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:19,840
good feeling. Second, it's create my lab

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,038
to be so you know diverse and and so

182
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:25,758
interesting for me which is you know I'm

183
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,918
I'm grateful for that. Can it be

184
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,360
difficult to focus though if you have so

185
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,079
many different indications that you're

186
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,759
investigating? Oh, this is the criticism

187
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
that I'm getting in the academia and

188
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,479
this is the criticism I'm sometimes on

189
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,958
myself. You can't be expert for

190
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,278
everything. So maybe I'm expert for

191
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,439
cannabis or the endocanabinoid system

192
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,159
which you know I'm working with other

193
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,760
plants also but

194
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:54,079
I I will never be the best scientist at

195
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,720
doing epilepsy or the best science at

196
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,519
doing multiple sclerosis or sleep

197
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,560
disorder but I'm usually collaborating

198
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,759
with expert I'm bringing the the

199
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,319
knowledge on the cannabis the

200
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,958
endocanabinoid system and whatever and

201
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,480
and collaborating with expert in the

202
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,239
field and then you

203
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,600
know jumping on their back and then

204
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,440
riding with them.

205
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:25,519
So again it's it's it's in personality

206
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,080
issues you know I enjoying this diverse

207
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,399
I

208
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,800
was as when I did my post and I want

209
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,919
work on one protein in one

210
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,919
phosphorulation in one area you know I

211
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,759
could commit suicide it's not for me I

212
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,519
need to look on the big picture to see

213
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:45,200
the big picture it's more interesting

214
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,278
for me and I cannabis was

215
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,839
I was lucky to touch it because of this

216
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:53,439
diversity. Yes, there is a penalty about

217
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,959
how deep you going in each indication.

218
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,360
Is there a favorite though? Is there an

219
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,199
indication that's uh top of the list for

220
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,759
you?

221
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,680
Sleep. We we were talking about that

222
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,360
earlier. I'm not sleeping much. I don't

223
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,239
have a sleep problem, but I think it's

224
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,720
sleep. It's extremely important. And

225
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,120
cancer. You know, I'm my laboratory is

226
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,320
lab for cancer research. I'm coming from

227
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,440
them. But

228
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:24,000
also I I I think cannabis can be a

229
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:28,120
promise or or can be a treatment to some

230
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,559
types of cancers and and I

231
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,799
think it's nice to find cannabis is

232
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,239
helping in sleep and whatever but when

233
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:40,240
you succeeding to eliminate tumors and

234
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,399
things like that it's it's a different

235
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,519
level of science and and and feeling

236
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,000
about you know what you're doing. I will

237
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,320
say another things in the last three

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,440
years the lab is working around women

239
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,399
health and and endometriosis. It started

240
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,320
for breast cancer but move for

241
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,240
endometriosis and the results there is

242
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,120
are

243
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:08,560
phenomenal and very interesting the

244
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,240
field is very interesting you know I

245
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,159
don't want to say that women are very

246
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,959
interesting for me but in general I

247
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,480
think the field the

248
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:21,599
hormone you know all all

249
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,000
these system is in the last years are

250
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,159
very exciting for me yeah that seems to

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
be an emerging topic. I know that we did

252
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,719
have a presentation about it. I believe

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,559
it was last year about

254
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,079
endometriosis and we have another one

255
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,000
this year. If it's not a presentation,

256
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:39,359
it's definitely a poster presentation.

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,679
Um, so yeah, those those women health

258
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,759
topics are definitely gaining more

259
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:47,439
traction. At least we're seeing it.

260
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,319
Yeah, it's very different. It's working

261
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,480
in a very different mechanism that the

262
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,519
endocan the regular endocanabonoid and

263
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,159
CB2 and CB-1 and that and again as a

264
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:03,039
scientist it's fascinating me and and

265
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:05,600
it's open new gates to new you know new

266
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,480
windows

267
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,360
so it's interesting but you know I can

268
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,079
talk now 10 hours on on the new

269
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,240
indication and findings that we found in

270
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:21,919
the last year or two I I think what we

271
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,680
calling the entourage effect okay

272
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:29,360
is something that I'm putting a focus on

273
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:31,120
him on it but not in as a classic what

274
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,680
we called in the conference entourage

275
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,959
effect but as a

276
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,399
concept that what we call

277
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:41,759
polypharmacology that few compounds

278
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,240
using few compounds as or or you know

279
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,519
combination of treatments in order to

280
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,639
attack a disease And cannabis is coming

281
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,639
within like the the the because the

282
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,320
endocanabon system is so wide and

283
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:59,879
cannabis have so many active compounds

284
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,120
it's bringing it within but as a concept

285
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,320
for medicine in general but plant

286
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,440
medicine in in

287
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:13,600
particular I think I'm I'm fascinating

288
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,399
and I'm you know trying to hold the flag

289
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,720
and and wave with

290
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:21,519
that to say that if we will understand

291
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,320
the complexity that plants bringing with

292
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,519
with them and and treating with this

293
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,480
complexity we might

294
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:32,879
solve diseases that for hundred of years

295
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,440
we are hitting our head to the wall like

296
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:39,838
Alzheimer ALS cancers that a single

297
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,600
molecule like pharma that trying to

298
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,760
attack with single molecule is not

299
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,278
working but if you coming with three

300
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,879
four molecules So that each one of them

301
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,439
affect different system, different

302
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,200
mechanism, whatever. You might achieve

303
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:58,199
something that is is is bigger and

304
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:01,440
cannabis is presenting that it's easy

305
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:04,319
to to show that with the cannabis, but

306
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,560
it's a it's a whole concept for herbal

307
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,480
medicine in general. You know, I have a

308
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,838
pitch that I'm saying in the last three

309
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,879
years. So if you already heard that, I'm

310
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,440
sorry for that.

311
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:20,360
Um people use plants as a medicine for

312
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,040
thousands of years. In the last 100

313
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,600
years, every time that we succeed to

314
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,599
isolate a molecule, we did kind of

315
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,040
modification whatever and it's become a

316
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,519
medicine. But every time that it was

317
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,679
more complicated, it was few compounds

318
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,399
or we didn't succeed to isolate. It

319
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,719
stayed as a herbal medicine and and

320
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,480
there is a gap

321
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,920
between accurate medicine that we know

322
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,839
exactly the molecule safety dosing and

323
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,240
herbal medicine doesn't matter if it's

324
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,320
cannabis or are there herbal medicine

325
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,919
you know ginsan or whatever you said

326
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,760
take you don't know what is the active

327
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,479
compound you don't know do nosing maybe

328
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,198
it will help maybe not we have the

329
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,600
ability today with analytical and and

330
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,198
computers to understand this complexity

331
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,639
it's quite easy

332
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:10,479
Okay. And I think this

333
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:12,399
complexity can solve diseases and and

334
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,639
problems that we didn't succeed to solve

335
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,600
this till today. And I use cannabis give

336
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:24,360
me the tools to understand that and to

337
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:27,680
open you know a a new with herbal

338
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,560
medicine. Cannabis is a a perfect

339
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,039
example for this complexity. So I'm

340
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,879
using that and and this is exciting me

341
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:39,399
bigger than the cannabis bigger than the

342
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:41,919
field as as something con new

343
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,120
concept in in research and in medicine.

344
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:47,838
So this is something that I'm showing

345
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,639
with the cannabis in the last years you

346
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,639
know I'm taking a disease like

347
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,278
inflammatory bald disease like chron and

348
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,759
colitis and showing that few molecules

349
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,320
from the cannabis blocking the colon

350
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,240
cells to call the immune cells and few

351
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,000
other molecules affecting the immune

352
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,079
cells and few other cell compounds

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,519
affecting the third cells and all

354
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:14,958
together you get complex action that

355
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,839
treating the the the the chrono colitis

356
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,078
better than one molecule. So I'm using

357
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,279
the cannabis to prove kind of a bigger

358
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:26,559
concept and I'm very excited about that.

359
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,838
Sorry for very long answer. No, that's

360
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,000
interesting though. So you're basically

361
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,440
saying that the whole idea of single

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,039
single molecule single indication is a

363
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,639
bit of a fool's errand or it's

364
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,240
restrictive or that you're sort of

365
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,639
missing out on it's it's restrictive.

366
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,600
It's working sometimes but right there

367
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,839
is a limit and and and you know when I

368
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,399
started work with cannabis few years ago

369
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,120
10 years ago actually it was already 10

370
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,320
years ago and I realized there is many

371
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,879
compounds for for many indication I came

372
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,320
to one of the people you know I'm I'm a

373
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,120
professor in the technon it's kind of

374
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,199
the MIT of

375
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,359
of you know the US it's the technology

376
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,519
institute and we have few genius there

377
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,918
you know that you know finish high

378
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,759
school when they've been 11 and got a

379
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,600
lab when they're 15 these kind of

380
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,599
people. So I went to one of them and

381
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,918
said hey look I need your help you are

382
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,719
computer science bioinformatics and

383
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,038
everything look there are 100 compounds

384
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,360
and many indication he looked at me and

385
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,759
said I will teach you Excel you know

386
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,839
like this is not complex

387
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:34,919
okay you know the complexity that we can

388
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:37,798
understand today with computer AI

389
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,320
bionformatics proteomics metabolomics

390
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:41,798
whatever to understand how three

391
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,200
molecules working

392
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:48,400
together. It's it's a joke in the

393
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,360
abilities that we have today. But the

394
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,679
regulation is very or the physician, not

395
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,359
the physician, but mainly the

396
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,480
regulation, take the FDA as as an

397
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:01,599
example, is very still narrow. You know,

398
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,558
even though we can take a blood sample

399
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,558
today, run it on equipment, after 40

400
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:11,519
minutes, look on 5,000 different

401
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:14,160
molecules, still we need to use just one

402
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:18,319
because that's what we used to. Okay.

403
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:21,200
And I think it's we need to educate and

404
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:24,960
and to lead that and this is this is one

405
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,600
of scientist you know job to lead that

406
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,440
to to show that to present that to

407
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,839
explain that but I think we will see the

408
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,400
future of

409
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:39,678
medicines are more complicated drugs and

410
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:44,400
and plants in general and particularly

411
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,320
cannabis coming within it's in them this

412
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,919
complexity.

413
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,000
So that's interesting. So you started

414
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,640
off talking about how you're studying a

415
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,880
lot of different uh indications with

416
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,960
cannabis and how it's a combination. So

417
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,200
I'm curious when you're finding success

418
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
with treating these different

419
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,720
indications, is there ever an example

420
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,200
where it is a single molecule or is it

421
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,160
always a combination? No, no, there is

422
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,600
there is there is examples that we

423
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:16,360
found. I I gave this example. We found a

424
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:19,319
a new cannabonoids like new unknown

425
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:22,879
cannabis canabonoids we call it

426
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:25,599
3315 but it's a little bit similar to

427
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,520
CBG but with three oxygens. the the

428
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,959
structure is a little bit different

429
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:33,359
which these canabonoids

430
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,200
reduce the estrogen expression estrogen

431
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:40,199
receptor expression in in

432
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,919
in ovarian or breast or tube

433
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:47,840
cells which I don't familiar with any

434
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:51,038
other drug that reduce estrogen in

435
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,519
ovarian or tube cells and this can be a

436
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,640
a treatment for endometriosis and other

437
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,160
diseases and this is a signal

438
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,360
single molecules

439
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,000
but in most cases it it we found things

440
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,000
that are more complic.

441
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,839
Yeah. Yeah. So circling back to cancer

442
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,400
since that is going to be the topic of

443
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,480
your talk at KMA2

444
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,480
um and sort of talking about clinical

445
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,200
applications or maybe you know future

446
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,759
research. Has any of your findings led

447
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,038
to any clinical trials or real world

448
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:32,079
applications yet?

449
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:34,158
So yes and and both both questions are

450
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,720
the answer is yes. It's lead to clinical

451
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,760
trials and it lead to real world

452
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,279
applications. So in three cases first of

453
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:46,558
all I want to take one step back okay

454
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:49,240
and to explain cannabis is a given name

455
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,759
to hundred or thousands of different

456
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,759
chemovs each one of them contain

457
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,400
different combination of molecules and

458
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,919
we just talked that this combination is

459
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,080
important for the effects okay cancer

460
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,640
it's a given name to thousands of

461
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,558
different diseases we have in our body

462
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,799
220ome different types of cells. Each

463
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:14,678
type of cell have different types of

464
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:17,440
cancer. Our you know lung cancer, breast

465
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,600
cancer, skin cancer are totally

466
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,038
different. It's a different diseases.

467
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:25,839
But even in one type of cancer, breast

468
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,319
cancer, we have 20ome different types.

469
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,240
So altogether you're talking about

470
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,359
thousands of different chemovirus of

471
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,759
cannabis and thousands of different

472
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,719
diseases. And now my goal in my lab or

473
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,519
my what I'm trying is to

474
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,919
match a specific cannabis to a specific

475
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,839
cancer. So it's not that cannabis can

476
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,640
cure cancer or cannabis can treat

477
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,359
cancer. There are specific types of

478
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,120
cannabis or molecules in the cannabis

479
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:58,000
they might help or cure specific types

480
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,879
of cancer. So that's first of all let's

481
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,079
bring it back to earth. Okay. Right. But

482
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,600
if at least in three cases, three types

483
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,678
of cancers and mutation, we already know

484
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,519
which cannabis, which which combination

485
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,759
of

486
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:16,798
molecules can kill this cancer when you

487
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,000
have this mutation. So in leukemia with

488
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,279
a specific mutation called notch one

489
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,119
mutation, I already know what are the

490
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,960
molecules in the cannabis that will

491
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,199
always kill the cells. So if a leukemia

492
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,400
patient have a mutation called notch one

493
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,279
and 50% of the leukemia patient it's not

494
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,120
all the leukemia but it's around 60%

495
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:41,440
actually okay so this type of cancer

496
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:43,678
will treat as a chem chemotherapy or

497
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,000
radiation without all the side effects

498
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,440
and everything right but the idea it

499
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,960
would be the same it's killing the

500
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:56,240
cancer cells so we have three types of

501
00:22:50,960 --> 00:23:00,400
cancers like that and and we are in two

502
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,720
of them we started the process I open a

503
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,759
company raise money we started the

504
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,558
process to go to clinical trials that's

505
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:12,759
one and on the other hand we created

506
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:17,399
products cannabis product extracts or or

507
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:20,400
flowers that we aiming the specific

508
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,400
patient not to take a general cannabis

509
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,120
to take this cannabis and usually I'm

510
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,519
very gentle on that. I'm I'm saying if

511
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,279
you have leukemia and you have this type

512
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,960
of leukemia and you're already going to

513
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,798
take cannabis and you don't know what

514
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,960
you're taking and you don't care, why

515
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,119
won't you take this? Okay, that we have

516
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,880
science on that and research and we know

517
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,279
it's no I'm not coming to the patient

518
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,440
this will cure you. I said if you're

519
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,839
taking it arbitrarily and you don't know

520
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,038
what you're taking and it's just you

521
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:54,079
know trial and error start with this.

522
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,319
Mhm. This I can think can help you and

523
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,079
then we are following on the p following

524
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,678
on the patient they're taking looking

525
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,678
the improvement and and and so and

526
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:06,960
so we are doing that. Yes. Excellent.

527
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,679
And it's again phenomenal. It's it's

528
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,880
amazing feeling you know a scientist

529
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,720
usually like me even when you finding

530
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:21,600
something and you have amazing findings

531
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:25,120
in the lab until a patient will touch it

532
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:28,480
it's 10 15 years something like that you

533
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:32,079
know when I did my posto in Toronto

534
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,480
father of one of the PhD student that

535
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,439
was that works with me and she's still a

536
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,319
good

537
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,700
He was a very important scientist in in

538
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,038
Vancouver

539
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:46,840
[Music]

540
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:48,919
and he was the ones that invent the the

541
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:53,359
Fiser COVID

542
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:55,360
19 vaccination. Okay. So he won you know

543
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,798
all the prizes in the world after that

544
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,240
he become a billionaire but this is a

545
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:03,359
different story. um he he came to give a

546
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,240
talk in my university a few months ago

547
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,639
and he he stand and he

548
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,240
said it's it's amazing how we succeed to

549
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,840
create a medicine in in eight months to

550
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,960
this virus but now in my talk I want to

551
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:21,839
show you that it took 40

552
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:25,000
years that it took me 40 years okay so

553
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:28,798
I'm coming back to what I meant to

554
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,519
say usually to a scientist in the up to

555
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:35,599
have a results and to affect a

556
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:38,000
patient if he's lucky and if he's you

557
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:42,918
know amazing and then got a Nobel Prize

558
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,079
it's 15 20 years in my field in my work

559
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:50,000
sometimes we finding something and two

560
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,399
weeks after it can already be in in I

561
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,640
can already recommend the patient or

562
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,360
help a patient with that because the

563
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,640
product is on the shelf I just need to

564
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:05,519
point him to what we found and think and

565
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,960
and this is very unique situation very

566
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:12,319
unique feeling I'm very

567
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:15,519
very careful or you know I don't know

568
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,158
how to say that very I'm not saying

569
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,960
things that I'm not

570
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,919
100% sure about them when I not 100%

571
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,079
sure that it will help and not make do a

572
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,038
damage but when you know something and

573
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,480
you help. It's really good feeling. So

574
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,038
that's interesting. So it's a unique

575
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,240
situation that patients kind of have

576
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,240
access to this medicine um early on

577
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,120
where that's not typically the case with

578
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,038
other other compounds. They have they

579
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,199
have an access to the medicine before

580
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,960
you pure you prove it's really a

581
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,798
medicine. So yeah, they have the access

582
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,798
before they have the knowledge. Right.

583
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,158
Exactly.

584
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:53,440
Interesting. So you talked about

585
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,200
canabonoids and you talked about rare

586
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,600
canabonoids. um one that you mentioned

587
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,278
that was just numbers instead of instead

588
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,240
of letters the alphabet soup that we

589
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,000
typically deal with. Um now is that a a

590
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,079
common finding that these rare

591
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,480
canabonoids in the low concentrations

592
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,639
are find are offering more promise

593
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,558
perhaps than the ones we know and love

594
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:19,278
like THC, CBD, CBG.

595
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:22,558
So I will say the 50% in the cases.

596
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:25,038
Sometimes it's CBG, CBC, CBDV the more

597
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,720
known ones. Yeah,

598
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,839
but in half of the cases is the rare

599
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,720
cannabonoids. But I want to say

600
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,439
something, okay, which is

601
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,960
important. If you didn't see it and

602
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,600
never heard about, it doesn't mean that

603
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,759
it's rare, okay? Doesn't mean that it's

604
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,240
low concentration.

605
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,640
So the the molecule that we saw that

606
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,720
killing the leukemia it's unknown

607
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,520
canabonoids it's a new one whatever but

608
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,038
it's the third more expressed in this

609
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,918
strain so it was 2.3%

610
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:02,839
oh really it's not really minor it's not

611
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,278
really rare it's not low

612
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:07,678
percentage if the the the regular

613
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,880
equipment of or the HLC and we don't

614
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,240
have standard so we don't see it usually

615
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,480
doesn't mean that it's rare or or very

616
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,399
in low concentration. Okay. So, usually

617
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:26,120
these are not you know a a a very

618
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:28,278
extremely low concentration. It's not

619
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:30,918
0.001%. It will be

620
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:33,319
0.5% 1%

621
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:37,038
1.5% but it's an

622
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:41,278
unknown molecule. So,

623
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:43,119
so it's a so sort of a limitation.

624
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,558
Sorry for cutting you. If you look on

625
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,879
other plants, okay, even you know today

626
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,278
people talk about a lot of mushroom

627
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,520
functional mushrooms so mushroom if you

628
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:57,278
look on the concentration of the

629
00:28:53,519 --> 00:29:02,720
molecule there which consider active it

630
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:05,519
will be 0.2% 0.5% 0.1%. Mhm. In cannabis

631
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,880
when you saying 0.3% you you think it's

632
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:14,278
it's rare or minor but if you

633
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,880
translate if if if a patient using one

634
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:19,839
gram just for it will be easy to

635
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,440
calculate you know the average amount of

636
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:25,439
a patient in Israel it's

637
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,440
32.5 gram a month so it's an average of

638
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:33,720
one gram okay so

639
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:35,640
if if if a molecule is expressing

640
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,960
0.5% in

641
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,679
this flower. It will be 50 milligram a

642
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,319
day. 50 milligram it's dragable. 50

643
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,159
milligram it's it's it's not low amount

644
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:50,918
for a drug or a molecule to affect your

645
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,760
body. So it's not really a rare or

646
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:56,000
minor. We are wrong to call them like

647
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:59,038
that.

648
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Interesting. So you're saying with the

649
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,679
testing labs or the equipment or sort of

650
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,798
the methods that they're using, there

651
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,640
could be these unknown canabonoids that

652
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,000
are are there in concentrations, but

653
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,840
they're just not seeing it with the

654
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,240
equipment or not reporting it on the on

655
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:19,439
the COA. I'm not saying maybe we know

656
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,960
that like it's after 10 years I can tell

657
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,679
you exactly. Yes, sure. A lot of the

658
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,240
cannabonoids which express in quite high

659
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,240
amount you don't see or you don't

660
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,759
read. Usually the laboratories have the

661
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,679
ability to do that but because it's not

662
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,720
interesting to anybody and it cost more

663
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:44,559
money it will cost instead of you know

664
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,880
$50 or 50 $40 for for the test it will

665
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:49,918
cost

666
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:53,278
$300. Usually the grow not asked for

667
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:56,080
these readings and and usually the

668
00:30:53,278 --> 00:31:00,000
laboratories not developed method to

669
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:03,839
look on them right every good laboratory

670
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,839
in the US that have masspec or GCMS can

671
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:10,678
take my paper read it and in one day be

672
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,839
able to see that okay it's not something

673
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,159
that it's

674
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:19,038
difficult there is no economic demand

675
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,760
for Yeah. Right. And and that's that's

676
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:25,119
the reason it's a mistake in my opinion.

677
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:27,440
You know, that's how I work. But well,

678
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:29,918
that's why for sure I want to know.

679
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,038
Okay. Well, that's why we bring all

680
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,640
these different people together for

681
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,640
Canmed, right? That's why we bring the

682
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,360
researchers, the doctors, the testing

683
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,519
labs, the cultivators all together. So,

684
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:43,278
um, so that they Yeah. And this is why I

685
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:46,480
love Canad so much. You know it's very

686
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:51,000
scientific from one hand but very the

687
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:55,519
variety of people the the the pe

688
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,079
the the you covered so many areas you

689
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:03,278
know from cultivation analytics the

690
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:05,439
medical even recreational all of that

691
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:09,200
coming together from very good

692
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,720
scientists researchers physicians you

693
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,000
know activism And it's it's an amazing

694
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,960
venue to to learn and to show the the

695
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,720
new data.

696
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,000
Excellent. Um so winding down here,

697
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Daddy, we we open by talking about your

698
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,558
last 10 years in in cannabis research

699
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,880
and where we've come. Where do you see

700
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,918
cannabis based cancer therapies in the

701
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,640
next 10 years?

702
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,799
So again, I will divide it to countries

703
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,120
that have medical cannabis mainly to

704
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,839
countries that it's legalization and

705
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,918
something like that because it's a

706
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:50,079
different point of view. Okay. In

707
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,240
Israel, cannabis it's a medicine. It's a

708
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:56,079
medicine being prescribed by a

709
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,640
physician under healthcare and you get

710
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:02,158
it in pharmacy like every other drug.

711
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,720
It's actually one of the most prescribed

712
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,640
medicines in Israel, but it's a totally

713
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,640
medicine and we succeeding. I'm saying

714
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,320
we because, you know, I'm the adviser

715
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,600
for the Ministry of Health for

716
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,439
psychedelic plans and and by that

717
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:19,839
cannabis and I'm parting the of the

718
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,440
regulation and I'm, you know, I'm I'm

719
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:26,519
feeling part of the the movement in

720
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:31,480
Israel that doing that. We

721
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:35,519
succeed to bring it to the mainstream of

722
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:38,240
treatment. A physician eight years ago,

723
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,679
nine years ago when I started said on my

724
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,399
on my dead body that somebody will

725
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,159
prescribe cannabis in my department and

726
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,759
today there is no physician that not

727
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,880
prescribing cannabis. It's become

728
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,839
common. Okay, first of all, second we

729
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,480
succeed to bring the cannabis or to try

730
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,639
to take it to the next level. Okay, to

731
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,480
bring cannabis which is evidence-based

732
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,320
already. Okay. So we doing branding now

733
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,319
with the biggest pharma company in

734
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,039
Israel and with the healthcare in

735
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:12,319
Israel. A branding said evidence-based

736
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:15,440
and the meaning we said every cannabis

737
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,119
strain then being tested. We know the

738
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,599
molecule. We know that it's good for

739
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,159
that indication. We we we did a clinical

740
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,480
trials on on patient not FDA approved

741
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,800
clinical trials but test it on real

742
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,320
patient. It's evidence-based and now a

743
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,720
physician can prescribe it like a

744
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,800
medicine. He can prescribe when he knows

745
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,719
what are the active molecules, what is

746
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,800
the mechanism of action. So if you know

747
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,118
the mechanism, what is the drug drug

748
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,720
interaction with other drugs, how it's

749
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,280
work and then dozing the side effect, he

750
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,199
can he can treat it as a medicine. You

751
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,760
need to understand a physician that come

752
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,279
to prescribe a physician study in Israel

753
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,119
seven years and then you have another

754
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:02,000
five years of kind of you know before he

755
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,200
become tenure and whatever like 12 15

756
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,960
years he's studying and now you ask him

757
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,759
to prescribe something that he had no

758
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,440
clue about it. Mhm. He said what the

759
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,960
[ __ ] why I study 15 years you know if if

760
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,480
I know nothing but if you give him the

761
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,079
tools he said okay this product this is

762
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,079
the mechanism of action these are the

763
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,839
molecules this is how it's act this is

764
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,599
the dozing this is the side effect you

765
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,759
need to be careful then that then you

766
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,480
become a physician

767
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,119
and giving these tools bring cannabis

768
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,480
and the treatment to the next level that

769
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,920
I believe that is extremely important

770
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:43,920
okay and and I see how It's open gates.

771
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,599
How it's open the mind of the physician,

772
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,680
the

773
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:52,359
regulation, the health care. You bring

774
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:55,239
it to something more accurate, more

775
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:58,799
professional and and most

776
00:35:55,239 --> 00:36:02,159
important, you help the patient to get

777
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,880
better treatment. you know, we we we

778
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:08,799
started treating cannabis in a trial and

779
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,440
error, you know, with sentences or a

780
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,280
phrasing like start slow, you know,

781
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,880
start low, go slow, you know, and think

782
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,560
about that you have a migraine and

783
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,280
you're taking a pill and you

784
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,559
have 20 pills and the physician said

785
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,800
every time that you have a migraine,

786
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:30,559
start low, go slow. No, you know the

787
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,039
dozing, you the migraine is off. Okay,

788
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,759
this is accurate treatment then you know

789
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,838
a patient know on his body the best or

790
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,400
sentence like that the meaning that we

791
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:42,480
don't know how to

792
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:46,200
recommend that's the meaning of you know

793
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,838
trial and error and bringing to more

794
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:52,719
accurate will

795
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:55,000
reduce you know this trial and error

796
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:58,159
increase the success

797
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,358
rate and and having a better treatment

798
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:04,319
to patient I hope so. This is I think

799
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:08,000
the next generation, the next three,

800
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,640
five years in in medical cannabis. Make

801
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,239
it a specific treatment, accurate

802
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:17,598
treatment, not anymore. No try 10

803
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:21,199
strains and then decide which one is

804
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,039
helping you to sleep and then to take go

805
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:24,919
to this strain. This is go to sleep

806
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:28,719
because it's good to sleep because of

807
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,680
this molecule, these combinations, this

808
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:34,559
complexity, but we will

809
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:36,319
know to direct the patient better.

810
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,239
Yeah. So I mean I would imagine in order

811
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,119
for that to work there needs to be

812
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:43,679
accuracy in the testing and consistency

813
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,400
in the product. Correct.

814
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:49,039
The the product is very consistent in

815
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,838
the last I would say five six years. You

816
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:56,400
know when we started to work 10 years

817
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:58,519
ago cannabis grow outside and then there

818
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,519
was a different between summer and

819
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:04,000
winter and you can said white widow but

820
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:07,838
then you test them genetic and 10 of

821
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,079
them were different strains. Okay. I

822
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:12,078
don't see that anymore. Not at least in

823
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,640
Israel and in the areas that I'm

824
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,119
working. It's very consistent. It's

825
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,879
growing mostly indoors in very

826
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,720
controlled way.

827
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,200
you the level of growth and the the

828
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,838
product

829
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:30,639
is you can't compare to what was you

830
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:33,639
know few years ago and I think it's

831
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:36,719
consistent and accurate and and now it's

832
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:38,960
easier to do the work and and and again

833
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,959
if we we want to treat it as a medicine

834
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,639
you want it to be consistent you want it

835
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,240
to be

836
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,239
accurate

837
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,159
excellent all right Daddy I do want to

838
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,000
be mindful of your time but Before I let

839
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,719
you go, I want to give you a chance to

840
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,358
share with the listeners or the viewers

841
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,799
um any way that they can read up more on

842
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:58,799
you and the work that you're doing or

843
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,320
possibly connect with you. Uh please

844
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,240
plug any links. I'd be happy to put them

845
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,480
in the show description uh so people can

846
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:07,039
read more.

847
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,358
So I'm a scientist. I'm publishing my

848
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:12,639
papers and then there is you know all

849
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:15,519
the papers is out on PubMed but there is

850
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:18,799
Google Scholar then LinkedIn and all of

851
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:23,599
these you know ways to reach me and to

852
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:26,599
read about my science and there are

853
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,800
previous talk in canmed and

854
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:32,800
other you know

855
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,640
other conferences and things like that

856
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,039
which I don't like people to show that

857
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:39,679
because I'm repeating my jokes. So now

858
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:43,039
it's a problem. Need to work out some

859
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,480
new material. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And

860
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,639
absolutely people should check out those

861
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,838
links and join us in Puerto Rico for

862
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,759
KMAD25 and meet Daddy in person. Thank

863
