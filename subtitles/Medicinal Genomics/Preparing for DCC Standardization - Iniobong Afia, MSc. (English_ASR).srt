1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:08,800
all right my name is inia fia um chief

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,399
science officer at canadasafe today

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,559
we'll be talking a little bit about dcc

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,240
standardization

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,838
and how to prepare for it

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,320
so this is really tailored towards

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,039
analytical labs but it does affect

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,039
everyone here

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,800
perfect

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,679
so um back in october of 2021

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,439
uh

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,519
california senate passed sb 544

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,039
that was essentially about

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
standardization

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,479
right so

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:43,759
let me see my eyesight's pretty good

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,398
so pretty much what sb 544 was meant to

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:50,558
implement provisions of the

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,520
marijuana act right that required

20
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:56,000
the dcc on or before january 1st of next

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,160
year to implement some test methods

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,119
standardized test methods that the labs

23
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,398
can use um in order to test the potency

24
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,558
of marijuana

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,558
um

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,799
it was supposed to be one or more

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
and it should be it can be developed

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
through a reference test lab

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,240
again we'll talk about what that really

30
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,079
means

31
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,399
in the bill there's six cannabinoids

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,000
listed thc ch cbd cbg cbda cbn can you

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
hear me oh you okay i should probably

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,799
stick around here right

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,040
i like to wonder a little bit um

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
so it talks about about six cannabinoids

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,400
the concern

38
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,319
for some of folks is what does this

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
really mean what is standardization and

40
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,279
the fact that the bill only lists

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,159
cannabinoids what does that mean are we

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
going to be

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,200
restricted to only testing six

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,159
cannabinoids

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,359
um

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,040
and

47
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,040
the question is will they really involve

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,200
reference labs or the

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,040
current california testing labs as we

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,640
know there are over 40

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,600
46 i believe or more of them currently

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,519
also

53
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,039
there are lots of questions will it

54
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,920
involve some nist

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
uh

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,519
studies

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,719
i think a lot of labs here if labs here

58
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,078
you'll know that uh there were a lot of

59
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,359
studies performed through this a bit

60
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:12,318
about three of them right now

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,319
and then the question can be asked since

62
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,679
is standardization really a fool's

63
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:20,000
errand given the inherent variability of

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,040
testing or cannabinoids in the plant we

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,318
know that your potency can differ from

66
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,318
different flowers from different parts

67
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,679
of the plant from the top larger buds to

68
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:32,159
the bottom

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,159
so it's really what are we standardizing

70
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,518
will it stifle innovation right it's a

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,519
free market and currently

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,280
each lab validates and tests its own

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
test method for

74
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,919
uh potency just in case anybody asks

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,719
what is test method right when you take

76
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,598
your sample to a lab they stick it on

77
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,598
instrument usually an hplc

78
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,199
for them to be able to run it they have

79
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,439
to develop and test

80
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,518
a method and validate a method right so

81
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,199
that's a test method i'm talking about

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,400
the method that they use to essentially

83
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,000
provide your thc content

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,319
um

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,360
in that validation they essentially

86
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,359
are able to address

87
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,199
certain things certain parameters that

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,439
the dcc set for

89
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,318
okay so one we need clarification of

90
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,318
that build language

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,799
what exactly is to be standardized

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
dcc says you have to validate your

93
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,439
method you're validating looking for

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,439
accuracy linearity range reproducibly

95
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,479
robustness

96
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,239
lod loqs which are a big topic and

97
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,000
specificity

98
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,759
what exactly should we standardize let's

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,199
talk about is it the instrument method

100
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,560
as i just mentioned the instrument

101
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,479
method essentially

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,280
is what is run on the instrument you're

103
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,598
generally using which is an hplc right

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,280
um do you standardize the mobile phases

105
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,079
that are being used the detector type

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,519
that are being used and i you know you

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,439
can ask me later if you have questions

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,719
about those what those really mean

109
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,959
even the column that's being used

110
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,479
very important the sample prep method

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,959
before that sample even gets on an

112
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,318
instrument how do you prepare it

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,598
what do you

114
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,039
dissolve it in what solvents do you use

115
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,519
um

116
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,359
[Music]

117
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,199
and of course the homogenization

118
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,680
probably most importantly the

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,639
homogenization how do you really

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,400
homogenize that sample you're using uh

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,720
that you're about to test and this is

122
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,439
not just about flour even the oils and

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,960
homogenization essentially means uh uh

124
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,120
mixing it i mean i don't think i need to

125
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,758
explain how marginalization but what are

126
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,959
you using a cryomill as in terms of a

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,720
liquid nitrogen are you simply blending

128
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,279
the products what about the matrix

129
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,759
considerations right you have

130
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,359
gummies i mean cannabis is one of those

131
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,360
the cannabis industry is one of those

132
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,680
industries where you can essentially

133
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
test anything in the lab

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,680
i've seen so much that you know every

135
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,599
day i seems to be

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,918
amazed

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,320
in terms of i've tested you know

138
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,719
toothpicks candles

139
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,120
even whole mattresses right folks are

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,160
making mattresses infused with cbd

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,759
how

142
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,360
useful that is i don't know but it's

143
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,840
pretty exciting and pretty challenging

144
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
to test

145
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,399
so the sample matrix considerations

146
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,000
right essentially i just talked about

147
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,439
that

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,279
all this myriad of products that are

149
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,199
infused with cannabinoids how do you

150
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,038
really standardize testing that or is

151
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,720
that what we need to focus on in terms

152
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,759
of standardization rather than the

153
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,759
instrument test method

154
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,319
there's a thought about the use of

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,800
compendium methods we know folks like

156
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:47,199
aoac ascm usp are working on you know

157
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,319
or do have currently standardized test

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,240
methods um should we follow one of those

159
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,159
should the dc think about going through

160
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,319
one of those rather than developing a

161
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,360
new test method

162
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,720
that is required of the lab

163
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,879
the question is does it create

164
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,560
monopolies for instrument or consumable

165
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,319
manufacturers right valid concern um

166
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
generally

167
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,400
when you're creating a test method i

168
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,240
think when you're standardizing it you

169
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,839
there's the general thought that you are

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,519
not designating specific uh vendor part

171
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,279
numbers right let's say for instance a

172
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,359
column you wouldn't say oh you know

173
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,959
that's the test materials only use a

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,120
rustic c18 raptor column right generally

175
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:34,079
there's a nomenclature um like a usb l1

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,759
column that designates a c18 column

177
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,758
i assume things like that will be done

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
let's talk about what happens when there

179
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,839
is no standardization this is really why

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,560
this is important

181
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,679
it's literally the slippery slope of the

182
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,319
slipper slope of lab shopping which i'll

183
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,240
show some data about

184
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,759
as i noted

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,918
what happens when a lot of things are

186
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,960
happening around lab shopping so what

187
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,038
this is is a client

188
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,560
has a batch of flour

189
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,159
and obviously they want to be able to

190
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
sell it for the highest value that they

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,960
can sell it so

192
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,240
you have 48 or so labs in california and

193
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,478
you're going to use as many of them as

194
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,199
possible to see how they compare who's

195
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,959
giving you the appropriate uh or desired

196
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,400
value okay

197
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,918
now i'm not accusing anybody of doing

198
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,000
anything unscrupulous here but

199
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,359
you're going to want to get your best

200
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,879
result

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
so you're taking it to different labs

202
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,399
and they're giving you different numbers

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
and you generally will go with the

204
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,399
highest one and of course it's not done

205
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,720
on a compliance coa because you can only

206
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,318
run that one time so you get an r d test

207
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,360
and then you like them

208
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,720
you rerun it as a compliance

209
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,160
when that happens

210
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,840
essentially um the consumer loses right

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,520
um again not necessarily that all labs

212
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,279
are false fine results but if they

213
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,000
happen to do that you're given a falsely

214
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,159
high potency value for instance and the

215
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,598
consumer loses because they go to a

216
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,639
dispensary and they're paying much

217
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,159
higher for product that's not

218
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,439
necessarily may not necessarily be the

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,000
number that is stated that it is

220
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:11,038
um or even more importantly false

221
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,439
negative results right um so

222
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,199
we're only focusing on potency but think

223
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,639
about the contaminants

224
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,199
you may be paying for something that

225
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,560
should have failed for mold and yeast

226
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,560
or aspergillus right then we get into uh

227
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,598
health concerns and and the general

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,120
public

229
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,560
the buyers and distributors lose because

230
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
they may pay more for potentially

231
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,240
inflated results i mean i don't know how

232
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,000
many times i've seen this where

233
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
you know distributor buys

234
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,958
a batch of product from

235
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,959
someone right and and retests at my lab

236
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,239
and the value is drastically different

237
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,038
generally lower

238
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,720
and

239
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,639
they would ask well what happened here

240
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,959
you know of course sometimes it's higher

241
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,080
but we'll get into why that may be the

242
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,239
case

243
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,399
so that's a loss for them

244
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,480
regulators lose control as you have labs

245
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,039
just giving all sorts of numbers and of

246
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
course arguments can be made around why

247
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,199
these are different especially when

248
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,639
you're talking about flower but when

249
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,480
we're talking about a more homogenized

250
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:08,958
matrix like a an oil um a vape product

251
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,120
it should be a little more stable in

252
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,439
terms of the testing values

253
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,360
and of course the labs lose right so

254
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040
with inflation happening it's funny

255
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,039
we're pretty much like the only industry

256
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,039
where everything's going up but our

257
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,879
prices are going down because of the

258
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,519
competition fighting amongst ourselves

259
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:29,039
to you know get uh

260
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,879
clientele so why is that you know you go

261
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,120
to your vegetables the supermarket are

262
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,240
going up but yet our test cuts are going

263
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,799
down and the consumables that we're

264
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,959
buying are going up so how do you keep

265
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,559
up with um with you know consumables

266
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,639
prices going up or your test costs going

267
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,958
down this explains why you know labs are

268
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,240
going out of business

269
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,479
employees end up losing when this

270
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,360
happens right lab shut down and they end

271
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,360
up on maybe unemployment taxpayers lose

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959
employment increases

273
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
just want to know the timer is not going

274
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,039
so in case i do go over my time you let

275
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,040
me know

276
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,078
let's look at some comparative forum

277
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,000
data

278
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:08,078
um there are plenty of data around uh

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,559
that we've gathered but i chose to sort

280
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,479
of go off of this one

281
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,838
um it's a nice set

282
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,278
just to give you a little glimpse into

283
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
what's happening even the most recent

284
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,200
nest results that came out the

285
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,278
variability amongst it it's really

286
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
interesting so

287
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,519
this is a

288
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,120
comparative data form a client that sent

289
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,159
samples to

290
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,120
labs

291
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,639
about eight labs right they did it two

292
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
ways

293
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,720
it was a well done study where you have

294
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,200
a nice homogenized set of flower in this

295
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,560
case and when i say clean it's generally

296
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,560
there were no contaminants right we're

297
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,159
gonna focus on potency on this one

298
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,359
so they send this clean homogenized

299
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,319
flour essentially ground up finally to

300
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,320
about eight labs

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
you can kind of see starting with terps

302
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,319
let's look at the relative standard

303
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
deviation

304
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,440
obviously there was a one lab that had a

305
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,519
terp content of 3.78

306
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,040
which is quite rare in flower

307
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,440
um

308
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,958
it's an outlier kind of sticks out why

309
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,880
is that on a ground flower that was sent

310
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,239
to you still got 3.78

311
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,559
i believe that results as falls you

312
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,919
could see the congruency amongst the

313
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,919
other lab data

314
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,360
and total thc

315
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,879
about 21

316
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,919
or so percentage

317
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,720
moisture was relatively stable right

318
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,559
i like to go for under 10 rsd but that

319
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,399
wasn't the case here

320
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,559
and um

321
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,958
comparatively this was a whole set of

322
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,799
flower so one was ground up and the

323
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,838
other was not whole buds were sent and

324
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,240
it was

325
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,480
determined or it was uh set that the bud

326
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,600
sizes were generally about the same

327
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,039
right so you can kind of discount uh the

328
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,519
thought that well it could have been

329
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,519
different buzz sizes and whatnot

330
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,440
so notice what happens here notice the

331
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:58,879
increase in total thc the mean value

332
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,720
of the same cultivar right from 21.6 to

333
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,078
about 28.5

334
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,519
that's quite a jump

335
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,559
from the same

336
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,200
flower right same product

337
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,638
moisture stayed relatively the same

338
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
total terps

339
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,879
increase a little bit relatively the

340
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,679
same

341
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,039
okay

342
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,919
notice how

343
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,799
there was a about a 32 percent increase

344
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,360
in uh in in that mean potency value but

345
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,479
specifically lab seven had a

346
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,879
point jump right that's a 59 increase in

347
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,680
their total thc from the flower that was

348
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,480
homogenized one that was not of the same

349
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,120
uh cultivar that's a huge jump so

350
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,120
everybody generally went up when the

351
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,720
flower was not homogenized

352
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
and it was sent to them

353
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,720
so why is that

354
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,958
interestingly you'll see that

355
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,200
even the non-homogenized flower

356
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:52,399
the rsd is actually lower than the

357
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,959
homogenized one right around 11

358
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,480
so everybody was around the same

359
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,919
but much higher

360
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,000
right so you can see

361
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,919
where things kind of get a little tricky

362
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,600
here when you're doing um

363
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,919
when labs are doing the home own

364
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,399
homogenization and yes you can note that

365
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,519
homogenization is usually the key here

366
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,519
to these numbers

367
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,199
really interesting now you think

368
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,838
as

369
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:22,240
a distributor you know you get a lot

370
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,240
more money for second data set right

371
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,120
let's look at contaminants this time so

372
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
the same vendor or client

373
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,480
saying

374
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,560
sent the same thing again focusing on

375
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,399
contaminants this time she spiked it

376
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,799
with a aspergillus right for the same

377
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,000
lab sets to do the same

378
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,278
assay

379
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,799
contaminated homogenized flour

380
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,480
let's not focus on the potency but you

381
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,359
could see terps again kind of funky all

382
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,320
over the place moisture

383
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,480
and

384
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,760
now the labs knew a little bit more what

385
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,440
was happening right because it's coming

386
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,799
from the same vendor and you can see

387
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,639
that the potency is generally higher

388
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,679
when they know what the client expects

389
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,720
right

390
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,039
but

391
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,320
the comedy labs sort of failed or i

392
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,078
should say

393
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,160
were accurate for detecting the

394
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,719
aspergillus which was well done again

395
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,198
this was well spiked and it was

396
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,480
made homogenously it was sent in by

397
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,359
microbiologist so she knew what she was

398
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,199
doing um there was a 62 accuracy in

399
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
detecting aspergillus

400
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:23,278
okay

401
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,958
um

402
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,799
of course

403
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,719
you'll

404
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,639
yo you'll see what's happening here now

405
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,399
when you look at a 62 percent um

406
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,959
accuracy in detecting aspergillus that's

407
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,320
concerning right so

408
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,278
product that's out there does it have

409
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,959
the same

410
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,039
rate of accuracy in the testing

411
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,359
aspergillus

412
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,399
when the flower was not homogenized

413
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,320
guess what

414
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,799
only two labs got it right

415
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,720
right again it was well done but this

416
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,439
time it was not ground up flower it was

417
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,519
not homogenized

418
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,000
and keep in mind that how it would

419
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,720
normally be sent to the lab would be

420
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,039
non-homogenized you know whole bud so

421
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,240
now only two labs got it right

422
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,838
really really interesting and really

423
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
really scary so forget about the potency

424
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,639
lab shopping now we talk about public

425
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,039
health right public safety and and and

426
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,159
contaminants

427
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,198
it's important to note that some of

428
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,759
these labs i think at least one use a

429
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,439
plate to play for aspergillus you know

430
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,159
there's a whole lot it could go down

431
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,279
rabbit hole around why that wasn't um

432
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,639
probably appropriate but that was done

433
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,039
so

434
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,879
you may note that one lab

435
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,399
noted two species of course there could

436
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,159
be some cross hybridization things

437
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,559
happening but the point is that they

438
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:41,759
detected and failed the sample but only

439
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:45,119
two labs um got it right

440
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,120
and of course my lab's one of those

441
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,720
so is there a solution to all this

442
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,680
um

443
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,320
well

444
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,519
yeah you know there are solutions need

445
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,600
to increase oversight of cannabis

446
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,600
testing labs and their methods

447
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,720
okay um

448
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,360
i implore dcc to really uh step up their

449
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,959
game in the oversight especially in

450
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
knowing exactly what to look for when

451
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,278
they're auditing laboratories and the

452
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,599
test methods they're using

453
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,159
should perform on schedule

454
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
unscheduled blind round robins right a

455
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,439
lot of times

456
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,279
you'll note that if a stata or some kind

457
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,120
of regulator wants to send a blind

458
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,639
around robin through a lab everybody

459
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
knows what's happening generally the

460
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,000
numbers will be congruent they'll look

461
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,159
good be like hey what's the problem

462
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,679
everything's good right but if you do on

463
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,919
schedule where they don't know that it's

464
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,599
sent by the state or whatnot you'll see

465
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,000
maybe a little bit of

466
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,600
truth around that i know all labs are

467
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,039
required to perform proficiency testing

468
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,240
and they all do and they all pass

469
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,519
otherwise they wouldn't keep their

470
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,680
licenses or be able to test for those so

471
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,278
of course when you are taking a

472
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,120
proficiency test you know exactly what

473
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,399
you're doing and you're going to do

474
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,039
things

475
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,039
appropriately

476
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,600
let's thought of maybe the producers and

477
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,800
cultivators should test in-house

478
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,278
okay

479
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,038
obviously as a lab i don't necessarily

480
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,078
want that but i don't necessarily mind

481
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:07,919
that

482
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,359
but of course there's a lot

483
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,919
to be considered when you're trying to

484
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,639
have them test in-house and knowing what

485
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,000
to be expected before they send it out

486
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,839
so if a cultivator or distributor says

487
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,119
why is this 30 if they were testing

488
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,678
in-house and they already know that's

489
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,438
not oh that's not 30

490
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,880
they wouldn't blame the lab for not

491
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,319
reaching that right they would at least

492
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,319
know what they're starting out with

493
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:36,879
um importantly is solidify the category

494
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,759
one pesticide limits of detection

495
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
so

496
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,038
right now

497
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,038
the state essentially allows labs to set

498
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,839
their own lods especially for category

499
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:45,919
one

500
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,279
based on their method on instrumentation

501
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,759
there's a cap right 0.1 ppm but the labs

502
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,279
are able to push that limit we know the

503
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:57,038
instruments can detect a lot lower than

504
00:17:53,279 --> 00:18:00,000
that it's interesting to see from 2018

505
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,400
starting out here in california the labs

506
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
their lods everybody was going for as

507
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,798
low as possible right we want to be able

508
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,400
to catch everything as the years go by

509
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,879
you keep on seeing people see always

510
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,440
creeping up it's like oh we used to go

511
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,480
at .001

512
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,919
to you know point zero zero eight and it

513
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,919
just keeps creeping up and now

514
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,759
everybody's pushing point one well hey

515
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,919
the state allows it right why not why

516
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,319
not uh take advantage of it if you can

517
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,400
push the limit of the limit of detection

518
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,119
essentially not failing as many people

519
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,160
for those category one contaminants and

520
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,918
of course those category one

521
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,640
contaminants are ones that you don't

522
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,440
want uh present essentially they're

523
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,000
banned right but there's a residue limit

524
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,200
that is expected for labs to be able to

525
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,519
um

526
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,519
reach

527
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,640
you could place limits on thc content

528
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:55,119
all right so uh recent mississippi rules

529
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,759
was uh is now placing limits on well if

530
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,959
it sticks i think it's the initial

531
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,558
um

532
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,679
they're making flowers fell like 30

533
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,440
percent

534
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,519
so it's like why

535
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,880
while you know there's thought about how

536
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,558
much can the flower really how much

537
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,080
season can the flower really produce

538
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,240
biologically

539
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,798
can it really make 30 of its use 30

540
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,640
percent of its mass is only thc

541
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,359
what about all the other compounds and

542
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,960
when we're getting above 30

543
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,558
you know is that true

544
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,880
of course there's considerations like

545
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,879
we're testing by dry weight meaning if

546
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,080
you test flour you test as is so you get

547
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,120
a 20 flour but it's 10

548
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,199
um

549
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,678
you dry it down and it's really 10

550
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
moisture so essentially adding you know

551
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,798
it's not apples for apples but

552
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,759
essentially you're adding 10 more to

553
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:44,879
that final number right so 20 becomes

554
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,400
like a 22 or so because you have to test

555
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,600
buy dry

556
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,120
weight

557
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,480
so

558
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,839
for instance if you're in mississippi

559
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,160
well forget about growing anything good

560
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,558
right if you're you know 27

561
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,440
30 you're off and they're adding in all

562
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,879
the thc variant into the total thc

563
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,480
calculation but there's thought should

564
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,120
we place limits on that they're also

565
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,839
doing 60 for tinctures and oils and oils

566
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,839
and concentrates

567
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,558
is that should that be the case i'm not

568
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,240
saying that this should be the case at

569
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,558
all but it's

570
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,798
to be considered

571
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,399
and of course uh with eventually there

572
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,319
will be federal oversight and i think

573
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,080
that will really mitigate some of this

574
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,240
unscrupulous activities that happens

575
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,558
when you have federal oversight of these

576
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,319
products um

577
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,759
you know i've been in the pharmaceutical

578
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,439
industry for years and then i went to

579
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,480
nutraceutical and finally cannabis it's

580
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,000
kind of interesting to see the shift um

581
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,038
initially when i came into the cannabis

582
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,480
industry analytical side i had to

583
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,879
i was coming in with the pharmaceutical

584
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,480
mindset of really strict regulations and

585
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,880
trying to apply that but that didn't

586
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,279
really apply in this industry you had to

587
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,200
i to step back and relax myself and go

588
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,639
with the actual rules right i can't

589
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,558
implement rules that are not being

590
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,880
regulated um

591
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,720
by the regulatory bodies so but when

592
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,760
there's federal oversight you better

593
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,919
believe there's going to be a lot

594
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,359
straighter rules around this and all

595
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,759
these uh you know

596
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,759
lab shopping will essentially cease to

597
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,319
be um yeah there will always be folks

598
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,558
out there that can do what they want but

599
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,399
i believe it'll cease to be

600
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,839
so how can labs really prepare for

601
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,880
standardization

602
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,879
um well

603
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,079
luckily sb 544 now allows dcc authority

604
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,678
to set regulations for the list of

605
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,759
contaminants and the respective action

606
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,038
levels so

607
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,879
as much as we would like them to change

608
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,480
things some things cannot be changed

609
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,640
that easily because you have to go

610
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,400
through the regulatory red tape

611
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,799
everybody has sign off the governor all

612
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,480
of the above right so

613
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,480
now that the department of cannabis

614
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,159
control will have that authority they'll

615
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,038
be able to hopefully make effective

616
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,880
change a lot more quickly as to

617
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,319
the contaminant list right i know

618
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
there'll be a talk here about increasing

619
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,879
those contaminant lists man where were

620
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,880
all you guys before

621
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,879
so they'll be able to that uh

622
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,720
contaminant list and it'll make things a

623
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,720
little bit easier you'll be able to

624
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,319
speak directly to them and hopefully

625
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,319
we'll be able to see effective change

626
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,480
when they're able to have that power to

627
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,440
do this

628
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,798
well you should ensure that your

629
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,000
instruments meet the sensitivity

630
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:19,599
requirements that will probably change

631
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,880
right so

632
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,480
labs set up with different instruments i

633
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,400
was speaking of somebody using place for

634
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,400
aspergillus you know

635
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,759
hopefully that will cease to exist

636
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,519
um because unless you have the

637
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,679
appropriate staff who can and

638
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:35,440
appropriate methodologies to

639
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,038
to to to really speciate aspergillus on

640
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,640
plates you probably shouldn't be using

641
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,640
it there should be molecular methods

642
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,319
you should start validating to compendio

643
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,080
methods aoac smpr asem usp

644
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,158
start validating to those make sure your

645
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,918
validation is robust so that whatever

646
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,799
the state does come up with you'll

647
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,080
probably meet it to begin with right i

648
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,079
it's interesting because i doubt the

649
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,720
state will really force anybody into a

650
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,399
method but again just speculating we

651
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
don't know we're still learning what

652
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,840
they're going to do or we're waiting to

653
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,520
know what exactly they will do

654
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,879
you should run proficiency tests in the

655
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,038
cannabis matrix you know this is

656
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,960
important for the proficiency

657
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,480
pt providers

658
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,600
you know the industry has really grown

659
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,440
initially everything used to be

660
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,519
insolvent yeah i can take anything in

661
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,519
solvent shoot and it looks great forever

662
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,759
until you run in matrix it's funny the

663
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,798
initial data that used to come from uh

664
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,919
from

665
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:34,158
some of the industry folks it was all

666
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,240
insolvent and that you'd run it day to

667
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,000
day in your instrument on your column

668
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,720
and find out it's not robust it doesn't

669
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,640
last because this wasn't done in matrix

670
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,079
you have to do this in matrix i can't

671
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,080
say enough how

672
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,319
complicated and complex the cannabis

673
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,879
matrix is it throws a lot of curveballs

674
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,839
when you're trying to validate in matrix

675
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,039
so

676
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,480
to make sure that you're doing things

677
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,558
right you should run your proficiency

678
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,480
test in matrix it means it should be

679
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,038
supplied in a cannabis matrix or at

680
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,759
least a cannabis similar matrix that way

681
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,278
you know that your methods are robust

682
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,359
and you're actually getting

683
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,960
accurate values

684
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,599
you should evaluate your homogenization

685
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,360
methods for consistency you know i got a

686
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,439
key point here for folks who are taking

687
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,839
notes yeah homogenization is key to some

688
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,600
of these numbers

689
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:22,720
so when you're looking at gummies and

690
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,399
you get you know 10 packs of

691
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,519
20 count gummies so you have a couple

692
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,960
hundred of them and you're supposed to

693
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,679
marginalize that how do you really do

694
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
that

695
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,720
well the rules kind of leave it open

696
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,159
right some people say oh open all the

697
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,880
bags and throw them together shake them

698
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,000
up that's homogenization you know others

699
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,240
melt it down right that's homogenized

700
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,319
others cryogrind it with liquid nitrogen

701
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,558
to fine powder that's homogenized but

702
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,038
this needs to be standardized in order

703
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,359
to be able to effectively

704
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,759
make sure you're consistent

705
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,519
evaluate the crm vendors right certified

706
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,558
reference material vendors and stability

707
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,200
of mixed components um i can't

708
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,839
say how much many times i've been able

709
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,640
to kind of prove crm vendors wrong that

710
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,240
their mixture was not stable right um

711
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,840
not trying to boast out there but there

712
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,558
are when you're trying to put all these

713
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,639
components into one vial and say oh this

714
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,399
will last for two years well generally

715
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,559
they found that it doesn't right and the

716
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,080
industry has matured and they found they

717
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,158
need to separate some of these compounds

718
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,960
as they do not mix well and remain

719
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,799
stable in solution

720
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,440
be ready to run and maintain multiple

721
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,278
methods and and instrument methods

722
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,798
because chances are a lot of you are

723
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,000
already doing it right a lot of labs are

724
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:33,119
already running and

725
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,278
maintaining

726
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,119
multiple methods so just

727
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,159
if the dcc does require that you will be

728
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,759
using that

729
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,159
you probably gonna have to run multiple

730
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,079
methods

731
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,000
so with that

732
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,319
right on time i'd like to take some

733
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,558
questions

734
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,558
yes

735
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,479
sorry i'm short here yeah

736
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,960
thank you very much and thank you for

737
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,720
the hard work that you do with dcc

738
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,679
um i have a couple of questions for you

739
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,600
one is my understanding is the dcc

740
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,480
requires laboratories to be iso

741
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:17,359
accredited is that correct yes okay how

742
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:19,038
familiar is dcc with iso 17025 well you

743
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,158
know honestly a lot of the

744
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:24,798
regulators uh the members of the dcc did

745
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,559
come from like environmental side and

746
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,240
pharmaceuticals so they should be very

747
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,158
familiar with it and they do require

748
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,558
that accreditation but interestingly

749
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,480
whenever an audit happens there's

750
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,319
usually they're not touching on that

751
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,240
right so i would expect them to touch

752
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:41,439
more on that side of that accreditation

753
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,440
of the requirement coalition okay um you

754
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,919
made a couple of comments that i'm i'm

755
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,679
hoping you can clarify for me

756
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,960
um

757
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,360
one is you said all methods need to be

758
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,159
validated

759
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:58,479
first you said that all in-house methods

760
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,159
for potency are in-house methods that

761
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,480
the laboratory has to validate and then

762
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,080
later in your presentation you mentioned

763
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,679
that a standard test method could be

764
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,678
used a compendial method such as aoac

765
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,798
correct yes okay

766
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,360
so

767
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,480
i'm wondering and help me understand

768
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,278
this

769
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,360
if a laboratory is using a standardized

770
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:22,960
compendial method let's say something

771
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:25,359
from i think you quoted usp or aoac

772
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
whatever

773
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,519
do you allow the laboratories in

774
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,679
california to verify their ability to

775
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,879
meet the standard compendial method

776
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,919
requirements or do you re which is

777
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,760
required by iso 17025

778
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,080
or do you

779
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,759
require the laboratories to ignore that

780
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,199
part of 17025 and require them to

781
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,079
validate

782
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,038
um even a standardized compendium test

783
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,798
method

784
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,200
that's part one of my question in part

785
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,599
two of my question is

786
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,840
if at some point they make a minor

787
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,798
change to one of their methods let's say

788
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,079
they're

789
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,079
moving from a 20 gram or 20 milligram

790
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,119
sample size to a

791
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,879
18 milligram sample size do you require

792
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,479
them to go through the whole validation

793
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,919
process all over again ah so i'm not dcc

794
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,079
but very important a great question

795
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,480
for one this really revolves around

796
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,879
standard operating procedures right so

797
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,038
if you're running a compendium method

798
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
you should at minimum verify that in

799
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,119
your laboratory on your instrument you

800
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,639
it's not required to do a full

801
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,479
validation now i say that because the

802
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,480
dcc has done it several ways where in

803
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,120
the microbial section they require full

804
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,880
validation regardless right you bring it

805
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,278
in house you do a full validation but on

806
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,520
the more chemical methods it's been at

807
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,480
minimum verification this is important

808
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,240
in your sops because per iso regulations

809
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,599
i mean iso is really about doing what

810
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,278
you say you're doing right so if you

811
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,119
write in your sops that i will only be

812
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,398
verifying compendium methods for these

813
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,918
certain parameters

814
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,278
you should do that

815
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,799
and that's really how it should be done

816
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,278
there would be really no need to

817
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,359
re-validate it in its entirety a

818
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:08,798
compendium method since a lot of that

819
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,798
work was done

820
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,079
so no yeah it would be based on your sop

821
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:16,079
and you should revalidate you should

822
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,918
do that based on your sop if you do

823
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,398
change a parameter of the method that's

824
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,000
a compendium method

825
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,918
again those parameters could be based on

826
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
your sops but we all know of what the

827
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,000
standard is yes you should revalidate

828
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,278
the entire thing if the method calls for

829
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,038
a certain column a c18 45 millimeter

830
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,038
length or whatever and you change it to

831
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,240
i don't know hydrophilic column that's a

832
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,839
whole new

833
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,440
validation because you're not following

834
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,599
the compendium method

835
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,960
one more question if i may

836
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:47,038
um and that is around your crms so

837
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,679
certified reference material i believe

838
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:53,359
those are accredited also to an iso

839
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,480
standard yes right yes um does the dcc

840
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,240
require the laboratory to to

841
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,798
establish the shelf life of those

842
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,798
standards once they've been cracked open

843
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,879
so no they don't and that's very

844
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,879
important point they really should right

845
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,960
so the vendors yeah they do validate

846
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,480
this but they haven't done any shelf

847
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,558
life testing

848
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,558
at least long term anyway i think

849
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,398
they're starting to now or there's some

850
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,918
have already but generally i don't see

851
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,359
it right so they're not testing

852
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,960
stability a lot of times i've seen them

853
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,798
do it in the process they introduce the

854
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,960
product out there it's good when

855
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,398
produced and then they're doing a study

856
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,079
concurrently

857
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,319
you know a few months later you get this

858
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,558
amendment of a coa oh we found out that

859
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,839
this is no longer this so you know you

860
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,240
have to get the product out there at the

861
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:39,119
same time so i think the difference is

862
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,359
that the crm comes with an expiration

863
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,000
date on it it does right and it could be

864
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,240
for five years or two years or whatever

865
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,679
but that expiration date is null and

866
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,159
voided as soon as as soon as you open it

867
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,519
vial is cracked open so if i get a

868
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,320
standard today

869
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,960
and it expires in five years let's say

870
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:01,038
it expires in 2027

871
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,480
as soon as i open it

872
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:06,879
the crm provider has absolutely no way

873
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,200
to develop or know what that shelf life

874
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,760
is exactly the only thing that ownership

875
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,919
is on the laboratory not on the vendor

876
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,679
is on the lab exactly and some of these

877
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,960
things that happen that you may suspect

878
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,880
is unscrupulous is really just

879
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,360
negligence right if you're calibrating

880
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,440
and you have some old thc standard

881
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,079
that's mixed and opens they're stored in

882
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,480
your freezer that thc is converting to

883
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,720
thc over time and now you're inflating

884
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,240
your thc value and deflating your thca

885
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,919
you see how that can happen so yes the

886
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,599
owners is on the lab to make sure that

887
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,519
yeah so that responsibility shifts to

888
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,759
the lab not on the crm

889
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,240
anyone yes yes it should be but i do

890
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,558
expect that the crm vendor will at least

891
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,038
make some sort of i don't know

892
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,879
based on responsibility for liz limiting

893
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,640
that knowing that this will be opened

894
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,519
and used

895
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,799
i think it should be a shared

896
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
responsibility but that's just my

897
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,720
opinion thank you very much for your

898
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,720
help thank you

899
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,798
i think thank you for the presentation i

900
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,000
had a question on the rpd that's allowed

901
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,000
by the state

902
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,359
for every single method it's plus or

903
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,640
minus 30

904
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,479
right at

905
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,360
par per trillion levels

906
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,200
that's

907
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,158
acceptable at percent levels as a

908
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,480
disaster so anybody that's plus or minus

909
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,559
30 on their potency numbers is well

910
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,679
within the regulations of the dcc

911
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:28,000
so the question is if they are going to

912
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,399
be coming up with

913
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,839
certified or reference methods is

914
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:38,558
could that be tightened to

915
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:41,519
in any way and what would you see as an

916
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:44,000
acceptable rpd for potency

917
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,319
yeah fantastic question art i mean um

918
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,679
the rpd is super wide you know 30

919
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,439
percent

920
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,880
of course you don't know the expected

921
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,000
results of the

922
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,840
generally potency ones right and if it's

923
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,359
in a

924
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:00,079
uh pt

925
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,000
yeah pt are even wider they're 40

926
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,480
so you could pass them and you could

927
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,200
drive a truck through that um they will

928
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,360
have to tighten that in the lab i expect

929
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,960
around 10 but really i guess you work

930
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,319
around measurement uncertainty you have

931
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,200
to know what your measurement certainty

932
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,480
for your analytes are but yeah those do

933
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,919
need to be tightened because you can't

934
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,919
have 30

935
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,360
that wide and you can just you know it

936
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,000
could be anything and everybody will

937
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,719
pass regardless you know between 15 to

938
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,798
30 percent of expected number

939
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,600
that still passes so yes i expect that

940
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,359
will be tightened as well

941
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,379
all right thank you very much ladies and

942
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,558
gentlemen

943
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:40,640
[Applause]

944
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,639
you
