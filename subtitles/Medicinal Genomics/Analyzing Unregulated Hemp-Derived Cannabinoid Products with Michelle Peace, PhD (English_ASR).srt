University she has been funded by the

29
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:34,560
National Institute of Justice to study

30
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:37,559
the proliferation of semisynthetic THC

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,640
analoges in the unregulated market and

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,240
Define their relevant

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,159
biomarkers her work impacts public

34
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,078
health and Public Safety policies and

35
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,320
initiatives at caned 25 Michelle will

36
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,718
present why some people green out the

37
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,038
analysis of unregulated hemp derived

38
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:58,118
cannabis

39
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:01,079
products her team study uses a liquid

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:04,078
chromatography tandem spectrometry

41
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,319
method to analyze unregulated hemp

42
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,679
products and she found that all products

43
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,239
that they analized were mislabeled in

44
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,598
some way either misrepresenting the

45
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,759
cannabinoids contained therein or their

46
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,560
concentrations during our conversation

47
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,679
we discussed what has caused the rise of

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,280
semisynthetic cannabinoids in the

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,319
marketplace how Michelle got involved in

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,000
testing unregulated hemp and cannabis

51
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,639
products some of the Adverse Events that

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,159
have occurred from consuming

53
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,958
semi-synthetic

54
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,158
cannabinoids how the lsms method allows

55
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,319
Michelle's team to see compounds other

56
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:45,598
labs can't how consumers can protect

57
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,439
themselves from mislabeled products and

58
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,238
whether Federal legalization of cannabis

59
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,959
would eliminate the semisynthetic market

60
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,200
before we get to my conversation with

61
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,680

82
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:08,598
good afternoon Michelle thanks so much

83
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,200
for joining me on the podcast I know

84
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:12,878
thank you for having me Ben I'm really

85
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,318
excited for the conversation I'm excited

86
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,000
for the conversation and I'd like to say

87
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,519
that we're excited to have you as an

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,759
oral presenter at camed 25 we announced

89
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,639
the lineup just last week and I might be

90
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,520
biased here but I think it's one of the

91
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,400
strongest lineups we've ever had it's a

92
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,879
great mix of familiar names and new

93
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,918
faces and if I'm not mistaken you are a

94
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,680
new face have you attended a canmed

95
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,918
event before I haven't I'm really

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:45,199
excited to uh to be able to attend so

97
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:49,120
that I can learn from you know this this

98
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,840
side of the community um and also be a

99
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,319
part of the conversations about you know

100
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,799
how do we help consumers uh be safe and

101
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,959
still address health issues along the

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,759
way so um I'm really excited to be able

103
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,120
to attend and present so thank you

104
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,280
absolutely and I expect that your talk

105
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,840
is going to be well attended since it

106
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,319
covers a very Hot Topic in the industry

107
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,079
right now which is semisynthetic

108
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,240
cannabinoids or hemp derived

109
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,879
cannabinoids there's more than one

110
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,800
presentation touching on the topic and

111
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,360
we're also working on putting together a

112
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,160
panel discussion about it which I'm

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,919
hoping you can participate on as well so

114
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,800
per perhaps for those who aren't

115
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,240
familiar could you give us a quick

116
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,120
primer on the current situation with

117
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,079
semisynthetic or hemp derived canabo

118
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,160
what are they how are they made and why

119
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:45,478
are they seemingly everywhere these days

120
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,400
why are they everywhere yeah so um we

121
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,318
the hemp

122
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,560
derived semisynthetic compounds that we

123
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,039
see that are so popular in the

124
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,478
marketplace um we believe really was

125
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:02,680
given birth uh because of the explosion

126
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:07,639
of the production of

127
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:10,400
CBD and because H the CBD Marketplace

128
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,840
really reached Market

129
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:16,679
saturation um you of course it lost it

130
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:20,119
then lost value it's a it's a pretty

131
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,360
simple supply and demand uh business

132
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,000
model so to speak um and so when you're

133
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,879
not making as much money with that

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,959
product or you've got excess stores of

135
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:35,319
it sitting around that just gets harder

136
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:38,079
to um to sell then you know then we

137
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:41,720
believe that manufacturers thought about

138
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:45,719
well what can we do with what we have um

139
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,360
to then also push the marketplace

140
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,639
because the uh the

141
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:57,160
2018 Farm Bill the agricultural

142
00:06:51,639 --> 00:07:00,038
Improvement act um you know has a lot of

143
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:04,639
very broad language in it

144
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:07,120
and so um because of that broad language

145
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,918
uh it

146
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:15,879
manufacturers had the space to be able

147
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:19,279
to um produce these other compounds from

148
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:22,520
CBD uh and so through fairly

149
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:26,679
straightforward chemical processes you

150
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:30,279
can make an array of analogues that look

151
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:36,240
like CBD or t delta9

152
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:38,478
THC uh and and so you know there was the

153
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,560
scientific literature actually

154
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:44,000
explained how to do this how to um how

155
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,360
to make some of these uh chemical

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,680
reactions to make um other kinds of

157
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,720
cannabinoids uh and so um just slightly

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,918
tweaking some of those

159
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,879
foundational uh chemical reactions can

160
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:04,839
lead to an array of different products

161
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:09,000
uh and so what we wind up having now is

162
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:12,119
um there are you know places on that

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,839
molecular structure of tetrahydro

164
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,439
canaban uh that can be

165
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,638
modified and let's say that's three

166
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:26,279
different regions on that molecule well

167
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:29,720
if you've got you know um any any

168
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,278
Arrangement that is in those three areas

169
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,800
you you are going to be able to create

170
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,360
hundreds of different kinds of analoges

171
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,679
from that right because there's three

172
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,360
places that that molecule right now can

173
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,399
be modified so and modified easily so

174
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,200
you know so when you take a look at

175
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,120
those three areas and you modify each of

176
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,959
those sections you've got um uh an array

177
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,679
of compounds that can be manufactured

178
00:08:51,958 --> 00:09:00,759
from that uh and so because there is

179
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:05,159
looseness in the Farm building language

180
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:09,679
um and because uh there has been some

181
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:12,919
confusion as to what these compounds are

182
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:16,120
um from a regulatory perspective from a

183
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:18,679
legal perspective um that has just

184
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,799
allowed while we lay in that confusion

185
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,439
then the marketplace has just been able

186
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,599
to um be as creative as they possibly

187
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,839
can be nobody's really uh

188
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,480
monitoring the the um the quality of

189
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,920
these products so um so there's a lot of

190
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:41,800
space and when as a forensic scientist

191
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:46,159
what I know is that when there

192
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:49,639
is um space left in regulatory language

193
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,919
uh then nefarious activity will take

194
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:55,759
place you know and I'm not saying

195
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:58,399
everybody who has entered in this space

196
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:02,000
is has nefarious intentions I'm not

197
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:06,559
saying that there are certainly some

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,440
players in this industry who

199
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:14,719
are generating maybe quality

200
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:20,200
products uh for reasons to help

201
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:23,160
consumers um but at the end of the day I

202
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,800
still don't believe from my perspective

203
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,278
in the hundreds if not thousands of

204
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,958
products that we've

205
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,759
evaluated that we can still trust what

206
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,719
is in these

207
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,399
products so um so I think at the end of

208
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,879
the day you know I think that there's a

209
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,399
lot of Nefarious activity because you

210
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,519
know it's an easy way to make money uh

211
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,360
without

212
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,560
oversight right so now you mentioned the

213
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,278
broad language of the farm bill has sort

214
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,518
of opened the door for for this to

215
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:57,320
happen now if I understand correctly is

216
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:02,078
it the fact that it only specifies Delta

217
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:05,000
9 THC as being being sort of the um sort

218
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:07,039
of the band canav or or the one that's

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,799
um that determines whether it's it's

220
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:13,480
hemp or cannabis yeah I think that's

221
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:15,799
part of the problem certainly is uh you

222
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,560
know that at the time that the farm bill

223
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:23,519
was written you know there was just

224
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:27,199
concern about that singular compound uh

225
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,159
and it's placed in uh the dea's control

226
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,399
Substances Act on schedule one right uh

227
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:38,519
and so because that is the named

228
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:42,200
compound um then uh it's it's you you

229
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,720
there's place for other compounds to

230
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,440
exist right and so like you said you

231
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,440
have all these manufacturers or farmers

232
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,839
are sitting on this glut of CBD which

233
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,240
was really what seemed to be um the

234
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,320
intention of the farm bill was to kind

235
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,440
of you know create a Marketplace for CBD

236
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,360
D um which then got saturated and so

237
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,519
they had to get creative with how do we

238
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,399
turn this into a different compound or

239
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,120
well I would even say was that really

240
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:15,440
the intention of the farm bill probably

241
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,320
not the marketplace no the intention of

242
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:23,440
the farm bill was to allow people to

243
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:26,320
grow hemp and to grow hemp for non

244
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,279
pharmaceutical purposes right uh right

245
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,519
because you know I don't know from

246
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:36,039
t-shirts to bed sheets to animal betting

247
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,560
right so um you know so I think that was

248
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:41,278
the original intent of the of the

249
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,719
marketplace um you know we certainly

250
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,679
have seen Nationwide we definitely have

251
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,879
seen it here in Virginia where the

252
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:53,439
language was used in the process

253
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:57,240
of of of

254
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,760
Virginia wrestling with uh the Virginia

255
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,879
code and what are we what are we going

256
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:06,078
to um legalize or not how are we going

257
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,879
to do that you know there were

258
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,439
definitely lobbyists who got up and said

259
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,039
we want to do this because we're making

260
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,600
rope not dope and you know at the end of

261
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:19,159
the day everybody really knew that they

262
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,920
wanted to goow hemp to be able to

263
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:25,159
extract CBD from it so you know so I I

264
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:28,679
think that uh the intention of the farm

265
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:34,240
bill was to allow Farmers a pathway to

266
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:36,599
grow another kind of crop um and uh and

267
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,600
you know we need to close up those

268
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,360
loopholes excellent okay so I was hoping

269
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,759
you could you explain sort of what

270
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,519
motivated you to start studying these uh

271
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,720
these cannabinoids in these compounds

272
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:54,320
and their their implications yeah so um

273
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:56,519
there's actually um a long Arc to it uh

274
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,320
so I'm funded by the National Institute

275
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,799
of Justice I've been funded by them

276
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,360
since 200

277
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:06,919
14 uh to evaluate electronic cigarettes

278
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:11,600
and how they can be used and manipulated

279
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:15,559
to um Vape drugs other than

280
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,839
nicotine and you know I'll be honest we

281
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:22,719
always thought that THC and cannabis was

282
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,519
low hanging fruit we thought somebody's

283
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,160
going to do this we don't really need to

284
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:33,440
be in the space um we were really

285
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:36,240
concerned originally and still are about

286
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:41,160
people putting methamphetamine and

287
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,799
cocaine and fill and you know um their

288
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,958
anti-anxiety medication we were

289
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,879
concerned about how they were going to

290
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,159
use ecigarettes to bake those kinds of

291
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,720
compounds um and what implications it

292
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:57,198
had in the criminal justice system uh

293
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,920
and so what we really began monitoring

294
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:02,719
was the nature of the unregular Rel ated

295
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:06,799
nicotine ecigarette Marketplace so we

296
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,480
came uh we came to

297
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,078
really

298
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,680
um paint the picture of what was

299
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:16,399
happening in that unregulated space and

300
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,359
how it was creating problems for

301
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,679
consumers uh in addition to how do you

302
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,440
use them to vape other drugs and

303
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,799
somebody sent us

304
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,360
a um a

305
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:33,439
THC uh vape and they said surely this

306
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:41,199
isn't

307
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:43,759
THC so uh and it was labeled as 75% THC

308
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,439
something like that and when we analyzed

309
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,720
it it was really more like 40%

310
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,440
THC that's still a lot of

311
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,360
THC but we thought oh this is the same

312
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,560
thing is going to happen in the Cannabis

313
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,159
industry is what we're seeing in the

314
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,758
nicotine industry because we had

315
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:06,360
already published on and was

316
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,159
characterizing nicotine Vapes so the

317
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,240
unregulated ones you can't trust what's

318
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:14,480
on that package either in terms of the

319
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:18,959
nicotine concentration so that's really

320
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:22,319
what set us off to uh now we're now now

321
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,479
the industry has my attention right so

322
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:28,159
we started monitoring the quality of

323
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,440
those products and we saw sorry not not

324
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,120
to cut you off the these are the

325
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:39,160
unregulated products yeah unregulated

326
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:39,159
got it so we saw the Cannabis

327
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:49,318
industry use the consumers as their test

328
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:52,799
market for products so we saw the

329
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,759
chemical profiles of vaping products

330
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:59,359
evolve pretty

331
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:01,240
rapidly um and uh and then you know

332
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,278
we're watching the CBD Marketplace as

333
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,359
well and analyzing those products too

334
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:10,720
which also you couldn't trust the um the

335
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:14,599
quality of those products either and

336
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:19,000
then we received a a product from

337
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:22,480
somebody who said listen I can I I

338
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,640
consume a lot of canvas and this Vape is

339
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,838
not

340
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,880
canvis they sent it to us and we found a

341
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:32,159
really dangerous synthetic canavan oid

342
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,760
um five floro

343
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:40,679
ad and so we that was the moment we

344
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:44,160
realized Yep this nobody's monitoring

345
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:48,000
this it's not regulated um enforcement

346
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,840
is awful uh in the states that do have

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,839
regulations um so now the industry has

348
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:57,639
our full attention and uh and so we I

349
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,519
there was a pretty

350
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,840
public um

351
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:06,798
debate uh after we published that paper

352
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:11,000
where we found the five floro ADB in a

353
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,519
CBD product um that was marketed as safe

354
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,599
for

355
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:20,158
children and so we didn't re what was

356
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,639
the unintended consequence of that very

357
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:26,520
public debate right in the media

358
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:31,720
from uh the New York Times to Consumer

359
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:33,440
Reports AARP re etc etc um we started

360
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,279
receiving products from people who were

361
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,640
having Adverse Events from taking a

362
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:45,319
cannabis product so we started analyzing

363
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:47,679
those and realizing that um a that for a

364
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:50,279
certain period of time all of the

365
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,880
products were either mislabeled or

366
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:56,359
contained a synthetic

367
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:00,080
canav

368
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:02,918
so we're watching the CB Marketplace in

369
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,879
terms of you know what's happening with

370
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,520
this now over Supply that's being

371
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:14,640
generated

372
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:17,720
and uh we we saw the Delta 8 THC hit the

373
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,480
marketplace and we do a lot of

374
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,319
surveillance shopping and secret

375
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:28,400
shopping so I went into a

376
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:32,399
store uh to see if Delta 8 phc was in my

377
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,360
community commun and so I walked in and

378
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,559
there was a there was almost a line out

379
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:42,599
the door by Delta 8

380
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:45,678
THC and um in order to manage the crowd

381
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:48,519
uh the store clerk said we need you to

382
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:52,080
read this this document that was taped

383
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:54,519
to the display case and it had an

384
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:58,918
outright lie about the nature of delta8

385
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:01,279
on it and this say Delta 8 is like CBD h

386
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,200
and uh and I thought that's

387
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,119
fantastically dangerous uh and right

388
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,319
because it

389
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:13,599
underscores uh the ability of the

390
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:18,279
industry to outright lie about the

391
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:21,158
compounds so we started then uh

392
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:25,079
acquiring the Delta 8 products and then

393
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:27,600
we saw Delta 10 in the marketplace and

394
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,759
and 6A 10A so we started seeing some of

395
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:37,279
these and then I received a

396
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:39,200
case um that in which the consumer

397
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:43,079
had

398
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,679
such strong adverse event I mean

399
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,839
outright disassociation and

400
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:52,559
hallucinations and

401
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:54,959
paranoia that he committed a egregious

402
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:58,839
fing and now he's facing criminal

403
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:04,519
charges and life in prison

404
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:08,038
and uh and so uh the the I received the

405
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,158
product that he consumed and that's when

406
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:12,558
we

407
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:17,919
identified uh thco

408
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:21,240
acetate and then started seeing all of

409
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:26,600
the misinformation and disinformation

410
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:30,159
about phco acetate so now I am

411
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:33,959
fully I am fully committed now

412
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:39,278
to monitoring this emerging

413
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:41,038
Marketplace so um we are uh now funded

414
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:44,519
by the National Institute of

415
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:48,278
Justice to monitor the

416
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:52,759
marketplace develop methods to analyze

417
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:54,079
for all of the analoges that are in the

418
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,599
marketplace

419
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,359
currently and uh and then also assess

420
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,719
you know how do how

421
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:04,959
Prime labs and hospital clinical labs

422
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,159
and like for people who are having

423
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,319
Adverse Events you need to properly

424
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,720
attribute what that adverse event is to

425
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,359
so um so now and we do surveillance

426
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,360
shopping so that's why the ni has

427
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,399
currently funded us to specifically look

428
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,038
at these THC analoges and how they

429
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,360
penetrated different Market places um

430
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:28,759
and how do you analyze for them so

431
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:32,839
that's a long story as to how I got

432
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:36,480
invested but um but I think there are it

433
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:39,079
has points in there as to what happens

434
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,640
when nobody's

435
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:43,798
watching yeah for for sure and I did

436
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,799
want to ask you more sort of about these

437
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:47,400
Adverse Events that folks are

438
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,798
experiencing before they sort of reach

439
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,640
out or send those products to you uh for

440
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:56,319
analysis so you mentioned the

441
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,840
thco acetate as being one of the more

442
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,759
harmful cannabinoids as well so so me

443
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:04,359
you might be able to you know shed some

444
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:06,720
light on what are sort of the most uh

445
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:08,798
concerning of these canabo and what sort

446
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,120
of Adverse Events are they

447
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,119
producing um well so let's start with

448
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:19,038
the kinds of Adverse Events that we're

449
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:21,479
seeing um you know from a physiological

450
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,440
perspective you know from the point of

451
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,798
view from what's Happening to the body

452
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,278
and the body

453
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:32,759
organs um we're definitely seeing

454
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:38,400
you know um respiratory problems cardiac

455
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:40,119
problems um you know that are uh

456
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,080
certainly

457
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:45,038
disconcerting at best and

458
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:49,119
life-threatening at

459
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:53,119
worst um we from a this cognitive

460
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:58,639
behavioral perspective you know we see

461
00:23:53,119 --> 00:24:00,719
where um you know people are

462
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,880
they have extreme

463
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,798
paranoia um they are dissociating from

464
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,559
their body uh they're having severe

465
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:13,319
hallucinations um terrifying

466
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,519
hallucinations um so you know when you

467
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,839
take all of that into

468
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:22,000
consideration um you know these can be

469
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:27,439
life altering um you know we've

470
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:31,480
certainly had cases in my lab in which

471
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:34,399
the person is affected has been affected

472
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,640
after consuming one of

473
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:42,479
these years later are still having

474
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,520
significant problems had have had two

475
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,640
cases in in which somebody reported

476
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,519
having

477
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:54,038
seizures um you know there was one case

478
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:57,519
here in Richmond Virginia where um a uh

479
00:24:54,038 --> 00:25:00,759
somebody purchased a product and was at

480
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:04,079
an outdoor comp concert uh and had a

481
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:08,919
seizure uh and they had to stop the

482
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:13,119
concert and get her um medical attention

483
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:15,080
uh and took her to the hospital so um

484
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,199
you know and this was an unregulated

485
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:21,038
product that she purchased in a

486
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,919
shop and you know and you know to to

487
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:27,158
paint the you don't know what's going to

488
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:29,600
happen you know the claim was that that

489
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,840
same joint

490
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:34,558
was shared with two other

491
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,918
people and the other two people did not

492
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,558
have a

493
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:43,278
seizure so you know so this is part of

494
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:45,678
the difficulty with uh these compounds

495
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:50,640
so in terms of the adverse effects that

496
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,120
they can have W no and this is um I

497
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,038
guess to reiterate this is from the

498
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,079
unregulated market and largely

499
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,200
because

500
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:03,319
um the are people in in certain places

501
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,159
that do not have access to um Delta 9

502
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,240
THC because it's it's banned in that

503
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:10,799
state or or whatever so they're they're

504
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,880
looking for it elsewhere and are you

505
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,319
know kind of at the mercy of the the

506
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,760
actors who are are producing these

507
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,240
products absolutely I you know I think

508
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:24,640
some of the other challenge is that you

509
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,359
know we can't say that

510
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,799
um at with any certainty I would say we

511
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:36,158
can't say at all we can't even hint

512
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:40,480
to uh that this list of canono analoges

513
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,080
is more dangerous than this list um and

514
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,440
the the reason for that is that there is

515
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:47,199
very

516
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,960
little scientific research that has been

517
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,960
conducted on the safety or the efficacy

518
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,000
of of any of these

519
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,558
compounds uh and so you know that's

520
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,798
something of the challenge the other

521
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:03,839
challenge is that you can't you don't

522
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,000
know how much somebody is

523
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,319
consuming uh so that's the other

524
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,440
challenge in all of this is that you

525
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,759
can't believe how much the package says

526
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,399
that's in it and you don't know what the

527
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:19,359
list of compounds is that's in it right

528
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:22,239
so you know we have found that you know

529
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:24,519
there are some there are some products

530
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,640
that maybe list two compounds on the

531
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:29,918
package and contain seven compounds in

532
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,159
it well what's the accumulation of

533
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,520
effects from all of those compounds

534
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,159
right right and now I mean I obviously I

535
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:41,599
you you can't speak for the manufacturer

536
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,360
but do you think that that's intentional

537
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,759
in terms of you know they know that

538
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,158
there's these additional compounds or is

539
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,839
it just such a messy process to create

540
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,320
them that there are you know additional

541
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:55,079
compounds being created that you know

542
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:58,639
maybe weren't

543
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:00,158
intended I think it's both yeah

544
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,440
right

545
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,120
um yeah I think it's

546
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,600
good I think there are you know some

547
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,398
manufacturers that because nobody's

548
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:13,480
looking nobody's watching nobody's

549
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:15,518
enforcing anything honestly nobody's

550
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,399
analyzing the the products there's only

551
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:22,480
a handful of labs in the nation that are

552
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:28,199
able to analyze these these compounds my

553
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:32,440
lab is one of them uh and so uh when

554
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:36,880
when you can't even attribute you know

555
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:40,200
uh an event to a particular compound you

556
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,480
know then the conclusion usually winds

557
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,798
up being well it was a cannabis product

558
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,640
or it was it was a THC product when it

559
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:52,440
probably wasn't

560
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,320
or uh you know probably contain

561
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:59,240
something else or had way too much in it

562
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:02,038
write the list is this point right now

563
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,519
and now you mentioned um being able to

564
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:07,798
test for these and I know that you used

565
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,319
a specific technique for for this study

566
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:11,519
I was wondering if you could speak

567
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:13,839
briefly about kind of what that method

568
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:18,359
is and um why it was chosen for the

569
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:22,278
study sure so uh we use our primary

570
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:24,278
instrument for analysis is a liquid

571
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:29,319
chromatography with a tandem M

572
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:33,319
spectrometer attached to it um and

573
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:36,359
we use that instrument for uh almost

574
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:39,278
every analysis we do in my lab anyways

575
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,879
um and the reason for that is that uh

576
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:46,240
one it is very

577
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:49,159
sensitive uh right so when you've got um

578
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,319
analytes compounds that are in Trace

579
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,278
Amounts in products then you need to

580
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:57,359
have an instrument that's going to allow

581
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:59,839
you a really really low limit of

582
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,000
detection right meaning you can look at

583
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,678
things at very very low

584
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,798
concentrations so the lcms allows us to

585
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:12,919
do that the second reason why we use uh

586
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:16,639
the LC tandem aspect um is because we

587
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:19,240
can get uh we can

588
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,240
identify the

589
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:26,200
the molecule itself meaning the

590
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:30,159
molecular structure of a compound um so

591
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:33,360
right we break that compound into

592
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,640
fragments um and we analyze those and

593
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,879
then we break those fragments up again

594
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,600
and we analyze those and we can assemble

595
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,480
all of those fragments uh and uh

596
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:47,319
determine what the original chemical

597
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:51,960
structure is so for most of the canono

598
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:55,439
we're able uh to identify them that way

599
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,319
there are some of the canabo we can't so

600
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,558
um and that's just because uh you know

601
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,879
if you take a look at let's say Delta 8

602
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:06,638
and Delta 9

603
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,840
THC um you know those the difference

604
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:10,678
between those molecules is just a shift

605
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:14,678
in that double bond the location of that

606
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,159
double bond so for some of those we call

607
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,120
those isobars for some of those

608
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,600
compounds we can't tell the difference

609
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:25,278
between them so if that's the case then

610
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:29,599
we have another instrument that we use

611
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:32,038
uh that can separate them so so um so

612
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:36,119
the LC tandem MPC is our primary

613
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:38,000
instrument um and then we use a gcms as

614
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,239
a support instrument so that we can

615
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,200
determine you know what the exact um

616
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,599
cannaboid profile is in a

617
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,880
product and so how does that method or

618
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:53,240
technology compare to your standard

619
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,760
Cannabis Testing Lab well standard uh

620
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,720
Testing Lab uh is using uh what we call

621
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:02,278
an hlc

622
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:08,639
with um it's like a UV it's like a UV a

623
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:10,960
UV detector um it's a hplc dad or PDA um

624
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:15,638
it's a UV detector and so the challenge

625
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,000
with that detector uh is that you cannot

626
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:21,638
assess the the structure of the

627
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,880
molecular compound so that

628
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:28,199
detector um essentially absorbs energy

629
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,399
and emits energy from the comp compound

630
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,880
will absorb energy and emit energy and

631
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:36,398
you're able to um you know separate

632
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,320
those through the chromatography and so

633
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:42,038
because it's it doesn't give you any

634
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:45,519
kind of structural information then if

635
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:47,759
compounds are really similar then you

636
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,278
can't you can't really and they're

637
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,638
coming out at the same time you you

638
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:54,319
don't know that you have two compounds

639
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:57,278
in there you can't uh you can't

640
00:32:54,319 --> 00:33:00,480
ascertain what those are so at least

641
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:03,119
with the tandem aspect you know we're

642
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,399
able to determine the difference and so

643
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:09,759
I'll give you an

644
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:12,918
example so uh several years ago uh me

645
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:15,599
and several of my colleagues uh we

646
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,480
started a quality assurance testing lab

647
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:21,480
for the Cannabis industry here in

648
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,360
Virginia and um and we were uh you know

649
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,639
we were we were doing well we were you

650
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,798
this was our side hustle you know this

651
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:30,879
was a you know we're going to we're

652
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,519
going to build it we're going to be you

653
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,760
know uh you know we're going to be a

654
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,839
scientific voice in this and we're also

655
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:41,000
going because we're forensic scientists

656
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:43,158
we're going to use the instruments that

657
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,960
give us the best

658
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:49,120
information so that was going to be the

659
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,600
LC tandem ASPC to do potency testing

660
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,879
knowing that the rest of the industry

661
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:58,439
was using this this

662
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:02,639
hplc so um we had a client come to us

663
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:06,399
who had three different lab results for

664
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:08,960
the same product and they

665
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,319
were vastly different in and of

666
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,519
themselves those three results and they

667
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,559
said we don't know which one to believe

668
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:21,039
so when we ran the product it

669
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:23,559
was it it was light years different from

670
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:26,679
what is now the cluster of the original

671
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:29,960
Three and it was because that prod we

672
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:32,559
were able to see on the lcms we could

673
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,440
differentiate between Delta 8 and Delta

674
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:35,838
9

675
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,519
THC and the

676
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:43,679
hplc at the time you could not

677
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:48,199
differentiate it so right so we knew uh

678
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,519
early on in uh in the nature in the uh

679
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:53,838
in the emergence of these compounds that

680
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,800
lcms gave us the ability uh to

681
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,719
differentiate between the different

682
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,760
canono um and

683
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:07,319
uh but you know that also made us a um a

684
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:11,280
unique voice uh and so the industry was

685
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:14,880
not happy with us you know because you

686
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,720
know we came out very strong right

687
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,358
because remember that's a that's a a

688
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:23,319
for-profit laboratory my research

689
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:24,920
laboratory at the time is investigating

690
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,359
all of these emerging

691
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,680
analogues and so we're seeing not only

692
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:32,920
that the concentration of all these

693
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:34,799
analoges are not what's on the label and

694
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,119
that there's more of them in there we're

695
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,000
also finding residual solvents we're

696
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,680
also

697
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,079
finding uh contaminations like hair and

698
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:50,358
dirt in products we're you know High

699
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:54,240
microbiological counts um and so I came

700
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:58,119
out really really strongly against Delta

701
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:01,759
eight uh in Virginia uh when it first

702
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:03,119
emerged and as a result our business

703
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,240
dried

704
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:10,160
up so uh you know so we we had to

705
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:13,799
shutter the lab um you know I don't

706
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,920
regret it not one bit yeah right because

707
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,680
uh we always said we were going to stand

708
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:23,039
by the science we were going to stand by

709
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:26,838
quality and we took very seriously our

710
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:29,079
job to protect consumers absolutely no

711
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:31,000
and that's it's the way it should be so

712
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:34,160
for the example that you just mentioned

713
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,358
with the the producer who was getting

714
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,719
different results from the labs to took

715
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,039
it to you and you were able to kind of

716
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,959
see the difference between Delta 8 Delta

717
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,119
9 was that a flower

718
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,920
product uh no that was not a flower

719
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:49,318
product okay

720
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,119
yeah and okay because um yeah I was

721
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:53,880
going to be surprised because it was my

722
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,200
understanding that Delta 8 is made only

723
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,640
in very very Trace Amounts by the plant

724
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:03,679
itself correct but you know I'll be

725
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:07,358
honest uh we see uh we see that flower

726
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,399
products are sprayed with Delta eight so

727
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,598
you know it wouldn't have been

728
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,079
surprising that wouldn't have been a

729
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,318
surprising result even it even if it had

730
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,880
been a flower product but that wasn't a

731
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:19,480
flower product yeah and then the other

732
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,119
thing is you were mentioning or you know

733
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,159
one of the the key findings in your

734
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,160
study here is the mislabeling of the

735
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:30,078
different products um I was curious how

736
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:32,519
much of that do you think could be

737
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,039
attributed to the fact that folks are

738
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,559
using um different equipment than yours

739
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,400
and are not able to see sort of the the

740
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,920
differences um that you are able to see

741
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,838
yeah I think definitely some can be

742
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,800
attributed to that if you happen to have

743
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:50,199
somebody who is you know cares enough to

744
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:55,240
maybe send their product out for

745
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:58,039
analysis um then that's big

746
00:37:55,239 --> 00:38:00,318
F uh then the challenges going to be

747
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,039
that you there the lab is probably not

748
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:06,960
going to be able to analyze for all of

749
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:09,239
these analoges um but you know we don't

750
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,760
think the labs are act the manufacturers

751
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:14,719
actually sending these products out for

752
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,119
a real analysis yeah you know they're um

753
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:19,719
you know they're manufacturing the

754
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,559
certificates of analysis um we have one

755
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:24,000
product uh we received where you because

756
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,440
not only are we getting the products we

757
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
also go to the websites to see being

758
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,679
said about these compounds uh in these

759
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,960
products and so we have one product in

760
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:38,279
which the website literally

761
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:41,880
says guaranteed these compounds are in

762
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,480
this product but because the labs uh

763
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,920
can't analyze it we can't tell you how

764
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,920
much is in there but we promise it's in

765
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,920
there and it it

766
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:57,719
wasn't there was a bunch of other stuff

767
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,160
in there but uh you know so I mean

768
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:03,598
that's the landscape we live in so right

769
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:05,118
and I guess with that sort of you know

770
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,960
what are the implications of these

771
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,640
findings on sort of the the broader hemp

772
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,240
industry or even for consumers you know

773
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:16,639
what's sort of the the takeaway here

774
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:20,679
yeah so I I think there are

775
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:23,559
um a couple of implications here and and

776
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:25,159
again I mean I get it there are probably

777
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:29,078
some

778
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:31,279
um hemp manufacturer CBD manufacturers

779
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,839
analog manufacturers whatever they're

780
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,160
calling themselves you know who might

781
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:43,078
care and uh

782
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:45,960
and have the intention of creating these

783
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,519
products for consumers who don't have

784
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,720
access to Delta 9

785
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:54,000
THC um uh in their

786
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:59,279
states

787
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:03,239
but they are still comp licit

788
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,280
in the Adverse Events that people are

789
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:12,759
experiencing right you have an industry

790
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:17,160
that uh is so far not been held

791
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:19,800
accountable for people dying for people

792
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:22,480
having s significant Adverse Events that

793
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,280
have affected their lives for

794
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,358
years uh you know so I think that's some

795
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,599
of the problem with um you know the the

796
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,759
lack of oversight and and of course some

797
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,880
of that is an it's an analytical problem

798
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,440
right because there's not many Labs that

799
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,838
can actually analyze these I think it

800
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,760
complicates from a state perspective and

801
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:47,679
even the federal perspective I think it

802
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,480
complicates

803
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:54,078
the the state of

804
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:57,960
legalization uh and you know

805
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,960
because uh most of the Adverse Events

806
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,079
are not being adequately

807
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,400
attributed right so we don't

808
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:13,440
know if the product they consumed was

809
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:16,559
just 10 times the the THC concentration

810
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,800
or contained seven or eight analoges we

811
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:21,639
don't know that but usually what gets

812
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,960
reported is that it was a canabo product

813
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:27,639
or it was a THC product and you know and

814
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,800
so when an adverse event gets attacked

815
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:36,598
to well it was a THC product you know

816
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:39,440
then that becomes difficult language to

817
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:41,400
ignore um and so right so we need to be

818
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,920
able to uh from a public health and

819
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,800
Public Safety perspective be able to

820
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,159
properly attribute uh the Adverse Events

821
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,318
so I think you know those are a couple

822
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:57,440
of the bigger impacts of having an

823
00:41:53,318 --> 00:42:00,000
unregulated uh hemp industry

824
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,800
yeah no and then there is sort of

825
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,318
another side of sort of the hemp

826
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,720
industry too where there are some

827
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:10,079
manufacturers I know who are producing

828
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,559
not analoges or semi- synthetic but you

829
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,960
know

830
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:18,239
THC Delta 9thc but in what they what

831
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:22,838
they interpret as a low enough

832
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:25,439
concentration to be deemed hemp

833
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:28,159
yes

834
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,079
correct and

835
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:33,799
I we've analyzed some of those compound

836
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,318
those products okay

837
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,240
and

838
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:44,119
in almost 100% of the products we've

839
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:48,558
analyzed they contain over that 0.3%

840
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:52,160
THC Absolut so what is a consumer to do

841
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:54,960
um just say no now I think it's buy or

842
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:59,318
beware right I think the first thing is

843
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,880
is is um is the consumer has to realize

844
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:06,318
that if it's if they are purchasing a

845
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:10,079
product in an unregulated market right

846
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:14,279
um meaning that you are buying it at a

847
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:18,800
smoke and vape shop or right or online

848
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:22,240
online if you are in a convenience store

849
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,880
um that just because it's in the

850
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,159
marketplace doesn't mean that it's safe

851
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,920
right we have

852
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:33,679
um

853
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,000
we as a culture believe that well surely

854
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:40,719
if it's in the if if it's in a store and

855
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,519
I can buy it in a store then somebody

856
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:47,159
has said this is safe and reasonable for

857
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:48,679
me to consume and so they don't really

858
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,078
appreciate the difference between

859
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:54,759
unregulated and regulated marketplaces

860
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:57,880
necessarily so I would say that for all

861
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:01,640
consumers is that you should should

862
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:06,039
despite the taxes purchase your products

863
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:10,118
in a regulated Marketplace MH um I think

864
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:13,679
that is the safest path forward for

865
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:15,000
consumers and I get it that some people

866
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,759
have said well we don't want to pay the

867
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,119
taxes and the taxes are too high and I

868
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,640
just read a a a scientifically published

869
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,559
manuscript recently that said that well

870
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,920
consumers really don't care about the

871
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:29,839
high PR

872
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,800
they care about how much product they

873
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:35,279
can buy for a price

874
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,920
point that's a very important

875
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,040
distinction

876
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:45,039
so needless to say I think that it is um

877
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:47,440
important for consumers to be very

878
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:52,079
cautious about what they're hearing

879
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:55,119
about all of these analoges um and uh

880
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:58,240
and the quality of the products and the

881
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,720
safest the safest place for them to

882
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,439
purchase their products is going to be

883
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:02,759
inside of the regulated Marketplace

884
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,358
despite some of the challenges in the

885
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,720
regulated marketplace right and where

886
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:12,799
that's available right sure so hard in

887
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:16,558
in states that haven't that don't have a

888
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,880
uh regul legal regulated Marketplace um

889
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:23,040
it's hard for the consumer right

890
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,960
so or has created hurdles right so I

891
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:28,920
mean how hard is it going to be for some

892
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:32,639
people to actually get you know their um

893
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:36,000
their note uh saying that they can have

894
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:38,199
medical marijuana you know so um so I

895
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,480
think states have to think about that if

896
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:46,039
they really care about you know consumer

897
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,559
safety uh then they have to make it

898
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:51,880
easier for

899
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:55,119
consumers to acquire regulated products

900
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,160
right yeah I mean it seems like and of

901
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,280
course this might be a bit up istic but

902
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,440
you know if cannabis were federally

903
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,319
legal and

904
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,760
regulated seems like a lot of these

905
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:09,400
issues go

906
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,280
away yeah they're not I'll be honest

907
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,079
they're not really all going away I I

908
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,280
get asked this question a lot in terms

909
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,079
of and from a lot of of state

910
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,760
legislators is like well if we if we

911
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,480
create a

912
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,040
regulated uh

913
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,079
Marketplace uh then all of this stuff is

914
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:31,039
is going to disappear right and I'm no

915
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:33,240
it is never completely going to go away

916
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:36,199
because there's there's always going to

917
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,959
be a Marketplace for people looking for

918
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:41,480
alternative

919
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:45,039
experiences no matter what the drug is

920
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:48,119
right so so this is I think some of the

921
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:50,318
challenge will it it won't all go away a

922
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:53,640
lot will go away right

923
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:56,599
because you know you've got a lot of

924
00:46:53,639 --> 00:47:00,199
consumers whether they're cannabis naive

925
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:04,318
or are in pain or whatever

926
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:06,879
who or just want to experience it and uh

927
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,400
and they're and and so just for those

928
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,838
kinds of consumers you know you got to

929
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:16,639
create a pathway for them but I think

930
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:20,440
for the nefarious the really nefarious

931
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:23,318
types um there's always going to be

932
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,720
Marketplace well Michelle this is a this

933
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:27,039
is a fascinating topic I think we could

934
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:29,919
we could probably do a whole another

935
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,920
hour but we'll we'll save it for canmed

936
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,800
and folks should definitely come out and

937
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,358
uh continue the conversation um but

938
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,160
before I let you go I did want to give

939
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:41,000
you an opportunity to share any um

940
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:42,399
additional resources that you think that

941
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,400
folks who are listening who want to

942
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,480
maybe read up more uh might be

943
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,960
interested in and then of course where

944
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:54,079
they can find you and your work as well

945
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:56,880
sure um I have uh so we're building out

946
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:01,000
a web page for the lab uh that's going

947
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:04,920
going to have links to our uh

948
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,838
manuscripts um and we're also developing

949
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,480
some um documents right because a lot of

950
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:12,119
like School administrators like don't

951
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,440
know they they don't know and they're

952
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:17,400
trying to protect the children in their

953
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,838
marketplaces and so we're generating uh

954
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:24,119
products uh like reading materials um

955
00:48:20,838 --> 00:48:26,440
one page reports uh that are easy to

956
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:29,240
digest uh with that information so I'm

957
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,559
happy to share with you uh the link to

958
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:33,679
that and links to the manuscripts that

959
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:35,440
people might be interested in Reading

960
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,239
excellent yeah if yeah send the links

961
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,119
I'll put them in the show description so

962
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:41,199
it's easy for folks who are listening to

963
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,318
to check that out right all right

964
