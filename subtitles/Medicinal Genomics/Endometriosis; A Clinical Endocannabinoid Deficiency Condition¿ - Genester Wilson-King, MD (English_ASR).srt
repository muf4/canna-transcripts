00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:08,919
good morning good morning good morning I

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,679
am excited and honored to be here and I

3
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:15,439
want to thank the canmed

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:19,480
2024 crew for all their work and putting

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:22,879
on this wonderful event and what a

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,359
wealth of information that we've

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:28,960
received these past few days I'm really

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,080
really overwhelmed so thank you all very

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,399
much

10
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,640
now if somebody will tell me how to work

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,640
these

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,039
things we should have been

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,160
oriented I see it I see

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,159
it there we

15
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:02,279
go good good good thank you

16
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,759
um I have no Financial commitments

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,359
conflicts to

18
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,920
declare and the objectives of my talk

19
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,280
the talk is entitled cannabis and

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,719
endometriosis a potential treatment I

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,439
will describe endometriosis and its

22
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,438
clinical picture we'll look at its

23
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:23,319
ideology and current the current

24
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:27,559
treatment options then we'll examine how

25
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:31,719
cannabis seems uniquely suited to treat

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,719
the many aspects of endometriosis

27
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,239
and may be a promising treatment I do

28
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,000
have a case study and I hope that I can

29
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,959
get to it I'm going to really go through

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,879
this

31
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,478
quickly uh one more item we no longer

32
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:50,000
live in a binary world my intent is to

33
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:52,560
use inclusive language though yes I

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,159
might slip up but when describing

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
research findings this discussion will

36
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,799
use the gender terminology in the

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,439
research that the researchers used

38
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,039
so what is endometriosis endometriosis

39
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,840
is defined as the presence of

40
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,239
functioning endometrial like tissue

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,439
outside of the

42
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,560
uterus normally the lining of the uterus

43
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:22,079
is where the uh endometrial tissue is

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,120
but when it's displaced or mislocated it

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,239
is called

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,599
endometriosis the and it's also

47
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,680
accompanied with a chronic inflammatory

48
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:33,639
reaction now the prevalence of

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,080
endometriosis is about 10 to

50
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:41,598
15% in the US about 6 and A5 million

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:45,319
women alone uh have endometriosis the

52
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:48,759
economic burden is impactful it exceeds

53
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:51,000
2 excuse me$ 22 billion doll in the us

54
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:54,399
alone and when you look at it compared

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,479
to diabetes it is more costly than

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,760
diabetes true prevalence though is

57
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,639
unknown mainly due to the fact fact that

58
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,158
there's an inherent bias among

59
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,919
clinicians regarding endometriosis

60
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:11,199
existing in anyone other than white

61
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,399
females of reproductive age which was

62
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,639
clearly stated in textbooks until the

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,959
late 80s in textbooks in

64
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,839
Gynecology other groups have been found

65
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,158
to have

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,840
endometriosis including

67
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,519
adolescence

68
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,438
postmenopausal people people of color

69
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,640
and transgender male

70
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:36,799
there are actual studies looking at

71
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:39,000
transgender males and the rate of

72
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,519
endometriosis there's other factors

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,919
including the recognition of

74
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:47,840
endometriosis in is inadequate and the

75
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,438
diagnosis time ranges from 4 to 11 years

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,400
with

77
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:57,318
65% of people being

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,480
misdiagnosed initially and some we don't

79
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:00,479
know how many because they were never

80
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,158
done

81
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,639
diagnosed so what is the

82
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,479
ideology we don't really know the exact

83
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,518
ideology there have been many theories

84
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:13,679
presented but it's becoming more and

85
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,239
more evident that physiologic genetic

86
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,918
environmental factors and immunologic

87
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,959
dysfunction are uh play large roles in

88
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,519
the

89
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,040
ideology now we used to think that

90
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,879
endometriosis was a disease limited to

91
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:33,080
the pelvis it is not it is a systemic

92
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:37,120
disease there was a review in the Lancet

93
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:40,038
by Hugh Taylor uh at Yale re Yale School

94
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,918
of Medicine endometriosis is now

95
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:44,839
considered a systemic disease rather

96
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,959
than the disease predominantly affecting

97
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,478
the

98
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,159
pelvis they this review has dis

99
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:52,680
illuminated the fact that we've

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,080
discovered that

101
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,879
endometriosis affects metabolism in the

102
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,399
liver at uh leads to systemic

103
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:05,159
inflammation and and Alters gene

104
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:07,560
expression in the brain leading to pain

105
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,520
hypersensitization and mood disorders

106
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,120
which are both very common in affected

107
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,319
patients there's some key factors that

108
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,759
are important in the systemic presence

109
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,199
of the disease there's pro-inflammatory

110
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,800
cyto kindes and shifts in circulating

111
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,520
immune cell populations that cause

112
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,600
inflammation outside of the pelvis

113
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,719
circulating micro EMP excuse me

114
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,199
micrornas have been found in abundance

115
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,560
and these can locally modulate gene

116
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,038
expression to throughout the body data

117
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,319
from animal models show that cells from

118
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,240
endometriotic lesions can migrate into

119
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:51,439
other organs including lungs liver

120
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,960
spleen and brain and I've actually seen

121
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,399
endometriosis uh in a lung in the lungs

122
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,079
the

123
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,560
the a different department was were

124
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,599
doing a bio biopsy of a mass in the lung

125
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,038
of a

126
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,879
35-year-old female and it turned out to

127
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:12,279
be endometriosis and endometrioma and I

128
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,159
was consulted on it this was a few years

129
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,959
ago uh patients with endometriosis have

130
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,080
been shown to have

131
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,318
alterations excuse me in cardiovascular

132
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,359
neurological metabolic and immune

133
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,598
function for example and an analysis of

134
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,680
the nurse's health study 2 done between

135
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:34,478
1998 in

136
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,519
2009 showed that women with surgically

137
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,560
confirmed endometriosis had a

138
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,000
statistically uh significant greater

139
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,000
risk of cardiovascular disease than

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,279
women without endometriosis

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,360
endometriosis is a disease that is is a

142
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,719
disease of contrast is the way I like to

143
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,560
put it it's benign but it is invasive

144
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,360
and can have distant

145
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,280
metastasis we've really just begun to

146
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,038
discover the uh

147
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,000
extent or scope of this disease now

148
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,079
here's another study this is pretty

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,079
recent actually was uh published in

150
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:15,318
November of last year W in which it's a

151
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,240
study that suggests another possible

152
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,439
contributing factor to the ideology or

153
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,918
part of the pathophysiology or the

154
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,839
result of endometriosis and it looked at

155
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,560
the endocannabinoid

156
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,198
system and the

157
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,959
microbiome and how it can influence

158
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,240
endometriosis the endoc abinoid system

159
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,878
regulating

160
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,800
inflammation and pain perception and the

161
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:43,560
microbiome influencing immune responses

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,038
and hormonal balance an unhealthy gut

163
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,319
now this is really important because

164
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,478
actually I've run into this clinically

165
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,720
more often than you would think an

166
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,878
unhealthy gut called disbiosis

167
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,440
is uh can create an enzyme called beta

168
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,960
glucuronidase and beta

169
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,839
glucuronidase reactivates estradiol and

170
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,799
causes it to recirculate mimicing

171
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,399
mimicking higher estrogen levels making

172
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,759
women seem like they're estrogen

173
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,839
dominant when they really aren't it's

174
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:17,199
just recirculating of the estrogen um

175
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,560
there's evidence that a

176
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,800
disregulation of the endocrin abinoid

177
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,360
system and the gut influence

178
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,199
endometriosis symptoms and progression

179
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,639
via changes in CB1 receptor expression

180
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,519
and changes in circulating levels of the

181
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,158
endoc

182
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,158
canabo more research is definitely

183
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:42,360
needed what are the symptoms of

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,480
endometriosis well disys Menara is the

185
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,360
most common symptom it affects at least

186
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,399
70% of the uh patients but this is

187
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,000
Progressive and worsening disys Menara

188
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,679
and pain at non-menstrual times of the

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,639
month rather than the common menstrual

190
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,120
menstrual cramps

191
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,919
infertility is also very very important

192
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,959
in fact many patients aren't diagnosed

193
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,679
with endometriosis until they undergo

194
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:12,559
infertility

195
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,479
evaluations approximately up to 50% of

196
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,479
women with infertility are diagnosed

197
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,440
with endometriosis then there's

198
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,200
something called Endo belly which

199
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:26,519
actually relates to the um to the gut

200
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,800
disbiosis that is part of the process

201
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,839
but Endo belly is bloating constipation

202
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,319
diarrhea and really can be quite

203
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,560
disruptive so endometriosis really

204
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,360
significantly affects the patients

205
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,319
physiological mental and psychological

206
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,519
health and their social and economic

207
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,800
participation many patients are on

208
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,839
anti-depressants anti- anxiety and even

209
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,958
antis psychotic meds if you go around go

210
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,720
to from Doctor to doctor complaining of

211
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,278
pain and everyone tells you there's

212
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,600
nothing wrong you will be on antis

213
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,000
psychotics too

214
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,839
uh it also significantly affects the

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,159
families partners and carers of patients

216
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,920
with these disease these

217
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,919
diseases what are the treatment options

218
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,879
well that's a

219
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:21,039
problem the main factors to consider in

220
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,480
treatment uh is whether how severe the

221
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,679
signs and symptoms are and whether or

222
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,839
not the patient wants to be become

223
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:30,199
pregnant uh medical and surgical

224
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,880
intervention

225
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,000
interventions

226
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:36,679
are comparable cause comparable pain

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,200
relief

228
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:43,078
44% pain recurrence after medical

229
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,560
treatment and 55 53% pain recurrence

230
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:46,879
after surgical

231
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,799
treatment conventional treatment is

232
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:53,278
mediocre at best and there's

233
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:56,078
insufficient evidence on the efficacy of

234
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,320
any specific medication for relieving

235
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,679
pain associated with endometriosis so

236
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,320
the best treat treatment for

237
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:06,000
endometriosis is something that will

238
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,519
relieve the pain treat the other

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,480
symptoms of endometriosis and not

240
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,039
adversely affect

241
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,200
fertility this is where cannabis Can Be

242
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,838
an Effective uh treatment and far

243
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,639
superior to what we even have

244
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:25,800
now so potential for cannabis well we'll

245
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,839
start with the endoc canabo system the

246
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,319
master regulator of the body using Dr

247
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,519
Russo

248
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,639
term specifically we're going to talk

249
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,560
about the theory of clinical endoc

250
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,480
canabo deficien deficiency which

251
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,879
suggests that in some cases the body

252
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,839
doesn't produce enough endoc canabo or

253
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:48,200
enough receptors for the endoc canabo

254
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,760
system to function as a result it means

255
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,639
the many functions in which the uh

256
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,240
endocan aoid system is involved aren't

257
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,079
regulated properly it was proposed by Dr

258
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,278
Ethan Russo in 2008 and then

259
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,879
reconsidered in 20

260
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,799
2016 um you may think after these next

261
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,399
couple slides that I'm here just really

262
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:11,599
Ling Dr Russo with a lot of Praise but

263
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,440
he deserves it it's just that these

264
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,639
happen to be quite important in talking

265
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,279
about

266
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,278
endometriosis um there are four tenants

267
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,480
to conditions to qualify as as a

268
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:25,320
clinical endocrine ammonoid deficiency

269
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,680
condition the first is an increased

270
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,560
sensitivity to pain called hyperalgesia

271
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,838
now people with endometriosis are

272
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:37,000
commonly hyper sensitive to pain due to

273
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,600
central pain sensitization the micro

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,198
rnas lead to changes in the

275
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,399
electrophysiologic activity and the gene

276
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,000
expression in the regions of the brain

277
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,639
associated with pain

278
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,240
perception that seems to be the cause as

279
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,320
illuminated by Taylor at all in 2021

280
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,360
secondly all the conditions are usually

281
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,360
diagnosed subjectively by a process of

282
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,800
exclusion there being no uh objective

283
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,919
tissue or lab findings diagnostic for

284
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:11,359
any one of them endometriosis does not

285
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:13,958
have a pathom monic signs or symptom

286
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,278
that are specific for the disease mainly

287
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:20,198
the disease uh has symptoms that are

288
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:21,720
common to other GYN or even some non-gyn

289
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:24,039
disorders such as

290
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,079
fibromyalgia third all are associated

291
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:30,879
with a higher incident instance of

292
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:34,078
anxiety and depression again

293
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,679
probably via the micrornas causing

294
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,838
changes in the electrophysical activity

295
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:42,198
ande expression the in the regions of

296
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,560
the brain associated with anxiety and

297
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:46,399
depression as mentioned earlier and

298
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,000
finally number four these conditions

299
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:53,600
often overlap with some combination of

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,198
similar conditions such as PS PTSD Ms

301
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,680
autism

302
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:02,240
Etc this I'm just at this point going

303
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:05,159
through few scientific studies that will

304
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,000
that show the potential for cannabis

305
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,319
being a treatment for

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,480
endometriosis this next

307
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,560
study Dr Russo 2011 taming THC it's

308
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,320
probably a paper most of you have read

309
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,958
if not should read because it really was

310
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,839
um is very important it's a review that

311
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,319
explored the canab the Cannabis

312
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,680
terpenoids uh and focused on phyto

313
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,680
canabo turpenoid interactions that could

314
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,758
produce Synergy with respect to

315
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,479
treatment of pain inflammation

316
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,919
depression and anxiety those four

317
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,240
symptoms I just that mentioned are

318
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,879
components of

319
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,360
endometriosis the a few earlier studies

320
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:51,838
demonstrated and Dr Russo talked about

321
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,480
this a little earlier um that gpr18

322
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,279
stimulation was found to caused

323
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,920
migration of cells then a couple of

324
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:03,480
years later uh was this was shown to

325
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:08,360
cause migration of endometrial cells

326
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:12,079
well CBD is a GPR antagonist it can stop

327
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,519
the migration well potentially can stop

328
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:18,159
the migration of endometrial cells

329
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,360
making a a potential prevention and

330
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,319
treatment of

331
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,320
endometriosis this next study was a a

332
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,800
clinical

333
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,800
study in persons with and without

334
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:35,639
chronic pelvic pain had 49 people

335
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:37,559
21 uh 49 people underw end uh with

336
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,680
endometriosis confirmed underwent

337
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:44,119
laparoscopy again 28 had chronic pelvic

338
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:47,198
pain 21 did not samples were taken from

339
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,159
the peritoneum of both and it revealed

340
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:53,838
that the people with chronic pelvic pain

341
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,919
had more trpv1 immunoactivity when

342
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,279
compared to the people without chronic

343
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,360
pelvic

344
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:03,078
pain the study show showed that trpv1

345
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,600
expression in parital endometrial fosi

346
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:10,159
related to Chronic pelvic pain uh and a

347
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,480
subsequent study found that CBD

348
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:16,958
stimulates and desensitizes trpv1

349
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,199
leading to less

350
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,679
pain this next was a review study

351
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:24,958
looking directly at CBD for the

352
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:28,198
management of endometriosis and chronic

353
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:31,078
pelvic pain it's most of the studies in

354
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:33,479
this review are

355
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,278
preclinical uh and preclinic these

356
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,240
Studies have shown that

357
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,838
CBD decreases the secretion of

358
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,720
pro-inflammatory cyto cons in uh

359
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,519
including inter Lucan 6 and Tor necrosis

360
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,000
Factor Alpha and can increase the levels

361
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:54,120
of anti-inflammatory cyto kindes also

362
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,639
the angiolytic antidepressant

363
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,000
neuroprotective and mood stabilizing and

364
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,278
sleep modulating effects of canabo in

365
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,798
general may be very useful in the

366
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:06,519
management of the

367
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:08,639
nonphysical symptoms frequent among

368
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:12,519
patients with

369
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:17,160
endometriosis now we can't leave THC out

370
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:21,038
completely so this next study was uh a

371
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:24,279
mouse uh a mouse model was created by a

372
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:26,919
group of researchers to mimic some of

373
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:29,519
the conditions in human

374
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:32,360
endometriosis these include pelvic pain

375
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:35,319
anxiety and cognitive deficits the mice

376
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:40,279
were treated with 2 milligrams per kilo

377
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:43,759
of Delta 9 THC daily for 28 days the THC

378
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:47,558
was given via subcutaneous injections

379
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:50,759
now that's not how we ingest

380
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:54,359
THC but keep

381
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:57,519
following they the mice were treated and

382
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,798
they found that THC reduced pelvic pain

383
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,720
and cognitive impairments in the mice

384
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:06,200
but it had no effect on their anxious

385
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:11,159
Behavior remember they were only using

386
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:13,440
THC THC May ALS also seem to inhibit the

387
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,840
growth of and development of the

388
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,360
endometriotic implants implants now

389
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:21,639
remember as many have said preclinical

390
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,279
studies may not trans translate to The

391
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,919
Human Experience but this is important

392
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:30,038
information here's a picture of the

393
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,559
pre-c treatment and and post THC

394
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:34,319
treatment of the endometriotic implant

395
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,200
of one of

396
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:43,200
them now since

397
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,440
we we like to use whole um whole plant

398
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,120
uh artisian formulas we can't leave the

399
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,519
Turpin out beta corene causes regression

400
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:55,759
of endometrial implants in a rat model

401
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:58,839
this study looked at beta coring and

402
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,960
again they used adult female rats and

403
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:02,759
MIM mimicked

404
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,558
endometriosis fragments of the

405
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,839
endometrium were implanted in the

406
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,240
parital cavity of the adult rats they

407
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:13,240
watched them grow over a 4-we period and

408
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,880
then treatment started with beta copling

409
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:20,359
10 milligrams per kilo they also used 30

410
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,440
milligrams per kilo for 21 days and the

411
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,599
growth was of the endometriotic implants

412
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,759
were measured again there was also a

413
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:31,519
control group the beta Carlene 10 migs

414
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:35,400
per kilo suppressed the growth of

415
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:38,960
endometriotic implants by

416
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,080
52.5% the 30 milligram per kilo did not

417
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,519
do as well was only about

418
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:50,918
30% beta coring that that follows along

419
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:52,319
with less is more uh beta Kling also

420
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,759
produced

421
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:58,720
apoptosis more cell death and also just

422
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,879
as important there was no statistically

423
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,000
significant difference observed in the

424
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,039
fertility of the rats that were treated

425
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,960
with beta crawling and that were not in

426
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:13,240
terms of fertility that's really what

427
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,200
you want in treating endometriosis you

428
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,319
don't want to interfere with fertility

429
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,919
because that really does guide treatment

430
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:22,200
so beta coring was an effective putative

431
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,799
treatment now let's summarize some of

432
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,200
this data because I'm moving along here

433
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,279
gpr18 may play a role in cellular

434
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,038
migration

435
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,279
it appears to specifically induce

436
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:36,440
endometrial

437
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:39,319
migration CBD is a gpr18 antagonist

438
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:43,880
trpv1 is related to Chronic pelvic pain

439
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:45,519
in women CBD stimulates and desensitizes

440
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,600
trpv1

441
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,240
endometriosis appears to be associated

442
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,038
with a down regulation of CB1 and CB2

443
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,960
receptors and up regulation of

444
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,640
trpv1 endometriosis also appears to be

445
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,519
Associated excuse me can cannabinoid

446
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,200
Agonist can potentially inhibit

447
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:06,279
endometriotic cell proliferation THC and

448
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,400
beta corene seem to be effective

449
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:11,119
putative

450
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,798
agents please note that whole plant

451
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:17,719
cannabis can reduce pain by interacting

452
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:22,079
with a wide range of canabo opioid

453
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:25,400
vanilloid serot serotonergic and

454
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:28,278
anti-inflammatory receptors as the

455
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,080
illustrious Dustin sulac pointed out in

456
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:33,240
a few of his

457
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:36,678
talks people with endometriosis are

458
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,440
using cannabis and finding relief so we

459
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:43,559
need to pay attention to that oh and I

460
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,558
do have time to do the case study

461
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:51,960
awesome this is

462
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:55,319
a well I have on my nose 44 but 42 on

463
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,038
the slide she was in her 40s early 40s

464
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,278
um diagnosed with endometriosis who had

465
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,240
a long history of chronic pelvic pain

466
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,359
pain with intercourse and anxiety and

467
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,519
depression and she had been going along

468
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:10,119
for a few years she had she went through

469
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,079
medical and surgical interventions and

470
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:15,879
really did well for a short period of

471
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:18,558
time but when she entered her 40s things

472
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,440
worsened she started to De develop sleep

473
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:24,678
issues moodiness and increasing pelvic

474
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,919
pain and pain with intercourse and it

475
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,200
was really starting to impact her

476
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,640
marriage

477
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
we checked her hormone levels because

478
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,440
women in their

479
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:40,200
40s are if usually per menopausal or

480
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,720
certainly almost there they you start

481
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,200
women start to lose progesterone

482
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,319
first and when

483
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,000
you main reason is as the ovaries start

484
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:55,439
to decrease their production of

485
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,240
hormones testosterone also comes from

486
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,400
not just the ovaries but it also comes

487
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,960
from the adrenal gland it can be

488
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,120
produced from DHEA estradiol also can

489
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,079
produced is not just produced in the

490
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,278
ovary it's produced in fat cells and is

491
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,798
produced by the adrenal gland

492
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,839
progesterone only comes from the ovary

493
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:17,079
so when the ovaries start to decline and

494
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:21,480
function progesterone is the first

495
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:25,399
hormone to decrease and that makes a p a

496
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:29,038
woman estrogen dominant so it can

497
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,798
certainly reactivate so to speak the

498
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,558
endometrial

499
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:36,480
implants we added progesterone to her

500
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:39,519
regimen initially um and this helped her

501
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,079
with sleep and mood stabilization but it

502
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,960
didn't help with the endometriosis now

503
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,720
in most patients I should say many

504
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,000
patients maybe two-thirds of patients

505
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,880
progesterone does really offer a

506
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,720
tremendous help because it Balan the

507
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,080
effect balances out the effects of

508
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:01,319
estrogen but onethird of patients with

509
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:04,639
endometriosis are progesterone

510
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,918
resistant unknown ideology of that also

511
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,320
abnormal progesterone signaling chronic

512
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,640
inflammation aberant gene expression all

513
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:15,319
can be causes but progesterone

514
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,278
resistance lead leads to you can't

515
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:21,240
counteract the effects the estrogen

516
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:26,319
dominance going on so one of the things

517
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:30,000
we did is she was uh we implemented a

518
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:33,599
healthier lifestyle modif her diet and

519
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,640
she lost 20 lbs over time why is weight

520
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,678
loss important it's important because ma

521
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,640
in the management of of patients is

522
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:42,519
because fat cells contain estrogen the

523
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,278
more fat cells you have around the more

524
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:49,639
estrogen you have and and also adpost

525
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,359
tissue causes chronic inflammation as

526
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,480
well

527
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:58,719
so maintaining a a a good weight is also

528
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,880
very important we counsel patients about

529
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,960
eating in our office we C counsel

530
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,039
patients about eating real food

531
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,440
following an anti-inflammatory diet

532
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:10,000
avoiding toxins chemicals artificial

533
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,679
sweeteners Etc things actually we all

534
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,278
should be doing we also encourage foods

535
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,360
that can encourage the healthy

536
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,558
metabolism of estrogen because that's

537
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,839
very important as well these foods are

538
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,918
actually the cruciferous vegetables they

539
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:27,639
contain a product called 33 diol

540
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:31,200
methane which has been shown to enhance

541
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:34,240
the healthy metabolism of estrogen a as

542
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,919
opposed to allowing it to

543
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,038
recirculate uh this group of vegetables

544
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:44,799
call is in includes kale cauliflower

545
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:49,200
broccoli brussels sprouts and arugula

546
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:52,000
the the vegetables that cause gas

547
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,759
bloating just to warn you it's not easy

548
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,679
to eat a lot of

549
00:25:53,759 --> 00:26:00,679
that we also encourage exercise exercise

550
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,798
can decrease the intensity of cramps

551
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,640
because exercise increases anandamide

552
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:08,278
levels which can lead to calming relief

553
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,080
of pain and certainly improved mood yoga

554
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:12,480
in

555
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:14,798
particular has specific poses and

556
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,798
stretches for the relief of this Mina

557
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:20,278
Tai Chi is another the exercises that

558
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:22,558
have spiritual components energy

559
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:25,960
components to them are very very

560
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:28,519
effective in managing some symptoms of

561
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,600
endometriosis we then titr trated the

562
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:34,599
patient to a Type 3 CB that's CBD

563
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,278
dominant tincture 10 to 15 milligrams

564
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:39,158
once or twice a day depending on

565
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:42,278
symptoms she also vaporized with type 1

566
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:45,278
flower um on my slide you'll see it's

567
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:49,519
six plus to 1 to three tincture that is

568
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:51,200
not CBD dominant that six should be 10

569
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,398
plus

570
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:59,120
always then that it'll be CBD

571
00:26:54,398 --> 00:27:01,158
dominant we also used a she used a

572
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,678
vaporized with a type one flower for

573
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:08,600
breakthrough pain and for sleep or for

574
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:11,120
Sleep the addition of and this is the

575
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:13,480
part that was really very helpful the

576
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:16,678
addition of a type one or type two

577
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,839
vaginal suppository really helped to

578
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:22,038
significantly improve improve the pelvic

579
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:25,480
pain and allowed her to have

580
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:28,720
intercourse uh in uh suppositories are

581
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,679
hard to find and um

582
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,120
hopefully companies are coming out with

583
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,080
some suppositories with a shelf life and

584
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:41,398
are effective and can have a lot of the

585
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,918
aspects of the plant in them um I right

586
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:47,359
now I have patients make their own and

587
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,759
it can be difficult and cumbersome but

588
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,879
endomet patients with endometriosis are

589
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:56,079
determined to relieve their pain

590
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,480
cannabis tees as Dustin mentioned are

591
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:01,720
also very helpful

592
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:06,360
uh because you can get thca put a little

593
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:09,038
bud in the in the water uh thca will

594
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:11,199
stay thca because the water isn't hot

595
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,759
enough to cause lead to decarbox

596
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,399
silation this patient is now productive

597
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:19,960
in her vocation has an improved quality

598
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:23,199
of life and has a healthy sex life with

599
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,919
her husband in fact he sent me

600
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,000
flowers saying thank you this was really

601
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:33,759
life-changing for this patient now to

602
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,880
summarize and oh I'm running on time yes

603
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:39,038
cannabis has been used throughout

604
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,960
history in uh to treat conditions in

605
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,798
people assigned female at Birth just

606
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,278
read Dr Russo's history of cannabis in

607
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,079
OBGYN historical review it's an

608
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:52,720
excellent excellent paper endometriosis

609
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:55,038
is a debilitating disease it affects

610
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,120
patients in all aspects of their life

611
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,000
including their families become familiar

612
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,918
with the theory clinical endoc conoid

613
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,319
deficiency it's a theory but it

614
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,159
certainly can be a helpful guide in your

615
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:10,158
management or certainly in thinking of

616
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:12,679
what to do in certain

617
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,799
conditions whole plant cannabis should

618
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,159
be considered as an option in a holistic

619
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:20,200
program be willing to use different

620
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,080
modes of delivery for the same patient

621
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,759
and I did not know Dustin speaking

622
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:28,480
before me was going to say what I just

623
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:31,759
said people with endometriosis are using

624
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,278
cannabis and many are getting the relief

625
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,720
they have long

626
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:41,278
sought they conventional treatment is

627
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:43,450
mediocre at best and why not try

628
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,960
cannabis thank

629
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,078
[Applause]

630
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,078
[Music]

631
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,240
you and I don't think I have time for

632
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:59,119
questions but I will be here all day

633
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,120
today thank you
