1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,028
all right so today we're gonna walk

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:08,580
through utilizing the Koji browser this

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:11,309
is a genome browser where we have a lot

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,769
of ties into canopy dia so much of the

5
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:18,210
data that was in this bio archive

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:22,230
preprint we have over here is now up in

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,019
viewable in encoding so this this

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,880
consists of well the paper at 42 genomes

9
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:28,169
there's now 47 genomes that are up in

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,448
Koji and that number will keep planning

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,030
but these are whole genome shotguns done

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,840
with Illumina all mapped to a packed bio

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,700
generated pan trio reference a pan

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,670
genome is just multiple genomes that are

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,539
that build a reference together and we

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,850
have a a maternal reference a paternal

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,090
reference and an offspring reference all

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,469
assembled with Pacific Biosciences here

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,050
these is a long Reed sequencer that

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,780
generates reference grade genomes and

21
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:59,369
the N 50 s of these genomes are really

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,939
contiguous the most contiguous genomes

23
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:04,948
and been put public so and 50 is the

24
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,780
average size of the context in the

25
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:08,429
genome and the average for these are

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,210
over a million bases or usually around 3

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,470
million bases in length and that number

28
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,089
goes a little bit further north if you

29
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,450
get rid of some of the small contexts so

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,770
anyway the the important thing to know

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,540
about these genomes is they have the

32
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,609
highest busco score out there busco is a

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,810
tool that's utilized to measure the

34
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:28,890
completeness of genomes ok so that can

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,509
be seen right here here's the mother

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,340
father and the offspring this is the end

37
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,368
50 number the average size the contact

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,409
lengths and again this is including a

39
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:38,549
lot of small context a lot of people

40
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,109
like to screen out the things that are

41
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,640
under 50 KB and these numbers climb a

42
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,739
little bit but we've left them in there

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,319
for completeness you can see the genome

44
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,759
size is very the the paternal genomes

45
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,319
are bigger because they have a Y

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,569
chromosome this one's a female and the

47
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,718
bosco scores is the percent completeness

48
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:02,279
by looking for around 2,400 or so genes

49
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:04,199
that should be in all plant genomes and

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,670
so this is approaching the highest we've

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,899
seen I don't think we've ever seen this

52
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,000
number and assembly go higher than

53
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,288
ninety seven point eight that's not a

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,449
reference that we're working on right

55
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,909
now that's a little bit a little bit

56
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:18,109
different than these but

57
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:20,479
no nevertheless this is the set of

58
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,810
references we're using to map all of the

59
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,340
other 40 genomes against this okay now

60
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,080
in addition to mapping those 40 whole

61
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,250
genomes shotguns against this data set

62
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,900
we have done I so seek which is single

63
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,319
molecule sequencing unpacked by all of

64
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,700
the RNA transcripts across five tissues

65
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,669
this gives us an idea of where the genes

66
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:43,449
are you can see we've got about 27,000

67
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:46,729
maternal genes and 32,000 paternal genes

68
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:49,879
the exome size is anywhere between 40 to

69
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:50,659
50 mega bases the coding size is a

70
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,909
little smarter than that

71
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:54,799
so the the c.d.s size is different than

72
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:56,750
the exome size because the exome can

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,740
have the 5 Prime and the three prime

74
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,979
untranslated regions all right these are

75
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,010
utrs

76
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:05,659
okay so you we make an RNA molecule you

77
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,639
often include the promoter in the

78
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:10,009
Terminator in the RNA which aren't

79
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:12,049
necessarily read into proteins they're

80
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:15,620
just used to regulate it that's how the

81
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,140
exome includes the the CD s so the CD s

82
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,349
is always the subset of the exome and

83
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:24,559
then if you look at how much genetic

84
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:27,859
distance these things span across since

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,810
genes can have large introns that means

86
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,660
these are the gaps in between the the

87
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,120
expressed regions there were the exons

88
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:38,329
this this this really spreads across 120

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,030
to 160 mega bases in the plant so a lot

90
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,219
of data in there a21 I want to share a

91
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,780
couple other points of this data set to

92
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:49,639
you this here is a copy number map of

93
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,729
all of the other genomes that we

94
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,379
sequenced against the Jamaican lion

95
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:56,780
paternal reference okay so this paternal

96
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:00,169
reference has y chromosomes in there and

97
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:03,229
you can see there's zero coverage over

98
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:06,530
any of those contexts in all of these

99
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:09,319
lines and it turns out those ones all

100
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,780
happen to be the males these ones we

101
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,039
know are female and I'm sorry these ones

102
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,199
all happen to be the females and these

103
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,459
ones happen to be the males male female

104
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,389
and you can see there's coverage of

105
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,560
those regions in the males and there

106
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:24,560
isn't any of the females that's how we

107
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,418
identify the Y chromosome it's actually

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,680
a little bit bigger than this there's

109
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:29,089
some some

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,918
versions of the y-chromosome that are

111
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:33,469
known as the pseudo autosomal region

112
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,599
which is still recombining with y which

113
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,100
means it still has some highs are y and

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,240
x those the portions of wine x are still

115
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,820
recombining which means it still has

116
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,680
some homology to the X chromosome and

117
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:44,329
then down here you can see the females

118
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,509
have twice the amount of coverage on

119
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:49,038
these contexts and they have they're

120
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:51,379
normally covered in the mail so this is

121
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:54,409
the putative X chromosome material as

122
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:56,600
well so the X chromosome probably

123
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,580
entails some of these other areas as

124
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,080
well it's usually around over 100 mega

125
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:02,209
bases and when we add up everything

126
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,339
that's going on the Y the Y's the

127
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:07,038
largest chromosome as well so al are

128
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:08,719
just a little bit larger than X that

129
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,159
copy number of maps just helps you to

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,860
identify which ones are definitively

131
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,949
male and female this is a pedigree that

132
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,590
was sequenced okay so we did PacBio

133
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:21,650
sequencing on this one this one in this

134
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:23,029
one this one is a runt it's a parent at

135
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:24,709
this stage in its life but you'll see

136
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:26,448
some pictures for that it's actually a

137
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:28,189
runt and we chose that as the offspring

138
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:29,538
of sequence because we thought we might

139
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:32,449
learn something about yield in that

140
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:34,699
genome since it seems to lack it and

141
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,470
then all the other ones we put through

142
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:38,210
Illumina sequencing and mapped it back

143
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,099
to the maternal or paternal reference

144
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:44,810
which you're going to see all of these

145
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:46,579
BAM files in this koji database a couple

146
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,430
different aspects that you're welcome to

147
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:51,589
read in this paper these are the single

148
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,598
nucleotide polymorphisms and the

149
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,339
insertions and deletions under 50 bases

150
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:57,680
that are found across all of the 40

151
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:59,719
genomes we've got the type ones the type

152
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,550
twos and the type 3 plants up here the

153
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,259
jamaican lion family is in here you can

154
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,819
see there's less variation amongst it's

155
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,650
their own family that's because we're

156
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,629
mapping the family back to its to its

157
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:10,519
parent and of course there's less

158
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:12,889
variance that way but as you begin to

159
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:16,310
map hemp samples and other type 1

160
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:19,639
samples against against this these

161
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:23,689
genomes you start to see a much much

162
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:26,870
more diversion in diversity so ok so you

163
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:28,370
will see VCF files inside koji that I'm

164
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:33,949
going to show you that describe some of

165
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:35,990
this data this is a coverage correlation

166
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:38,810
analysis of the whole genome sequencing

167
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,668
data now this is just here a note the

168
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,269
scale here this is very very high

169
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:43,189
leaking

170
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,810
in coverage across the genomes but

171
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,310
there's a couple genomes in here that

172
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,699
are some of the most diverse genomes

173
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,009
we've ever seen this is the the 83 set

174
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:55,189
this is a unique set of plants minimus

175
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,720
owns and they may have some some hops

176
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,978
heritage to them as well there's been

177
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,289
some really interesting crossbreeding

178
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:01,038
they've been trying to do hops but most

179
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:02,478
the sequence we're seeing is

180
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,310
predominantly cannabis but you can see

181
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,269
is of course the most divergent cannabis

182
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:10,220
sequence we have here so here's a

183
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:14,500
picture of a de you can see its leaves

184
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:17,150
kind of look like basil not serrated and

185
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,589
it's it's powdery mildew resistant its

186
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:21,258
neighbors that are loaded with it never

187
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:22,668
seem to transfer it over to here we've

188
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,800
also seen some of that in Jamaican Lyon

189
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:26,448
family they are powdery mildew resistant

190
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,879
we probably have some pictures of that

191
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,770
we can share as well this is jail five

192
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,240
which turned into being a hyper branched

193
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,529
runt when it came out of the growth

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,180
chamber it was grown in the same

195
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,758
conditions as all its siblings which are

196
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,530
towering over it in this photo so

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,629
there's some interesting things that we

198
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:43,609
learned about what might be driving the

199
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:46,069
lack of growth in that plant now that

200
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,560
you can read about more in the paper so

201
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:50,478
what you're gonna see are a variety of

202
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,658
heat maps that look like this throughout

203
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:56,089
the paper and these are largely heat

204
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:58,579
maps looking at copy number changes of

205
00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:01,728
DNA in the genome what we noticed in

206
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:03,620
cannabis is that it loves to insert and

207
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:05,718
delete copies of genes in fact this is

208
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,280
how it did a can of cannabinoid

209
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,750
gene expansion in the plan is it just

210
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,579
kept making more copies of these things

211
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,468
and that's why there's upwards to 90 of

212
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:14,750
these genes in the genome that have a

213
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:17,930
what looks like an F ad binding domain

214
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,519
and a berberine bridge which is two of

215
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,829
the characteristics of cannabinoids and

216
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,269
phases there's a p fam domain that

217
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:25,609
searches for these in the genome and

218
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,589
that number ranks up there around 90 now

219
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,060
not all of those nine your active some

220
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:30,529
of them are broken or truncated it don't

221
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,509
have the proper start and stop codons

222
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:34,549
and so we've we've then filtered those

223
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:36,288
for a smaller set of genes that you'll

224
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,049
see that we're going to touch on in some

225
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:41,000
of these slides but nevertheless you can

226
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:44,809
do very interesting studies when you

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,169
have sequenced whole genome sequencing

228
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:49,338
data with very few PCR cycles that's an

229
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:51,469
important aspect of doing the method

230
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,880
prep here but when you do that you can

231
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,440
then throw the data up against the

232
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,799
Jamaican line reference and ask which

233
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,540
part

234
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,919
the genome were missing which genes are

235
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:59,599
missing on which genes are amplified

236
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,269
that's what you're looking at this heat

237
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,810
map here is that the genes that are that

238
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:08,839
are in red have been amplified quite a

239
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:11,239
bit and the genes that are blue have

240
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,420
been deleted so you can see already just

241
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,850
in these set of samples here that there

242
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:19,879
is kind of a characteristic of certain

243
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:24,230
TL peas being deleted and certain chitin

244
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,939
aces and mlo regions being amplified and

245
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,899
also some tightness that have been

246
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:32,690
perhaps deleted or amplified so now what

247
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,339
we've been doing is tracking powdery

248
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,769
mildew resistance status across multiple

249
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:40,940
cultivars to see if any of these

250
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:42,649
patterns map with resistance status and

251
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,600
the reason we're looking at chitin aces

252
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,278
and vomiting like proteins and mlo is

253
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,350
these are all the genes and hops that

254
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:49,549
have been hunted down over the years to

255
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,639
be involved in powder and mildew

256
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:54,409
resistance so we already have a few

257
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,879
candidates in here genes that we believe

258
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:57,379
are involved in the powdery mildew

259
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,759
resistance in Jamaican Lyon and we've

260
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,500
cloned those and expressed them and

261
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,799
demonstrate they actually destroy fungi

262
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,360
now that being said we think we have

263
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,909
found a reason for powdered mildew

264
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,230
resistance in Jamaican Lyon we believe

265
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:11,990
there's gonna be convergent evolution

266
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,778
when there's this many chitin aces and

267
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,129
this many tlps other plants are gonna

268
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:17,870
probably find a collection of these

269
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,610
things to amplify that give them

270
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,169
resistance as well but may not show the

271
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,269
same pattern that we see in the Jamaican

272
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:25,129
wine genetics ok so there's multiple

273
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,659
ways to probably scan the resistance cat

274
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,669
and while we think we found one of them

275
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:32,778
it probably may not be 100% reflective

276
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:35,240
of resistance in other lines okay so

277
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:36,528
here's a set that we pulled out that we

278
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,778
know that we believe are playing a role

279
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:41,689
so we've cloned a few of these in fact

280
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:43,939
this TLP 2563 has in fact been cloned

281
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,370
you'll see that work in this paper that

282
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,560
when it is cloned expressed in e.coli

283
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,019
and purified out of a coli and then

284
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,958
placed onto films that are growing

285
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,970
Penicillium and Fusarium we get this

286
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:58,518
type of inhibition in growth when these

287
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,680
chitin aces and TLPs are present

288
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,269
here's a few serie moxie sperm and it's

289
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,099
got less growth over here where we've

290
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:06,440
applied some of the compound than some

291
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,360
of the enzyme and we're put down here it

292
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,300
tends to change the the

293
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,919
a few sarin expression in Fusarium now

294
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:15,169
Fusarium is known that when you give it

295
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,028
mica sides it stops making these

296
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:19,939
pigments it's a sign of it going into

297
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:21,049
Apatow sis and cell death so there's

298
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,700
more to read about this in this paper

299
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,828
but if you really want to dig through

300
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,480
this data you want to get familiar with

301
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:28,370
koji which is the genome browser that

302
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,190
allows you to surf all this stuff now we

303
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,639
left off the last tutorial talking about

304
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:37,640
CBD and THC genetics this here is a heat

305
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,278
map looking at those three genes that we

306
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,889
scan in canopy dia the inactive CBD

307
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:46,850
synthase the active cvd synthase and the

308
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:49,399
active CBD synthase and you can see this

309
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,740
type of pattern here that is inversely

310
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,778
correlated and predicts the typing of

311
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,730
the plants the type 1 2 &amp; 3 status is

312
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:58,370
completely predictable by the presence

313
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,259
and absence of these genes you'll notice

314
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,870
this region isn't almost always

315
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,370
correlated of maybe not here there's a

316
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,440
little bit difference but the deletion

317
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,700
sometimes extends to be a little bit

318
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,430
shorter a little bit longer in this

319
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,800
region of the genome and we get a more

320
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:14,569
or less a very similar prediction with

321
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,879
the gene even right next door to THC

322
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,860
synthase ok now as I mentioned in the

323
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,620
last tutorial there's many other ways to

324
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:25,070
knock out THC synthase we have seen some

325
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,720
type 4 plants that have this gene in red

326
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,430
making you think that it's a type 1

327
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,649
plant but it actually has some point

328
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:33,319
mutations that knock out really key

329
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,570
amino acids and I want to show you how

330
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,430
you can take your VCF file from strains

331
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,589
each loaded into Koji and look for those

332
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:41,479
things because right now the tools we

333
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,699
have in the reports aren't digging that

334
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,560
deep yet the data is there in your in

335
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:47,149
your sequencing data but our software

336
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:48,828
tools haven't gotten smart enough to go

337
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,750
in there and identify the variants and

338
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:52,159
decide which ones really damaging and

339
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,078
which one is and to give you like a

340
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,289
23andme report on every single base

341
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:59,419
we're building that right now but in the

342
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:01,189
meantime we want to enable you to be

343
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:04,509
able to load this stuff into the Koji

344
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:07,010
genome browser and surf it yourself ok

345
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:10,009
so just to give you a sense the

346
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:15,740
complexity that's behind this these are

347
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:18,828
a very large set of cannabinoid synthase

348
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,778
genes 39 of them with 11 other genes

349
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:21,189
that our next-door neighbors to them

350
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:23,889
that

351
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,380
often times of disappear or appear with

352
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:28,120
them there in linkage okay so when these

353
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:30,070
jeans get deleted they sometimes delete

354
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,659
their neighbors too and that's important

355
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,550
to track because if you breed for

356
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:35,589
certain cannabinoids synthase genes to

357
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:37,089
be present or absence in your plants you

358
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,980
really kind of kind of keep track of the

359
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,910
neighbors it's dragon down with it okay

360
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,930
so this is a case here where these sets

361
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:49,149
of genes this is a gene on context

362
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:52,599
it looks at context 756 right there see

363
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:54,579
756 this is the cannabic roaming cluster

364
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,649
it's labeled as inactive THC synthase

365
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,420
because that's what NCBI first learned

366
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:00,850
of this as it was submitted as an

367
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:02,589
inactive THC synthase meaning it makes

368
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,240
very little or no THC synthase but it

369
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,070
might make some and that's something to

370
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,750
keep your eye on it's now been cloned

371
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,190
and it's known to be the cannabic Romijn

372
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,850
synthase cluster okay

373
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,710
so you'll see that many of the lines

374
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:17,950
have copies of this particularly some of

375
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,440
these ones where our are in fact hemp

376
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,240
lines so when you breed for hemp lines

377
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,410
you gotta make sure you if you're a hemp

378
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,210
line that still has eight of these

379
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:26,949
inactive ths and it's just they may

380
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,220
cause a problem they may leak on you and

381
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:32,320
and still be a slightly active right so

382
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,910
a lot of growers right now wanna breed

383
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,940
hemp lines that have this to megabase

384
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:38,500
deletion this there is a common deletion

385
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,500
in the population where this whole

386
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,259
cassette is knocked out it also happens

387
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,809
to knock out these other genes on contig

388
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:50,019
7:56 down here now our paper describes

389
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:52,509
these these other genes here are in fact

390
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,939
pathogen resistance genes okay they're

391
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:56,799
aquaporin receptors they are gibberellin

392
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,170
receptors there's you know they're

393
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,990
important features that go with them so

394
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:04,329
you want to be careful and look at your

395
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,279
plants to know if you are breeding for

396
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,839
one of these things you might want to

397
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,789
pick one that doesn't have as many of

398
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,070
those pathogen resistant genes knocked

399
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:14,019
out like this one here Tibor still has

400
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,839
many of those pathogens Susan's genes

401
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:18,250
but it doesn't have the inactive THC

402
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,260
synthase so the cannabic row means are

403
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,600
gone so this is a great line to perhaps

404
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:24,879
try and breed into a type 3 compliant a

405
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,310
hemp line it may not make a lot of resin

406
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,620
so it may need to be paired with

407
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:33,459
something that does alright you can also

408
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,899
see several type 1 plants often have the

409
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,639
cannabic Romijn cluster

410
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:38,528
and you would really never know if

411
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,789
they're making residual THC because you

412
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:42,759
already have a THC synthesis and they're

413
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:44,860
making plenty but you will see a lot of

414
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,829
plants that don't have the THC synthase

415
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,959
gene and do have a CVD synthase gene but

416
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:51,609
also have kinetic Romi that may be a

417
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,888
problem as we mentioned in the last

418
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,558
thing so anyway there's a lot of

419
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:58,509
cannabic an eye but chroming gene su are

420
00:15:56,558 --> 00:16:00,249
a lot of cannabinoid synthase genes to

421
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:02,649
keep in mind as you're doing these

422
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:04,600
things and breeding because ultimately

423
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:07,778
these are going to be the source of pain

424
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,689
residual cannabinoid expression is not

425
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:12,458
just related to the major genes that are

426
00:16:10,688 --> 00:16:13,719
producing these things many of these old

427
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:16,388
genes might be producing other

428
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,600
cannabinoids rare ones or small amounts

429
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:22,230
of THC and CBD synthase which could

430
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:27,939
wreak havoc in in a hemp compliance

431
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:32,139
program so okay so feel free to find

432
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:35,289
this paper at bio archive and let's go

433
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:38,919
to Koji so if you if you google koji co

434
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:42,419
GE comparative genomics you'll end up at

435
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:44,588
a site like this alright there is a

436
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,719
tutorial here but I'm going to try and

437
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:48,610
do that for you there's a lot of genomes

438
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,920
in here you see there's 50 1000 genomes

439
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,360
in this thing there happens to be a lot

440
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,039
of our cannabis genomes in here too

441
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,230
so if you search for cannabis genomes

442
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,099
you're gonna get a lot of them you want

443
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,159
to click on the one in here that's

444
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,629
certified so right down here there is a

445
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,148
Jamaican lion mother that's been

446
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:06,130
certified and there is a male that's

447
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,898
been certified the certification just

448
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,120
means that the koji team has combed over

449
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:11,500
the annotations and in the genome

450
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,250
structure and they believe it meets a

451
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,078
certain standard and they they certify

452
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:19,720
so these are the best

453
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:22,178
busco score and and fifty genomes out

454
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,709
there you will know we have not put them

455
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:25,990
into chromosomes yet while we are

456
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,459
playing with that or cautious on calling

457
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,230
the chromosomes because they're all very

458
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,659
similar sizes and as we just showed you

459
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,970
there are frequent to Megabass deletions

460
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:35,919
that may make you miss call chromosome 5

461
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,450
versus chromosome 6 because these things

462
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,490
are really close in size and when

463
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,548
there's a 2 Meg deletion there you can

464
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,649
quickly make chromosome 6 mistaken for

465
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:47,329
chromosome 5 I'm not saying they're on 5

466
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:48,979
or 6 and just as an example there are

467
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,658
a lot of these chromosomes are almost

468
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,480
identical in size and so the deletions

469
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:54,860
matter okay

470
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,019
you may see chromosome from us a little

471
00:17:54,859 --> 00:18:00,528
bit later this year but for the most

472
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:03,230
part that level of resolution is a

473
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:09,169
little bit academic at the moment let's

474
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:12,620
open up one of these browsers okay so

475
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:13,399
this we're now into this genome it will

476
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:16,158
show you there's a couple different

477
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:17,719
annotations that we've thrown in here it

478
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,190
will also give you a handful of

479
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,860
experiments that are public and

480
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,380
available for you to surf if you want to

481
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:28,308
download this genome right there is a

482
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:31,010
download button there is a GFF download

483
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:32,720
in here as well we have had some people

484
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,398
report that downloading from GFS from

485
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,220
koji changes the format a little bit so

486
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:38,509
just be aware of that and there are two

487
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,389
different ways to download it there's

488
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:42,200
like through this tab and one other tab

489
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:43,490
that when you click on the actual

490
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,769
experiment itself I think when you

491
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,929
download that you get the exact file we

492
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:49,429
put in there if you download off of this

493
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:51,980
there might be some modification is that

494
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:54,380
Koji added so two different ways to

495
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:59,269
download those just be aware of it okay

496
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:01,940
so let's go browse this genome and this

497
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:05,058
is gonna bring up what's known as a

498
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,919
genome browser and what its gonna ask

499
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:08,089
you for are what coordinates do you want

500
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:15,860
to go to what part of the map are you

501
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:18,199
looking for okay so here we are this is

502
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:20,869
um it's a probably last thing we looked

503
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,269
at let's just go over to let's go to

504
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:26,569
kind of go to THC synthase that's what

505
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:30,700
everyone wants to see 741 I have to know

506
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:30,700
this is a four four one seven zero zero

507
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:39,849
okay

508
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:55,008
where are we oh there we go okay so this

509
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:56,778
shows you the ATC's and G's if you're

510
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:58,878
not familiar with this is an amino acid

511
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,959
translation in three different frames in

512
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:02,868
the top strand and three different

513
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:04,639
frames in the bottom strand you can read

514
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,749
three different frames of DNA when

515
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:08,928
you're trying to convert it into

516
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:10,219
proteins and these red marks are stop

517
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:13,190
codons

518
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:14,869
so usually genes don't have those and so

519
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,609
one way to know what frame your is just

520
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:19,548
look for the longest stretch that

521
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:20,989
doesn't have and you stop codons and

522
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:22,338
with T and sheets in space that's pretty

523
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:24,379
easy you can see there's some Athenian

524
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:30,878
right there you go further back to the

525
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:30,878
start of the gene zoom out a little bit

526
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:38,690
baby steps there you go so start the

527
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:42,138
gene stop at the gene if you click on

528
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:44,749
this you'll get a little messenger RNA

529
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:48,618
with a note of what the database thinks

530
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:50,389
this is we've done some annotation on

531
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:52,189
this and adjusted some of the start and

532
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:54,078
stop codons just to make sure that it's

533
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,479
it's in fact what is seen in the

534
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:58,158
literature you can download the sequence

535
00:20:56,479 --> 00:21:01,219
of it by hitting that fast a button if

536
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,859
you want don't do something like this

537
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:05,328
there's the sequence in fact this is

538
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:06,949
what we use to clone some of those

539
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:08,328
powdery mildew resistance genes we just

540
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,749
clicked on the gene grab this from the

541
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:14,479
start codon set it off to Gen script to

542
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:18,348
get a cloned and sequenced and expressed

543
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:20,319
and now we have protein in a few weeks

544
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:22,729
okay so what are you looking at here

545
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,548
this is as I said the the coding

546
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:27,919
sequence c.d.s if you want to add more

547
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:30,588
features in here you can easily take

548
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,919
that C D s and it'll add it down here

549
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:35,288
you can remove that track if you want

550
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,570
you can remove that track if you want

551
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:41,838
put it back we'll end up down here and

552
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:44,138
then you can also see that we have all

553
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:48,158
of these other reads here this here is

554
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:50,808
female leaf RNA sequence okay this is

555
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,549
when we did I so seek sequencing all

556
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:53,750
these RNA molecules popped out from the

557
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:56,329
leaves that works

558
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,950
synthase that's to be expected this is a

559
00:21:56,329 --> 00:22:01,159
type 2 plant

560
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,840
hello here is a whole genome shotgun of

561
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,550
grapes topper another genome that's been

562
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,929
aligned to this and you can kind of comb

563
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,149
through this and look for variants if

564
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,220
you want let's get that out here cuz it

565
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,550
takes up a lot of memory and work with

566
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,430
these

567
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:17,539
okay so here's th DS and thanks now

568
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,549
other things you might want to look at

569
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:21,619
well if you had your own sample you

570
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:24,109
could load that into the genome browser

571
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:26,179
a VCF file off a canapé dia and see

572
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,799
where all that all the snips are in your

573
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,920
genome then we're gonna do that in just

574
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:34,549
a moment let me just show you something

575
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:40,250
that functionality here okay so these

576
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:42,409
are all the public data possible we you

577
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,579
can hit the structural variation file

578
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,560
here we'll show you where the very

579
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:46,879
large-scale insertions and deletions are

580
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:49,220
on the genome and I don't think you're

581
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,620
gonna find any in Jamaican lion or over

582
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,029
TSU synthase but you may find some other

583
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:57,229
hits over here here's a here's a

584
00:22:53,029 --> 00:23:01,009
deletion shows you its size and some of

585
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:05,329
its attributes now let's go into THC

586
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:06,890
synthase and let's ask her so what do we

587
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:08,899
have in the 40 genomes project in terms

588
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,280
of the VCF file VCF files are variant

589
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,300
call format sand they'll have some of

590
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:17,629
the snips let me see if that peppers

591
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:18,740
this with variants it does you see there

592
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,050
must be another one up here that does

593
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:26,690
that we have a forty genomes in public

594
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:28,730
oh oh there's some annotations in here

595
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,039
this may give you some the gene calls

596
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,680
okay it's kind of redundant oh there is

597
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,690
some work from a group I think 20 labs

598
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,970
that did some aspect profiling and you

599
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,500
can see how many of these genes have

600
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,500
they actually detected them aspect

601
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,079
peptide for and in fact THC synthase

602
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,150
pops out now in our experience 98.8% of

603
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,819
what been ours what has found and is

604
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,830
published we find in the RNA set in

605
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:54,230
Jamaican Lyon but we only found about

606
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:55,519
only about yeah he found about 12,000

607
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,559
peptides and you saw from her slides

608
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,079
over there that we we have like 27 to 32

609
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:03,440
thousand genes and so we're only about

610
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,819
40% of his proteins are or 40% of the

611
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,830
RNA that we have found is accounted for

612
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:09,558
the protein did it that's that's not

613
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:11,028
not unheard of some of the proteins may

614
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:12,440
not be heavily expressed and then the

615
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:16,009
sensitivity machine may and may not pick

616
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,570
him up otherwise so all right so we have

617
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:19,819
a variety of experiments here you can

618
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:22,028
throw on top of this we have the RNA

619
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:24,918
from the female flowers from the leaves

620
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:26,509
from the roots of course there's not a

621
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:26,929
lot of THC synthase expressed in the

622
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:29,990
roots

623
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:31,730
you can see down here let me just get

624
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,429
more room here so nothing from the roots

625
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,589
the seeded female flowers RNA went down

626
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:39,500
a little bit there not be surprised once

627
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:42,009
you start putting seeds out you can see

628
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,538
the expression goes down on THC synthase

629
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:46,339
not surprising and then there's male

630
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:48,288
flowers too and the male flowers aren't

631
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:49,908
making a whole lot of THC synthase all

632
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:52,730
right I think that's probably not

633
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:55,909
surprising to anyone in this field the

634
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:58,880
other thing we have in here are BAM

635
00:24:55,909 --> 00:25:01,850
files this is these are binary after

636
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,528
mapping files okay of about 50 or so

637
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:07,490
strain seek samples that are public in

638
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:10,190
canopy dia so let's take a look at Queen

639
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,839
Jesus now Queen Jesus actually started

640
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,519
out that wants a type 2 3 plant santak

641
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,439
has a type 4 plant so those aren't gonna

642
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,909
have a lot of sequence over this this is

643
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,580
a THC synthase so let's have something

644
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:23,000
that's a type 1 so you can see what the

645
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:25,250
sequence looks like a type 1 may be

646
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,048
serious happiness would be a type 1 so

647
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,210
you can see there's some reads that are

648
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:31,700
covering this region and if we zoom in

649
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,769
on those reads you can see there's

650
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,298
sequence coverage now there is a region

651
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:37,759
of THC synthase that is a little bit

652
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:40,730
tricky to cover because it has homology

653
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,470
to a lot of other cannabinoids and face

654
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,960
genes and so it's hard to place reads in

655
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,069
some portions of it and sometimes the

656
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
coverage might be just be a little light

657
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:50,210
there let's see if we get another one

658
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,859
that's got a little bit more there you

659
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,659
go this region is all tile but there's

660
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:59,388
sometimes some lack of reads there in

661
00:25:53,659 --> 00:26:01,519
the middle let's pull up or maybe

662
00:25:59,388 --> 00:26:04,219
Liberty haze we'll have some depth there

663
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,659
yeah you can get a lot of these now if

664
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,308
you go to something like our Magnolia

665
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:10,370
I'm gonna bet you won't see any Ruiz

666
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:13,038
is a type 3 plant and it is deleted in

667
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:14,778
that region ok so this is the underlying

668
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:19,158
data that's behind the plots in canopy

669
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:20,569
dia now if we did something like put a

670
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:24,170
whole genome shotgun

671
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:25,939
this I think what you'll find these are

672
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,590
whole-genome shotguns right let's find a

673
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,200
whole genome shotgun that's a type one

674
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:32,629
and see what we see

675
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,759
reads tiled all the way across the

676
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,470
region why well whole genome shotgun

677
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,379
takes the whole genome and sequences it

678
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:42,559
so we don't have to try to fish

679
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,510
THC synthase out of the genome to get

680
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,339
coverage over it with a hybridization

681
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:47,750
capture system we just sequence

682
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:50,000
everything is well I'm more expensive

683
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,430
but it's a lot more thorough and it will

684
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,650
it will miss less snips as a result of

685
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:59,180
this particularly in genes that have lot

686
00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:00,620
of homology okay so you can load up all

687
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,759
different types of samples here and look

688
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,009
for variants now let's talk about

689
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:11,839
looking at variants I think if you want

690
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:17,599
to look at variants we probably look at

691
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:19,039
a VCF file and alright so now that we're

692
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,169
looking at your VCF file I'm getting a

693
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,869
little more serious here and putting on

694
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:26,360
a professional look but in all

695
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:29,359
seriousness now well what we need to do

696
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:32,709
in Koji is to actually load up your VCF

697
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:35,719
file and you have to have a cyber

698
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,759
saccade a day in tukoji but it's really

699
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,829
simple fill out an email address you'll

700
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,390
get a koji account in the day and then

701
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:42,980
you can upload your own data to this

702
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,290
browser and overlay with all the data

703
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,240
that we have public so the way you do

704
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:50,839
that is you go over here to experiments

705
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:55,099
you click new you click new experiment

706
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:58,299
or load exp and this should bring up a

707
00:27:55,099 --> 00:28:00,319
window that allows us to load up a file

708
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:03,230
so we're gonna hit the upload button

709
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,750
here and choose a file and you want to

710
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,039
pick your VCF file there's one right

711
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,319
there now these can be a little big

712
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,940
sometimes so we'll just let's just see

713
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:12,939
how well it soaks this up

714
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:22,389
we're in that range right now and once

715
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:26,039
this realizes this is the VCF file you

716
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:28,360
hit next fill out some meta information

717
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,920
now I already have a version of this

718
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,069
running that we can skip to all that

719
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,690
thing is thinking this is what you'll

720
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:37,089
ultimately receive when you're done

721
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,740
loading it after the files been loaded

722
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:41,019
up you'll have all this information and

723
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,759
it will it will collect some of the

724
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,139
metadata some of the metadata it asked

725
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,059
for you can see in the background here

726
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,320
ask for a name you could put a

727
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:48,429
description we didn't put much in

728
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:51,339
because it's just a test

729
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:53,200
a version the site that it was generated

730
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:54,849
to whether it's restricted we left it

731
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,009
it's private right here so you can load

732
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:59,339
your data in and you can view it against

733
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:01,420
all the data we have in our database

734
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:03,849
privately and you don't have to put your

735
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:09,759
put any of your findings public in this

736
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:12,250
regard okay so that's what that looks

737
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:14,319
like you'll see here this is an

738
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,150
important step I've bounced over to this

739
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,309
to this step here to make sure that's a

740
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,540
VCF file there's a lot of different

741
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:21,519
files you can upload but you want to

742
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:24,819
make sure you call it what this is and

743
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,379
when you go next it'll ask I haven't

744
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:28,359
really used these features yet this will

745
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,860
send you an email when it's done but it

746
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:31,269
only takes a few minutes for a VCF file

747
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:34,599
that's more important for BAM files I

748
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:36,220
can take an hour and there's notebook

749
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:38,980
features in here that I've not yet

750
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,930
explored and then when you hit next here

751
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,519
it's gonna start uploading I'm just

752
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:44,950
gonna actually cancel out of this

753
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:49,629
because we've already done that section

754
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:52,029
over here and then just hit OK so now

755
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:55,970
that we have that loaded up what we can

756
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:58,759
do is look for it

757
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,049
in a lot of the data that's up here and

758
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:09,319
I'm just gonna search for it I think

759
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:13,309
it's there we go right there so that's

760
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:15,970
the VCF file we load it up we're gonna

761
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:15,970
hit view data

762
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:24,460
we can even make it public just like

763
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:27,340
that real easy hit browse and it will

764
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,799
probably load up the genome with this

765
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:31,209
VCF file layered against it now it's a

766
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,950
variant call format that just means

767
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,569
every line is a list of a coordinate of

768
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,220
the genome with a particular base change

769
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:39,849
and some quality information about that

770
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,650
base change for instance is how many

771
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:44,019
reads are contributing to that base

772
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,610
change so when you're zoomed really far

773
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:47,849
out like this you start to get a density

774
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:51,689
plot of where all the polymorphisms are

775
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:57,009
now let's go again to our favorite gene

776
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:58,929
four four one seven now if you don't

777
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:00,220
recall four four one seven I have that

778
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:01,450
burned in my brain but you don't have to

779
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,370
have it burned into your brain you can

780
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:08,289
just go up here and say I like I like

781
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:10,149
take THC touch' hydro is search oh I

782
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:11,769
forgot to check all these and then hit

783
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,559
OK and it will come up with a list of

784
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:18,670
all the different THC like genes in the

785
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,649
content and I'm gonna bet that one's a

786
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,690
right no and that's not it that's it

787
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,160
right there that's the one that is the

788
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,410
active T issue synthase

789
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:34,500
I just kind of remember that by the

790
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:34,500
coordinate and let's see

791
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:42,148
let's get some of this play we want to

792
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,149
see what jeans are

793
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:53,840
feature c.d.s there we go the coding

794
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:57,529
sequence squish that back zoom this out

795
00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:01,678
and what you're seeing here are

796
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:05,220
different variants c-to-t variant at

797
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:08,330
this coordinate near TSU synthase you

798
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,329
can see another one over here

799
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:15,840
and the blur here right now you zoom out

800
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,200
a lot in this you'll see many many more

801
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,199
snips

802
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:30,369
and each one of those is variant alright

803
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,610
so that's how you load your data into

804
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:35,769
Koji and there's a there's a ways to

805
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:38,289
load fast queues in here as well so it's

806
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:40,210
a it's a very helpful tool allows you to

807
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,920
search around the genome and look for

808
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,069
particular key genes by looking through

809
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,660
this feature function there's also some

810
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,950
other comparative genomic tools in here

811
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,320
that people should know about if you

812
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,730
were to actually go back there's

813
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,750
actually a tutorial on how use this so

814
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,120
I'm gonna point into the tutorial

815
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:59,559
because that's probably a better way to

816
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:01,689
do it but there are other comparative

817
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:06,429
genomic tools in here given this as the

818
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:10,150
comparative genomics genome browser if

819
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:12,100
you go up to I think tools up here

820
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,540
you'll see those likes in maps a very

821
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:14,980
good tool to do genome to genome

822
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:21,039
alignments in fact let's do one right

823
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:26,829
now takes in map and a line now it will

824
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:29,619
only do alignments of genomes that are

825
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:31,119
I'm going to use to map to that have

826
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:34,509
annotations on them and they're very few

827
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:38,019
of them have annotations right now my

828
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:40,230
instant map maybe it's in that 3d let me

829
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,230
see

830
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:46,050
oh that's crazy I don't want to do

831
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,049
three-dimensional genome

832
00:33:51,660 --> 00:34:01,110
all righty sit map - we're on select

833
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:03,189
organisms so if you just go here and go

834
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:06,659
cannabis it's gonna bring you up a lot

835
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:12,940
of different versions of cannabis and

836
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:14,740
let's take what you're making lion as I

837
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:20,070
mean isn't one and then let's do the

838
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:20,069
same over here cannabis

839
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:29,450
and let me see no coatings let me see

840
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:32,480
they don't this one so CVT rx has

841
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:34,389
annotations purple kush just not of

842
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:40,190
annotations yet although they're in NCBI

843
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:46,839
this does not have annotations maybe

844
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:46,840
that one does now okay

845
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:55,898
so there let's put on CB DRX Jeremy it's

846
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,059
hidden map now this is gonna run a

847
00:34:55,898 --> 00:35:01,119
program in the background and it will

848
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:02,349
get back to you the map now that

849
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,029
probably doesn't look very good to

850
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:09,449
anyone here so there are some features

851
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,450
in here that will make this compare them

852
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:23,879
and more meaningful way if you want this

853
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:26,769
at 24 or and for and I think the most

854
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:31,019
important feature you know you had total

855
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:31,019
chromosomes where 10 has that's a

856
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:47,650
now let's do some KNK s it's always fun

857
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:47,650
now let's give that a shot

858
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:56,869
now if you're if you've run an analysis

859
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:59,089
on here it will remember that and only

860
00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:00,380
run the piece of your analysis that's

861
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,260
needed like this

862
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,550
Diana right now if it's been run before

863
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,250
and you happen to compare the same

864
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:09,110
genomes you know side by side it'll just

865
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,940
recall the old time that you ran that it

866
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,200
has a running memory of the analyses

867
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,990
that you front of the pass but if you

868
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:17,829
change any one of these numbers it's

869
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:17,829
going to have to rerun it

870
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,740
that would take a little time

871
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,120
close out of some of these now

872
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,850
and we may have to come back to that

873
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:45,710
later timing but this usually gives you

874
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:48,319
some dot plots comparing one genome to

875
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,909
another and you'll see some of these in

876
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,350
our manuscript actually so we don't have

877
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:53,059
to wait for this but there are actually

878
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:56,389
in one of our figures but you can see

879
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:57,679
Jamaican line lined up to to CBDR X it

880
00:36:56,389 --> 00:37:00,949
just gives you an understanding of which

881
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,569
context in our genome are the

882
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:04,609
corresponding contexts and their genome

883
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,890
it actually gives you an excel file that

884
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:09,320
you can use to download if you ever want

885
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:11,480
to do you know comparative genomics

886
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,670
between two different genomes alright so

887
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,659
lots of good tools in there and we'll

888
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:19,490
leave it at that and probably put in a

889
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:22,039
another tutorial on some other

890
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:24,549
functionality on this as the eo3

891
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,550
thank you
