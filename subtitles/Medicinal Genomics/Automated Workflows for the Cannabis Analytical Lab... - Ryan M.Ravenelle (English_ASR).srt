1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:09,189
so we're gonna switch gears a little bit

2
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:12,939
here and talk about candlelit cannabis

3
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:15,099
from an analytical perspective again I'm

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:16,809
Ryan Ravenel I work for Hamilton company

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,789
specifically for the robotics division

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,678
and the title of my talk today is

7
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,868
automated workflows for the cannabis

8
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:25,509
analytical lab increasing sample

9
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:27,309
throughput and data reliability so I'm

10
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:28,719
first gonna just kind of introduce

11
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:30,879
Hamilton I promise this isn't a

12
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,479
marketing heavy presentation just so you

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,219
know who Hamilton is and what we do

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,558
we're a global enterprise a global

15
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:42,159
company we were founded in the 1950s by

16
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:44,049
Clark Hamilton our flagship product is

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,608
our syringe if you've ever done any kind

18
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,589
of chromatography in your life you

19
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:50,530
probably know the Hamiltons syringe it's

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,410
kind of our famous product but but since

21
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,750
then Hamilton has really grown we

22
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:58,328
provide a variety of analytical products

23
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,750
and systems for the laboratory we sell

24
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:04,629
into a variety of different industries

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,510
we have robotics as I mentioned devices

26
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:10,750
consumables customized solutions and we

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,760
also do om agreements so we our original

28
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,689
equipment manufacturers for variety

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,150
companies out there so what I'm really

30
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:21,129
going to talk today about is or about

31
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,940
today is our robotics division and

32
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,519
that's who I work for

33
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,079
and when you think Hamilton robotics

34
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,899
what I really want you to think of are

35
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,819
liquid handling solutions so we really

36
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,650
try to drive this home the simplest way

37
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:35,019
to explain it is if you are doing any

38
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,510
kind of liquid handling in your assay or

39
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:39,819
your workflow you can probably benefit

40
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,800
from our automation so we're really

41
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:43,629
talking about taking away the lab tech

42
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,939
who's sitting there pipetting on a bench

43
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:47,859
all day long and really putting that on

44
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:51,640
a robot and freeing up that tech to do

45
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:54,250
other things in your lab so we have

46
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,250
multiple sizes of instruments multiple

47
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,709
configurations we are very integration

48
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:02,950
friendly so we integrate external

49
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:04,869
devices equipment from third party

50
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,460
providers and integrate those into our

51
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,140
platforms to really have an end-to-end

52
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,659
solution for some of the things that are

53
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,128
done in the assay lab we also have on

54
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:14,139
deck tools and devices that we

55
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:16,879
manufacture in addition to integrating

56
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:18,979
with with third-party components

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,530
we're kind of known in the industry for

58
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,659
leading in service and support and we

59
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,939
have a lot of automation experience not

60
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,560
necessarily in the cannabis world this

61
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,530
is kind of a new application in a new

62
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,390
market for us but we do have a lot of

63
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:37,370
automation experiments in in other

64
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:38,509
related markets so I'll get into the

65
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,730
kind of the nuts and bolts of my

66
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:43,789
presentation and I'm gonna talk about

67
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:44,989
why we test cannabis and what's test for

68
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:48,409
in cannabis and that may seem like a

69
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,850
silly question to some but I don't think

70
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,460
anybody here after all the talks we've

71
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:55,609
heard this week there's no question why

72
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,640
we should test you know some of the

73
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,960
concerns with cannabis some of the

74
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,669
concerns and challenges that are

75
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,770
actually facing laboratories right now

76
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:05,569
and some of the opportunities that we

77
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,850
think Hamilton automation and automation

78
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,099
in general can can be a big help and

79
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:12,319
then I'm gonna briefly go over some

80
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:13,819
preliminary experimental results that we

81
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,590
have some data that's related to

82
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,870
workflows that are specific to the

83
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:22,400
cannabis testing laboratory and wrap up

84
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,140
with some conclusions so I'm gonna start

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,620
off my presentation with some really bad

86
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:32,539
examples product recalls are prevalent

87
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,390
in many different industries it seems

88
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:36,859
like you can't open up the paper at

89
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,469
least with once a month hearing about a

90
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,090
product recall but I highlighted two

91
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,719
cases because I think these are relevant

92
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,860
to the medicinal cannabis world's

93
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,150
specifically this McNeill consumer

94
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,330
health care so if you if you don't

95
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,950
remember this in 2010 McNeill had a

96
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,340
massive recall of children's

97
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:56,899
over-the-counter medicine this affected

98
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,560
about a hundred and thirty million

99
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,620
bottles of medicine and just to give you

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,629
an idea of what was wrong with these

101
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,980
products I'm gonna read the quote so

102
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,000
some of the products included in the

103
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,859
recall may contain a higher

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,530
concentration of active ingredient than

105
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,610
specified others contain inactive

106
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,199
ingredients that may not meet

107
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,470
internalist testing requirements and

108
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,879
others may contain tiny particles well

109
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,010
it turns out those tiny particles were

110
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,829
actually metal shards from the equipment

111
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,418
manufacturing line and that's a big deal

112
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:28,189
especially when you're talking about

113
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:30,139
children's medicine here

114
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:33,019
and the other case that I wanted to

115
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,279
highlight is just from last year you

116
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:36,439
guys may have heard about this case in

117
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:37,969
New Jersey and it was a case that

118
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,219
affected the state police department up

119
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,650
there so there was a a lab technician

120
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,710
there who obviously lost his job after

121
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:48,529
this but he allegedly faked results in a

122
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:52,339
drug in a drug case and drawn into

123
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:54,169
questions 7,800 criminal clay criminal

124
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:56,750
cases on which he worked so he's

125
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,790
essentially accused of making up data he

126
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,050
was observed writing test results for

127
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:04,700
suspected marijuana that was never

128
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:06,379
tested this is really bad and and I

129
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,800
don't mean this slide should really be a

130
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:11,120
scare tactic a scare tactic and and have

131
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,040
everybody questioned everything that's

132
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,430
on the market but I think it's important

133
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,590
to highlight that this does happen this

134
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,810
is a real phenomenon and even in heavily

135
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:22,549
regulated industries so here we're

136
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,500
talking about you know medicine and

137
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,340
we're talking about law enforcement it

138
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,800
happens and so I think it's important to

139
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:33,229
highlight that automation and and

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,790
laboratory practice is are important

141
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:39,200
tools that we can use to prevent things

142
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:42,020
like this from happening so quality

143
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,699
control all marijuana is not created

144
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:46,310
equal I think we all know that that's

145
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,629
been kind of beat to death during this

146
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,800
conference but it's it's important to

147
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:53,060
keep in mind right so dr. Mary had a

148
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,350
great talk there's been other great

149
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,300
talks here that really that really

150
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,430
highlight that what's in your cannabis

151
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,250
strain the active components makes a

152
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,400
huge difference on the condition you're

153
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,009
trying to treat and the effects that the

154
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,560
individual is going to feel so you know

155
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,120
you're not going to take a pill at least

156
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,769
probably most of us here wouldn't take a

157
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,360
pill which you had no idea what was in

158
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:19,549
it and so it's important to have quality

159
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,580
data out there that consumers can trust

160
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,770
and and the also the other flip side of

161
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:26,300
it is it's important to know what's in

162
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:29,479
your cannabis but it's also important to

163
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,220
know what's not in your cannabis so I

164
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,310
feel bad for this guy right here he's

165
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,080
kind of synonymous now with with

166
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,668
pesticides in cannabis he's the first

167
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,918
picture that comes up when you google

168
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:41,719
search cannabis and pesticide so I

169
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:42,219
blanked out his face there to give him a

170
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,430
little

171
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:50,060
and I feel bad for him because you know

172
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:53,030
it's not really his fault he's the case

173
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,030
of using the wrong pesticides in

174
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:59,448
cannabis it's an education issue it's a

175
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:01,969
lack of oversight issue so you guys may

176
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:05,270
have heard in 2005 Colorado actually

177
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,009
withheld up to 60,000 plants for

178
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:08,659
pesticide contamination and that the

179
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,939
pesticide that was implicated there was

180
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,729
called Michael a butanol and what

181
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:15,529
happens is this is a pesticide that's

182
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:17,629
used for normal agricultural products

183
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:19,399
everyday products that we consume but

184
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,500
when it's exposed to heat it forms

185
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,909
hydrogen cyanide gas and if there's

186
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,538
something you don't want to be smoking

187
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,039
its hydrogen cyanide gas so again it's a

188
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:31,668
it's kind of a knowledge and an

189
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:38,389
experience thing and and it's a real

190
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:40,459
problem out there and so why kind of art

191
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,110
are some of these problems in what kind

192
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,299
of issues as a lab have to deal with

193
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,800
well it's always a balancing act from

194
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,680
the analytical perspective right you

195
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,710
have on one side you have producers and

196
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,319
growers who have expectations they want

197
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:56,359
cheap tests they want accurate tests and

198
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,439
they want fast tests they don't want

199
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,210
product locked up or being essentially

200
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,189
burned or destroyed because it fails

201
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,629
tests and they don't want their product

202
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:07,069
sitting around waiting for results so

203
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:09,829
that they can sell it and that makes

204
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:13,519
sense on the other hand you have

205
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:15,829
consumers and they care about product

206
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,549
safety they care about quality

207
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:21,288
ingredients they care about getting the

208
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,750
proper medicine for the condition that

209
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:26,449
they have so it's really how do you as

210
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,050
an analytical laboratory kind of balance

211
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,580
these needs and I think that automation

212
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:36,560
in general is a very good tool that we

213
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:40,009
can use to kind of satisfy these so

214
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,319
there's good news a little bit of

215
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:44,179
myth-busting is that nothing that's

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,480
being done in this in these labs is new

217
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,338
and it's kind of it's kind of

218
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,199
interesting I think since this industry

219
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,820
grew literally out of garages and

220
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,949
basements and it's been underground for

221
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,290
so long

222
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,060
that there's still kind of a lot of

223
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:01,240
tribal knowledge even in the laboratory

224
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:04,719
setting out there and a lot of kind of

225
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,070
belief that that they're unique and that

226
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,840
the things they're doing have never been

227
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,670
done before but that's absolutely not

228
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,769
true all the things that are being done

229
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:14,769
in in in the analytical lab from for

230
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:16,240
cannabis is all stuff that has been used

231
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:18,490
for a long time and is very well

232
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,100
established yes the applications new but

233
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,070
but the methods are out there they're

234
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,700
using liquid and gas chromatography mass

235
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:30,220
spectrometry mass spectrometry microbial

236
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,080
contamination measurement via whether it

237
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,570
be its PCR or plating out and doing

238
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,700
colony counts I mean this is this is not

239
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,580
new stuff and I think this is good news

240
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,710
for the cannabis industry there's a lot

241
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,620
of Technology and a lot of knowledge out

242
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:46,450
there related to you know the food

243
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,009
agriculture and consumer product safety

244
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:59,200
testing markets drug discovery markets

245
00:09:50,009 --> 00:10:01,539
the informations out there so what is

246
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,940
usually done at a cannabis facility when

247
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,019
they're doing testing well it depends on

248
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,480
what state you live in

249
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:09,730
unfortunately the regulations fluctuate

250
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,039
quite wildly depending on where you are

251
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,600
geographically in the country but let's

252
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,799
look at some of the common panels that

253
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,620
are done so moisture content potency

254
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:23,129
analysis terpene analysis foreign matter

255
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,509
inspections microbial screening

256
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:28,840
mycotoxins screening which mycotoxin is

257
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:32,289
mold residual solvent if it happens to

258
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,629
be an extract or a shatter you don't

259
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:36,459
want to probably be smoking an extract

260
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:38,049
that has a lot of butane left over in it

261
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,259
for example so this is important to look

262
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:43,779
at heavy metal screening is another one

263
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:44,919
and that and that heavily relies on the

264
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,299
type of fertilizer and the growing

265
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,949
conditions at the plants are in because

266
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:50,529
they're very good at soaking up what's

267
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,030
in the soil around them and also as I've

268
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,459
already mentioned the pesticide residue

269
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,409
analysis so the ones I have highlighted

270
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,400
in green are really amenable to

271
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:00,009
automation I'm going to talk a little

272
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,419
bit more about that so let's look at the

273
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,189
protocols that are done in a in a

274
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:05,620
typical potency analysis or a pesticide

275
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,779
analysis well the workflows are very

276
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,759
similar the steps that are used are

277
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:12,278
things that are used in industries all

278
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,499
over you're gonna be grinding sample so

279
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:16,659
modernizing samples adding extraction

280
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:18,370
solvents vortexing and mixing your

281
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:20,350
samples in your in your extraction

282
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,938
protocol probably doing some kind of

283
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,089
separation whether it's a filtration

284
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:26,349
we're doing a solid phase extraction

285
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:29,470
extracting your analyte of interest and

286
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,790
then doing an analysis so so these are

287
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,870
common things and these are things that

288
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:33,490
Hamilton has a lot of experience

289
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,438
automating and I'm going to talk

290
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,720
specifically kind of about separation

291
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:39,188
and and cleanup or solid phase

292
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,910
extraction that's used in pesticides

293
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:44,889
pesticide analysis so we have some

294
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:50,049
results here some quick data it's it's

295
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:51,490
it's very very brief but it kind of

296
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:53,828
shows it gives you guys a flavor for

297
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,480
what we do and some of the solutions

298
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:58,929
that we have that are applicable to this

299
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,209
market so in separations we did a quick

300
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,568
study here comparing three different

301
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:06,188
sample matrices it's flour edible and

302
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:08,169
concentrate and this is done with one of

303
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:10,629
our partners in California a very

304
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:11,919
reputable lab there so this is using a

305
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,079
device that we have a nifty little

306
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,490
device called our NP e squared it's a

307
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:16,870
horrible acronym I'm not going to tell

308
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,818
you what it stands for but it's

309
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,129
basically just a positive pressure

310
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:22,870
extraction module and what you're able

311
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:25,720
to do with this module is you can see in

312
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,669
the little cartoon there is input a

313
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,028
filter plate for example a 96-well

314
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:32,528
filter plate pull that into the unit

315
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:34,688
have a collection plate underneath and

316
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:37,958
apply pressurized gas and you can

317
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:41,289
basically do a one-shot filtration of 96

318
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:43,479
samples so if you've ever done hand

319
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:45,188
filtration in a lab like for example a

320
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,199
syringe filter you know it's a huge pain

321
00:12:45,188 --> 00:12:49,299
I mean you got to put a sample in a in a

322
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:51,008
syringe it's usually a lure locks or a

323
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:52,628
filter you got to push it through

324
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:54,159
manually it's it's kind of a pain so

325
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:57,009
when you have something like this you

326
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,928
can do a full plate in one shot so we

327
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,490
looked at a comparison between that

328
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:02,799
traditional manual filtration with the

329
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,230
syringe and and some samples that we

330
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:09,549
filtered on our unit and compared them

331
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:11,379
so this is a table showing the results

332
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:13,208
here the thing to take aways if you can

333
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:15,308
you compare the mean values that we

334
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,778
measured for the analytes with the

335
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,990
manual method compared to the NPA

336
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:20,299
squared

337
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,639
we typically had higher mean values that

338
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,049
we were measuring we don't really know

339
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,819
why this is but it's a trend that we

340
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:27,409
consistently noticed and if you look at

341
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,839
the standard deviation as a percentage

342
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:31,459
of the mean you can see that we had a

343
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,839
better standard deviation which at the

344
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,230
end of the day means your data is more

345
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,880
reproducible and more reliable other

346
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,200
things to highlight from the study are

347
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:45,139
our savings on consumables and time so

348
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,270
this lab happened to tell us that they

349
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:50,110
probably saves at least 30 seconds per

350
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:52,909
sample going with the automated method

351
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,370
and 40% on consumables going with the

352
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:57,199
plate and a lot less waste generation

353
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:02,539
for example and a lot less manual

354
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:04,759
intervention another highlight of this

355
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:06,708
unit that we've used it for solid phase

356
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:08,419
extraction or a cleanup step and

357
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,889
pesticide analysis so typically when

358
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,809
you're doing a pesticide analysis you

359
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:14,539
add your sample some kind of internal

360
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:17,088
standard water you're adding in some

361
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:20,059
kind of extraction solvent some salts to

362
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,740
promote separation you spin it down or

363
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:24,199
do a separation step and then you take

364
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,240
that supernatant and that supernatant

365
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,800
has to be cleaned up again so typically

366
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,930
what happens is that supernatant goes

367
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,240
into a tube manually with some resin you

368
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:35,000
shake it vortex it makes it spin it down

369
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,370
again transfer that into your machine

370
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,009
for analysis well in this case we we ran

371
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,330
that normal standard method and then we

372
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,399
just took a plate that had the cleanup

373
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,528
resin in it directly transferred

374
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,120
supernet supernatant sample into there

375
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:50,019
pushed it through in our device and went

376
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,970
straight to the analytical machine and

377
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:55,370
so here's again a table summarizing the

378
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,250
results one thing to note is the

379
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,299
recovery the pesticide recovery was

380
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,828
significantly lower with the automatic

381
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,828
with the automated method and we think

382
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:08,000
there's things that can be done to to

383
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:10,069
increase that but it overall not bad we

384
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,078
have the recovery there and depending on

385
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,870
what state you're in right how they set

386
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,449
their limit how they regulate pesticides

387
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,459
the recovery may not be a huge issue and

388
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,720
there's things you can do to correct for

389
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,458
that for example with an internal

390
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,589
standards but one thing to highlight

391
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:28,189
about this is the savings on on prep

392
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:29,690
time about an hour over 96 samples and I

393
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,430
know this doesn't sound like much to

394
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,680
people but

395
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:36,019
we'll talk about how sample throughputs

396
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,569
likely gonna increase here very soon for

397
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:41,360
a lot of these labs there's other

398
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,190
options that we have on our instruments

399
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,330
and people are unaware of these so I

400
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,710
just thought I'd kind of throw them out

401
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,629
there there's companies our

402
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,389
collaborators called DPX technologies

403
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:52,730
that actually offers pipette tips that

404
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:54,889
have resin pre-packed in the tips so you

405
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,899
can do extractions in the pipette tip

406
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:59,000
you don't even have to use other sources

407
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,500
of lab where you basically pipette it

408
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,269
into the tip and you can do some mixing

409
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,940
in the tip and do a cleanup for example

410
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,919
just right there in the tip so these are

411
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,980
huge time savers these are these are

412
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:11,689
cost savers and they eliminate a lot of

413
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,539
manual intervention and a lot of these

414
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,920
workflows and then genomics we've heard

415
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:18,110
some some awesome talks here about

416
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,110
really the power of genomics and how

417
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,639
that's gonna increase and how that's

418
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,529
gonna actually take to the next level I

419
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,009
think cannabis as a medicinal product

420
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:30,259
when you can dial in strains that are

421
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:31,970
going to be exactly what you need to

422
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,549
treat your symptoms so we've worked with

423
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,320
medicinal genomics and also cordage in

424
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:38,089
you know an automating some of their

425
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,760
kits having their kits available on our

426
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:43,280
platforms to really just at the end of

427
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,379
the day you load up your samples on the

428
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,639
robot and you click go and you can do

429
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,850
some of these genetic profiling

430
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,399
microbial contamination tests plant sex

431
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:56,629
strain identification really really walk

432
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,490
away solutions so I'm going to wrap up

433
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,070
here by kind of putting it all together

434
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,779
so the point of automation is you know

435
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,390
really there's there's a couple points

436
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,029
to make the speed and accuracy

437
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,070
definitely are things to think about

438
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:11,809
from a laboratory perspective plan for

439
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,490
demand growth because I'll just give you

440
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,019
an example in the state of California

441
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,700
right now it's estimated that it

442
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:18,289
probably like five to six percent of the

443
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,680
cannabis samples are actually tested in

444
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:23,389
labs well in 2018 eight months from now

445
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,880
that's going to be mandated a hundred

446
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,400
percent so that's a 20-fold increase in

447
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,220
sample throughput and it's going to be

448
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,190
very difficult to handle the point is

449
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,720
automation has to be in the labs and I

450
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,549
think it's very important for labs to

451
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,380
consider it now or maybe not necessarily

452
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,759
they they don't have the sample

453
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,200
throughput but they're going to be hit

454
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,670
with it soon and you want to be familiar

455
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,240
with the automation aspect

456
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:49,130
now before before you have four thousand

457
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,019
samples backlogged and you have people

458
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,930
screamin at you from you know from every

459
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:56,150
end and and really some of the things

460
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,680
that I talked about the you know the dry

461
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,000
labbing things like that the scandals

462
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,590
when you have automation you have data

463
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,240
tracking you have validation you have

464
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:04,250
you have things that protect consumers

465
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,930
at the end of the day to prevent things

466
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,940
like that from happening if you can go

467
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,769
back and have a data trail an audit

468
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,170
trail to show that things were actually

469
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:14,829
tested I mean you you can't fight you

470
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:17,539
know you can't fake that and

471
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:20,929
reproducibility is key in this industry

472
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:23,629
and we we're gonna see a huge demand I

473
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,100
think in the near future so Hamilton's

474
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,080
here we have the experience and just

475
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:30,709
just wanted to let you guys know kind of

476
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:32,419
who we are and what we do and just end

477
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,059
with a quote that I think really aligns

478
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,190
nicely from Joycelyn elders who's former

479
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,750
Surgeon General the US this is from 2007

480
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,309
you've probably read this the evidence

481
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,509
is overwhelming that marijuana can

482
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:43,429
relieve certain types of pain nausea

483
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:46,009
vomiting other symptoms caused by such

484
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:48,890
illnesses as ms cancer aids or harsh

485
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:50,269
drugs sometimes used to treat them it's

486
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,960
the same theme in the conference we know

487
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:55,759
it works we know it's a it's very

488
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,920
efficient in treating a lot of things

489
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,109
out there and ultimately Hamilton is

490
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,690
aligned with the cause we were concerned

491
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:04,129
about consumer safety you know we we're

492
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,730
here to push science forward so if we

493
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:11,650
can be a part of this whole movement we

494
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,650
well we're here so thank you

495
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:19,159
you
