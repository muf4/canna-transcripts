1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,318
good afternoon

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,699
my name is Hunter land I am vice

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,120
president of research and development

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:14,399
for BRC for those of you who don't know

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,919
BRC we're a schedule one research

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,699
facility and Manufacturing producer of

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,699
cannabinoids

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:29,039
I've been in research about 20 years 12

9
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,439
has been focused on cannabinoids and so

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,859
I picked up a couple disclosures along

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,859
the way

12
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:42,299
so today I've come to talk to you a

13
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,859
little bit about cannabinoids aging and

14
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,718
potential effects on neurological

15
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,960
diseases

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,179
start the start of this

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,759
it began with conversations with the FDA

18
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:57,238
around

19
00:00:52,759 --> 00:01:00,659
the CBD laws and how to effectively

20
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:03,238
determine a safe dose of CBD the FDA was

21
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:06,899
very interested in you know acutely

22
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,759
we're not seeing anything toxic but what

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,580
happens when you take this for long

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,680
periods of time potentially you know

25
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,959
decades and there's a it's very

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,200
difficult to do that type of work in

27
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,259
mammalian models rodents take years and

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,900
it's quite costly so one of the models

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,359
that is used for that is the C elegans

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,299
model we looked at CBD in this model

31
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,879
which I'll tell you about those results

32
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:35,340
can Abigail on that model as well and

33
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,280
then that brought us to well if we're

34
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,219
seeing this in healthy wild type what

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,118
happens in diseased models which brought

36
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,118
us to the town model

37
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,759
so why see aliens

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,060
um they do have the best characterized

39
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,219
genetics of any animal that we know a

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,500
lot of the metabolic signaling pathways

41
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,359
are conserved with humans they have

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,700
short life spans three to four weeks so

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,340
this is high throughput you can look at

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,819
a bunch of different compounds very

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,759
quickly cost effectively it's easy to

46
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,759
track life Movement we can do this with

47
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,340
AI and machine learning and as far as

48
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,378
toxicity and safety goes it's as

49
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,020
predictable as many mammalian models

50
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:25,500
it's kind of like the canary in the coal

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,080
mine approach just with nematodes this

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,020
models accepted the EPA likes this model

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,879
if we don't know exactly what's in let's

54
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,159
say contaminated water we don't know

55
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,799
what to test for we can determine if

56
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,840
it's toxic just by utilizing the C

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,760
Elegance model if they die quicker

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,378
probably don't want to spend much time

59
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,098
in the water you certainly don't want to

60
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:49,079
drink it same kind of application here

61
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:51,299
and it's also been used by NASA in the

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,980
International Space Station to kind of

63
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,260
determine what are the effects at

64
00:02:52,979 --> 00:03:01,318
atmosphere for long periods of time

65
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:04,679
so the first study we looked at CBD but

66
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:06,899
you don't see on this slide is the um

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,300
the initial study where we tried to

68
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,800
determine uh what the therapeutic range

69
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,400
was and that's done through thermal

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,159
tolerance and what we saw was the three

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,379
doses or the dose ranges were 10 40 and

72
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:22,679
100 micromolar or we weren't seeing

73
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:26,639
toxicity and actually potential some

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,980
some potential reduction in stress so

75
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,859
those are the the doses that we use for

76
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:35,179
this this particular lifespan model and

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,340
we did ultimately see increased lifespan

78
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,580
in in all three doses with the 40 micro

79
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,759
molar being the best in the extension of

80
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,580
approximately 18 in life span so

81
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,280
positive they didn't live forever but

82
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,319
it's roughly consistent with what you

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,318
would see with things like Resveratrol

84
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,738
or metformin again not compared in this

85
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:01,639
specific study but looks positive and

86
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,640
non-toxic

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,000
we also looked at movement which is a

88
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:13,199
which is an indicator of health and good

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
health and we again saw Improvement in

90
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,599
health Spain characteristics this

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,180
activity and um it was primarily in the

92
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,240
40 micro molar range and you can see if

93
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,120
you look at day 12 to day 15 the green

94
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,639
being the 40 micromolar you see that's

95
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,918
almost consistent with with what you see

96
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,418
in the normal healthy nematodes without

97
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:38,698
CBD at day 12 so again this is a sales

98
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,579
against mono but it would be great if

99
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:45,300
you know 80 year old humans acted more

100
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:48,478
like 60 year old humans so exciting but

101
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,540
again take it you know in the confines

102
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:55,879
of this model definitely positive and

103
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,879
potentially good in the wellness sector

104
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,679
so he moved on to Canada which has been

105
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:05,219
an interest of mine as well as many

106
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,360
others here for some time and we

107
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,400
actually found in the thermal

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,220
intolerance test that it was much more

109
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:15,258
well tolerated than CBD so if you notice

110
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:18,479
the dose range we have here 7.5 75 and

111
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,639
375 micro molar higher than what we

112
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,740
tested at CBD and that's because the

113
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,079
initial

114
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:28,620
toxicity wasn't seen with canaba Gerald

115
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:32,038
and again we see the the middle dose the

116
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,579
75 micromolar extending mean lifespan by

117
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:39,360
about 19 so again looks positive doesn't

118
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:41,758
look toxic uh good news we of course

119
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,900
shared this with FDA I'm not sure they

120
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,840
cared much but we did share

121
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:51,659
we also looked at Health span a bit more

122
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,179
variable in this particular model but

123
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,539
again the middle dose at day 15 we see

124
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,240
increased locomotor activity so again

125
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:01,918
another positive

126
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,740
cannaba Gerald seems to extend lifespan

127
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,519
at least in nematodes and health span

128
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,519
characteristics

129
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:17,579
so that brought us to well that's great

130
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,399
for the wellness category and for people

131
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:22,500
that may want to you know utilize this

132
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,258
as a supplement but what about in

133
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,300
diseases you know what what disease

134
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,600
model and C elegans has been accepted

135
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,100
and we landed on the Tau model of C

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,680
Elegance

137
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,419
um so so many for those of you that

138
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,939
aren't familiar with Tau I imagine a

139
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:41,159
list of you are but it is characterized

140
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,439
by these intercellular Aggregates of

141
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,660
this Tau protein and what that does is

142
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,319
it disrupts signaling it also affects

143
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,900
mitochondrial motility there's many

144
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,300
ramifications and we see this not just

145
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,000
in Alzheimer's dementia but also

146
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,120
traumatic brain injury epilepsy stroke

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,199
even cancer and some other specific

148
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,360
diseases even in instance of concussion

149
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,520
the the movement between the gray matter

150
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,439
and the white matter can stretch the

151
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:16,019
neurons resulting in increased Tau

152
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:18,120
expression so it is a problem we don't

153
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:20,459
know how much it causes the disease or

154
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,098
it's a symptom but it's definitely in

155
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:27,379
this model these nematodes don't live

156
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:27,379
nearly as long as their counterparts

157
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:36,719
okay so we use the style strain as BR

158
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,660
5270 and they have drastic reductions in

159
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,360
survival compared to Wild type the

160
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,880
design was we had a vehicle control so

161
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,680
just the

162
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,319
br5270 the towel C elegans

163
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,079
and then we had positive control of the

164
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,300
40 micro Mueller CBD so keep in mind

165
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,899
there's not really a great positive

166
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:01,020
control for Tau if we had that we would

167
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,758
probably treat a lot more diseases but

168
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:05,399
we didn't know that it was effective in

169
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,819
Wild type at life extension and Health

170
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,679
Plan Health span improvements so we've

171
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:14,120
stuck with this kind of optimal dose

172
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,120
that we found in the previous study

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,500
um as the exploratory test articles we

174
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,439
looked at we've been in partnership with

175
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,120
canerta so thank you kenarta for

176
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,519
providing the canned flavins because

177
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,399
those are difficult to produce and we

178
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,680
don't have them and also from informing

179
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,838
on study design as far as dosing and

180
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,360
concentrations are concerned as it

181
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,060
relates to canned flavins so the goal

182
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,080
here was to look at initially to look at

183
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:46,259
can flavins specifically at compared to

184
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,259
CBD so those were matched 40 20 and five

185
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:53,580
so 40 being the exact dose of CBD and

186
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:56,100
then 20 and 5 as as reduced doses or

187
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,139
exposures of canned flattens

188
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,620
then we looked at a Botanical drug

189
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:05,519
substance which contained at those

190
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:09,060
concentrations so 80 micromolar that is

191
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,580
CBD so that does not include the CBG

192
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,799
component and the THC component and the

193
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,259
other minor cannabinoids that are in

194
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,259
this Botanical drug substance so we can

195
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:21,778
essentially do a direct comparison at

196
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:26,338
the 40 micro Mueller group of CBD

197
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:29,399
isolate versus CBD BDS plus the other

198
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:33,120
constituents and then at 20 would be

199
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,159
roughly half the CBD exposed as the

200
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
control group and then lastly we

201
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,980
combined them all so we said what

202
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:44,159
happens when you combine CBD CBG Delta 9

203
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,200
THC the miners and camoflavins versus

204
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,139
the isolate so really trying to figure

205
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,600
out is there some rational polypharmacy

206
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,819
is there this Entourage effect or is it

207
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,560
more of a non-trage effect which you can

208
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,720
see in some models and with some

209
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,719
compounds

210
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,300
and this was completed in triplicate

211
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,120
so first we looked at the cam flavins

212
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:08,599
and you can see the separation so if you

213
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,980
look at the the brown and the orange

214
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,180
that's clearly separating from the

215
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,800
control the the green and then once more

216
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:19,019
from the purple so you see this nice

217
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,379
Trend again they're not living forever

218
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:25,320
but they don't live very long so

219
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:29,278
when you move into the t-test you can

220
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:32,459
see the control CBD at day 16 that's at

221
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:35,220
Lower Blue Bar you see that's about four

222
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:39,059
percent survival so pretty pretty poor

223
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:42,240
outcome if you're a br2 br 5270 C

224
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:46,139
elegans and you don't get anything CBD

225
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,419
about double a nice Trend but not as

226
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,179
good as what we see can five and so on

227
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:54,719
so again we've got 40 micromolar cam

228
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:57,838
Flavin looking Superior to CBD alone and

229
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,560
20 micromolar cam 11 again Superior to

230
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,560
CBD alone

231
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,779
we moved on to look at the same group

232
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:10,859
but with the Botanical drug substance so

233
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:13,379
this is CBD CBD and Delta 9 THC versus

234
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,079
CBD versus control

235
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,899
you see this nice Trend and kind of this

236
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,419
early bump in survival at day eight so

237
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,539
looking very positive

238
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:28,620
and as you move into survival and again

239
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:32,879
back to the t-test you see 22 percent

240
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,720
survival and 19 at 80 and 40 micro

241
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,980
molars so again about double

242
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,220
a little bit more than double in the 80

243
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,920
micro molar but almost double at a match

244
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,740
CBD dose and still once again even

245
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,399
better at the 20 micro molar so again

246
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,680
positive positive both at day 12 and day

247
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,860
16.

248
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,679
so finally we looked at the canned

249
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,440
Flavin plus the Botanical drug substance

250
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,599
we again see elevation early on day

251
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,380
eight a little bit better than what we

252
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,720
saw with CBD BDS on its own and

253
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:13,620
certainly better than CBD and that Trend

254
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,560
continues throughout the study

255
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:19,139
as we move into this overall not seeing

256
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:22,859
at day 16 not seeing significantly

257
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:25,919
better survival than we saw with just

258
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,778
the Botanical drug substance although we

259
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,439
do see some improvements kind of midlife

260
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:34,740
so if you look at that day 12 56 versus

261
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,519
39 pretty much across all dose groups

262
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:41,700
very positive and again even the 20

263
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,679
micromolar dose at 14 survival is better

264
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,680
than 10 and certainly better than four

265
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,699
so about three to four fold higher

266
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,699
survival levels

267
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,980
the last thing that we looked at was

268
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,199
activity levels it was

269
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,659
um quite difficult to examine activity

270
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,440
levels because

271
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:06,778
these nematodes were so

272
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,519
entangled with Tau so to speak so we

273
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:10,559
didn't really see very much the only

274
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,019
thing that we we saw in terms of

275
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,059
positive was that day eight with the

276
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:18,320
camflaven so we saw a little bit

277
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:21,359
increase the statistical increase in

278
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,180
motility at day eight we didn't see it

279
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,879
with CBD we didn't see it with any of

280
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,979
the Botanical drug substance but on a

281
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,799
positive note we didn't see the sedation

282
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,560
or we didn't see lack of activity which

283
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:37,319
you know the cliche would be that maybe

284
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,539
stoned CL against don't move around as

285
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,760
much but we didn't see that so we didn't

286
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:44,519
see toxicity we didn't see decreased

287
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,338
activity in only a slight increase with

288
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:50,000
Cam Flav in that day

289
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:52,200
and unfortunately

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,958
there's kind of a rule of thumb that

291
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,300
I've I've come up with working in with

292
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,699
cannabinoids even if your schedule one

293
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,979
DEA facility and you're working with a

294
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,639
partner that has a schedule one license

295
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:09,120
and it should be really easy to send 25

296
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:12,060
grams of THC to them it still takes

297
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,959
three months for the DEA to add a

298
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,299
protocol

299
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,819
and for you to be able to ship the the

300
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:21,240
product there so what I've shared today

301
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,339
is preliminary data we are looking to

302
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,680
see specifically

303
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:30,000
um if there have been changes in the the

304
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:32,039
amount of Tau in the the C elegans and

305
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,200
um we have plans to to do further

306
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,659
research with this data set just that

307
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,980
information is not available yet so

308
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,399
thank you

309
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,399
thank you

310
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,419
tutor that was really interesting I'm

311
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,839
sure one of the questions that come up

312
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:51,958
these concentrations seem high can you

313
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,540
provide a little translation for us

314
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:58,319
about whether these are achievable

315
00:14:54,539 --> 00:15:01,500
levels say in a mammal uh or what the

316
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,180
comparative dosing might be so a great

317
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,860
question Ethan so these are the

318
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:07,338
concentrations are actually delivering

319
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,220
living environments so they're consuming

320
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:12,600
essentially the bacterium the E coli

321
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,579
that is exposed to this so they're

322
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,639
consuming CBD so the actual

323
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:19,799
intracellular levels are not this high

324
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,259
it's much more consistent with what we

325
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,659
would get so about the 80 micromolar

326
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:27,778
would be consistent with exposure in the

327
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:30,958
epidiolex trial at 20 makes per kick so

328
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:34,500
as you go down you have about half that

329
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:37,138
at 40 and again further reduced at 20.

330
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,958
um it's not exact but that is the best

331
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,339
way that we've been able to kind of come

332
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,500
up with the

333
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,339
correct physiologically relevant

334
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,539
concentration so again not quite like

335
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:51,720
oncology studies where you're looking

336
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:54,539
these super high exposures that is it

337
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,000
does tend to mimic more whole organism

338
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:59,659
real life kind of situation

339
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,659
thank you

340
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,799
okay

341
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:07,338
all right thank you very much

342
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,338
thank you
