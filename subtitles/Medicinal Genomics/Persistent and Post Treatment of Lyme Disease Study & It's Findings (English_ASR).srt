1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,629
[Music]

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:21,760
y so your your study looked particularly

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,759
at persistent and post- treatment Lyme

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,400
disease well yeah so we call it that

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,840
because um in the the from our uh so a

6
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,839
couple things one is I didn't want to um

7
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,079
allude to the fact that one should treat

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,680
acute you know like an acute case with

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,600
just cannabis but also um in the data

10
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,000
set these are people that are are you

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,960
know filling out a form saying I have

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,079
Lyme disease so I don't know what stage

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,000
they're at um but so uh it's that's

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,399
seemed like a large enough grouping this

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
it's kind of safe to assume that that

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,160
they're either treating persistent cases

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,480
or post- treatment but there's no reason

18
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,398
that some of them couldn't have been

19
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,038
acute it's just unlikely if they're just

20
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,879
in that short treatment window of two

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,760
weeks on doxy cycl that they would enter

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
this world of treating it with cannabis

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,680
right yeah right the symptoms that we're

24
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,519
tracking like anxiety inflammatory pain

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,680
sleep those kinds of things are are

26
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:19,239
common in the later stages of life um

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,680
and again if you're treating it with

28
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,239
cannabis you've probably already been

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,840
through the standard round these are

30
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:27,039
those are assumptions that but we can't

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,000
interview these these patients so we're

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
really just looking at they say they

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,759
have lime

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,439
and they're treating X symptom and um

35
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,719
and the tool helps them rate it on on

36
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:41,679
different scales so what's interesting

37
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,399
though as as ubiquitous as lime is as

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,840
much as cannabis is being looked at

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,718
nobody had ever looked at these two

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,600
together before um and if you which is

41
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:54,559
really surprising because if you do a

42
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,759
just a simple Google search there's a

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,439
lot um where every dispensary is telling

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,359
you you should treat your lime disease

45
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,519
with canab

46
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,438
and lots of lots of doctors websites

47
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,519
have you know blog posts about using

48
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,439
cannabis to help with Lyme disease and

49
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,560
lots of lime blogs and and lime

50
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,639
information websites tell you CBD and

51
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,000
cannabis are good symptomatic treatments

52
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:19,919
but absolutely nobody has done any

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,280
academic or formal uh look at it until

54
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,719
now which is really weird um and you

55
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,680
know we're doing a retrospective sort of

56
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,199
naturalistic study um and we're

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,920
continuing to examine more symptoms and

58
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:36,919
and kind of parse out the data um

59
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:40,799
because it really is effective and and

60
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:45,199
it's interesting that it affects people

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,800
so the things that lme people sorry Lyme

62
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,560
diseas is often a root cause of things

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,080
like

64
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,800
rheumatoid

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Ms ALS it can be mistaken for

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Parkinson's um if for Lupus

67
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,239
fibromyalgia these are all things people

68
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,199
commonly use cannabis to treat right so

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,120
very so and they're not always caused by

70
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,719
lime but lime is one of the potential

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,920
causes of these syndromes um and so that

72
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,239
was very interesting to me too um and so

73
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,199
what we found though is that people who

74
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,480
like use it for arthritic for

75
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,280
inflammatory pain if they have lime

76
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,959
respond differently than people who are

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,878
using it for inflammatory pain who don't

78
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,840
have

79
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:33,239
them uh same thing with anxiety how so

80
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,239
so like higher THC formulations were

81
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:41,319
found um more relieving for anxiety than

82
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,080
mixed Ceno ratios um with in people with

83
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:44,839
lime whereas when we look at overall on

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,680
the other end it's usually the other way

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,640
around like a one: one or a high higher

86
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,400
CBD ratio Formula will be better better

87
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:55,798
for lime uh for anxiety I see so the THC

88
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,480
is more helpful for lime because it's

89
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,319
better at relieving inflammation right

90
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,840
got it and or and so it's interesting so

91
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,399
there's a lot I mean when we talk about

92
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,920
the data there's a lot I can I can say

93
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,239
about that it's pretty interesting yeah

94
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,679
let's talk about that I mean first of

95
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,039
all you know where where are you getting

96
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,720
this data like how yes where's it coming

97
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:20,680
there's a there's a great um uh app and

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,680
website called strain print uh strain

99
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,439
print.css track a fair amount of

100
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:31,439
American Products as well so it's a

101
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,519
really great um uh use tracking

102
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,038
tool um

103
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,359
so um and I so I suggest to people

104
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,000
regardless because it's helpful because

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,400
you know you might say say you use you

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,918
use and you find oh my Pain's really

107
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,599
relieved but it also then will ask you

108
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,639
are you feeling tired are you feeling um

109
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,400
you know a irritable or upset stomach so

110
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,120
helps you note side effects as well and

111
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,758
help dialing so kind of help dial in

112
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,079
your dosing that way um but it asks

113
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,720
people to identify their disease or or

114
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,800
diagnosis and then it'll give a list of

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,000
symptoms commonly associated with those

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,960
but then you can also choose your own it

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,560
tracks up to like 70 different symptoms

118
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,239
that's a lot um and then uh you rate it

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,600
how you're feeling on a scale one to 10

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,560
before you put in what you took and then

121
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,639
and then rate after and so he's got for

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,160
if you're in Canada for example all the

123
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,759
products in dispensaries are loaded into

124
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,520
that app so it tracks all the testing

125
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,120
data and stuff like that so it's also

126
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,758
useful for producing ERS and and looking

127
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,600
and studies to say you know what

128
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,439
cannaboid ratio might be good for this

129
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,560
Sal and that sort of thing so that

130
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,439
that's it's interesting that way so

131
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,560
we're able to track a lot of

132
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:46,918
different um ratios of uh products that

133
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,918
people used um and in this one we were

134
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,038
now is that down to like the batch level

135
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,519
too yeah yeah yeah if if it's a company

136
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:56,560
that's regularly submitting their stuff

137
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:59,159
yeah yeah that's awesome um yeah and so

138
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,560
it's it's it's it's useful in oh so many

139
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,479
ways it's really cool right um so the

140
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,399
the um we looked at a a combined of

141
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,038
inhaled and edible products so we kind

142
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,519
of put it all in one but it would be

143
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,478
interesting to parse that out in the

144
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,038
future um and we looked at a range of

145
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:20,800
cannaboid ratios of including THC only

146
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,120
CBD only and then naturalistic ratios so

147
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,879
you might in the data you might see like

148
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,759
a 25 to one that's that's a very high

149
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,719
THC um cannabis but it's still a

150
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,160
naturalistic ratio so it's got some meas

151
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,000
able amount of THC CBD and other

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,000
cannaboids in there but we're really

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,959
just looking at THC and CBD as well and

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,360
which is something I think is often not

155
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:46,000
enough but it's what we have more often

156
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,400
than not um and uh and going all the one

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,279
to one and on the other end of things um

158
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,279
and what we found in this data set was

159
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,839
there was an overwhelming preference for

160
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:59,638
THC very very strong preference and and

161
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:03,279
very high in the THC only

162
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,560
I note that to a product availability um

163
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,119
what's what's pushed in dispensaries you

164
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,000
know there's a higher margin in

165
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,240
distillate in in for some in some way

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,160
sometimes so um and then the convenience

167
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,360
factor um there as well so I think

168
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
that's part of it and then that's also

169
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,840
primarily what's in Edibles right they

170
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,800
use distill in Edibles as well because

171
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,519
then they can have an even measure of

172
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,800
dosage even though it may not be the

173
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,639
best delivery method so while that was

174
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,840
used the most most often not in every

175
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,079
case was it the most preferred but it

176
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,679
always scored very high um but when you

177
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:43,758
when you look at other ones what often

178
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,680
scored equally High um and uh or better

179
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,520
with

180
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:52,478
less dosages um uh was naturalistic

181
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:57,839
ratios or one to one um CBD only often

182
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,839
also didn't perform very well in general

183
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:11,918
