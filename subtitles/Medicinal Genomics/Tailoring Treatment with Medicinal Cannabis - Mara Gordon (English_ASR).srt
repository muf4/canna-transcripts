1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,839
i'm very grateful to be here thank you

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,519
so much for i know it's been a long day

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,320
everybody yawn stretch

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,679
take a second to increase your energy a

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,599
little bit here

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,519
i'd like to start out by telling you

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,640
just very very briefly what brought me

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,600
to cannabis

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,760
and it was chronic pain i was a patient

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
initially myself i had had bacterial

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,480
spinal meningitis that left me on 26

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,920
pharmaceuticals in a wheelchair on

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,600
fentanyl patch neurontin many many many

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,160
other horrible medications

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,840
now i'm on three and cannabis i will

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,439
tell you right now that i'm a huge

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,800
proponent of pharmaceuticals when

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,399
they're used correctly

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,238
but i think that our doctors and our

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,039
medical community can do a lot better

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,519
job

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,480
of figuring out ways to treat people

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,480
using

24
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,479
integrative medicine and not just going

25
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,959
to their pdr to pick the next drug

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,479
and adding one on top of another so i

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,239
think i'm a testament to the fact that

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,279
i'm standing here instead of rolling up

29
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,159
the aisle

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,558
and able to talk to you coherently and

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,118
not

32
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,158
be drooling and nodding like i was on

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,079
the opioids

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,600
so thank god for cannabis in addition

35
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,079
i'm very very excited about the work

36
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,199
that cordogen's doing in particular

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:19,200
because i come from a family of

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,960
you're pretty well if by the time you're

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,880
60 you'll have been diagnosed with one

40
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,359
form of a cancer or another

41
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,039
and there's still using the same types

42
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,319
of treatment protocols they were using

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,920
in the 70s

44
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,679
the 80s the 90s the arts etc

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,200
and there's got to be other ways or at

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,560
least ways to bring cannabis in with

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,478
some of the results we're seeing

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,759
i know that the conference topic is

49
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,679
primarily

50
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
looking at neurological disorders but if

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
you'll humor me i'm going to talk just a

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,118
little bit about

53
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,319
cancer here because i think that it's

54
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,280
something that's not nearly

55
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,118
addressed enough and i've just been

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,719
having some casual conversations here

57
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,718
with some

58
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,399
attendees some doctors they said you

59
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,559
mean you use cannabis for the

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,439
side effects of palliative and i said

61
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
well that too

62
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,239
depending on the objective of the

63
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,438
patient but we also use it to kill

64
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,639
cancer

65
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,079
so so the question i'll be addressing is

66
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,519
can cannabis be consistently

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
inaccurately dosed

68
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,439
and the answer is hopefully clear from

69
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,120
the show okay so the first thing i want

70
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,000
to talk about is the fact that

71
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,640
we do in fact promote whole plant

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,039
extracts and not isolates

73
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,958
isolates do in fact have a role for

74
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,840
standardization of medicines if you have

75
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,719
whole plant

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,719
and let's say you're trying to

77
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,680
standardize something to 60 milligrams

78
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,439
per mil

79
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
and it's coming out your your whole

80
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,159
plant extract somewhere at 55

81
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,000
57 58 there's nothing wrong with using

82
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,199
an isolate to help to standardize to

83
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,039
bump up the numbers

84
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,560
but you have to have the entourage

85
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,000
effect you have to have the synergy

86
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,080
between the terpenes

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
the flavonoids everything else that's in

88
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
the plant in addition to the

89
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,599
cannabinoids that are in there and even

90
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,679
the cannabinoids working together

91
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,119
have a synergistic effect we know that

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,439
mercine which is

93
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
an old hippie trick of eating mango

94
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,840
before you got high and it got you

95
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,518
higher

96
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,360
and now we know of course the reason for

97
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,039
that is that mercine helps to

98
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,640
increase the bioavailability and break

99
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,639
through the blood-brain barrier

100
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,399
limonene something that's in limes gives

101
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,958
a much more uplifting

102
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,480
experience we know enough about the

103
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,598
terpenes now to know

104
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,799
which ones work best with certain people

105
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,639
and certain diseases

106
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,239
but the one the thing a recurring theme

107
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,279
that you've heard here today over and

108
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,840
over again

109
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,919
is that there is no one-size-fits-all

110
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,920
one terpene might make me very sleepy

111
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,158
and it might make somebody else very

112
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,958
very activated so you have to work very

113
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,039
closely

114
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,360
in communication with your patients to

115
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,000
find out immediately getting feedback

116
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,640
with what works for them

117
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,158
now the entourage effect is you know if

118
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,839
they've identified i hear

119
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:51,519
sometimes i hear 200 different terpenes

120
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,080
100 different cannabinoids sometimes

121
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,680
i've seen reports that said 400 terpenes

122
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,000
i don't know the answer to it i'm not a

123
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,319
scientist i'm actually an engineer

124
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,039
so i come to this from a background of

125
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,798
data

126
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,560
and wanting to see patterns and wanting

127
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,438
to see what's working and what's not

128
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,640
working and

129
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,400
take track you know looking and

130
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,359
analyzing these things and looking for

131
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,879
the patterns

132
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
but i can tell you that with all these

133
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,399
various combinations i tried to run the

134
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,798
formula last night

135
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,439
of how many various combinations if you

136
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,399
just had

137
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,160
two compounds present in any plant and

138
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,039
you took the hundreds of cannabinoid

139
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
potentials

140
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
and the hundreds of terpene potentials

141
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,680
and you

142
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,680
added them together and you figured out

143
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,720
which plant headed it's a pharmacy and a

144
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,400
plant i mean

145
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
every different combination will give

146
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,159
you a different effect slightly

147
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,599
variance depending on who's taking it

148
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
and how it's going to impact them of

149
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,360
course

150
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,478
but it is in fact a i tell people have

151
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,520
an infused

152
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:48,800
uh cbd in your medicine cabinet have a

153
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,478
jar of uh of flowers

154
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,160
and then have an extract and you've got

155
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,120
pretty well a whole medicine cabinet a

156
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,840
whole pharmacy

157
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
in your in your bathroom now

158
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,918
this is a slide that i borrowed um with

159
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
her permission from dr christina sanchez

160
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,918
at completely university

161
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
where she talks about the mutation of

162
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,319
the cancer cells like what actually is

163
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
happening

164
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,159
when it goes through the process of you

165
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,560
know some not all but some most

166
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
cancer cells have go through the

167
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,360
angiogenesis process

168
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
and then they go through and they go on

169
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,479
and they metastasize and they spread and

170
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,199
go on to other

171
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,800
uh other parts of the body and then of

172
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,759
course that goes into the staging of the

173
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,079
cancers

174
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,120
but the traditional treatments are

175
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,879
designed

176
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,360
traditional chemotherapy treatments are

177
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,079
designed to work on

178
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,038
proliferating cells because your cancer

179
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,800
cells are

180
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,560
rapidly proliferating cells within your

181
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
body most of your cells are not

182
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,918
proliferating most of your cells

183
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,439
are pretty well stagnant i'm not a

184
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,719
scientist i'm not a doctor i can't

185
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,879
explain more than that

186
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
but i know that that's the understanding

187
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,439
as a result

188
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,360
your hair falls out because your hair is

189
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,038
continuously growing you're nauseous

190
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,960
you're vomiting because your stomach is

191
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,839
your your digestive system is

192
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,318
is a constantly active thing so cannabis

193
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,959
is found to work very very effectively

194
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,280
um against the things that we have here

195
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,239
like hair loss anemia constipation

196
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,959
diarrhea

197
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,400
pain joint pain is in in bone pain is a

198
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,599
very very big problem

199
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,638
with people that are going through

200
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,560
chemotherapies the toxicity

201
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,560
levels the canvas can help quite a bit

202
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,120
with and the lack of appetite

203
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,639
in addition lo and behold it also works

204
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,000
on the tumor progression

205
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,879
cannabis has been shown to be very much

206
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,319
significant

207
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,959
in apoptosis now the

208
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,000
cannabinoids or the cb1 or the cb2

209
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,879
receptors

210
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,639
are activated by the cannabinoids and it

211
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,120
begins the chemical cascade

212
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,918
that results in apoptosis everything in

213
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,360
between

214
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:52,159
the top where the i don't know where my

215
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
clicker excuse me

216
00:06:53,598 --> 00:07:00,079
everything that goes between here

217
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,400
and here is up to much smarter people

218
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,800
than me in the room to explain to you

219
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,719
i just know it does now i asked

220
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,680
christina i said dr sanchez i said could

221
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,360
you please explain to me

222
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,360
what is the difference between necrosis

223
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,919
and apoptosis because

224
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,840
they both end up with dead cells and she

225
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,120
said the difference is that necrosis is

226
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,598
like a car wreck

227
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,280
it causes a lot of damage the cells

228
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,360
cause damage to the surrounding

229
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,038
other cells and the tissues around it

230
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,879
which results in inflammation which

231
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,759
results obviously in a negative

232
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,879
prognosis

233
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,319
which is why they have to be very

234
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,399
careful with the speed at which they

235
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,000
kill cancer cells with chemotherapy so

236
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,719
that you don't have too much necrosis

237
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,399
going on

238
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,000
and causing too much other disease

239
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,799
they'll end up developing the body

240
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,519
where apoptosis is cell suicide which is

241
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,439
very

242
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,719
intimate experience it's very the cell

243
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,120
basically uh

244
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,759
collapses within itself and that's a

245
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,879
layman's

246
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,280
description and uh and and dies

247
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,039
leaving behind and being being captured

248
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,719
by the other healthy cells so that it

249
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,478
doesn't leave behind any residue which

250
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,560
causes any disease and problem within

251
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,839
the body

252
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
the second thing i want to and then

253
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,439
excuse me and also the id1

254
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,879
gene is something that dr sean

255
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,038
mcallister

256
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,520
has done work on looking at which

257
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,959
cancers that have id1 involvement id1

258
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,159
especially is a problem i was speaking

259
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,878
to one of the parents

260
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,080
last night you know because of the id1

261
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,680
which is something you see

262
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,120
in infants newborns and fetuses and

263
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,000
children it's something that's when you

264
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
have a lot of growth

265
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,079
going on the id1 is very involved

266
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,360
unfortunately it's also present

267
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:35,679
in quite a few different cancers the

268
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
the good news on that is that cbd is

269
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,120
seen to be to down regulate the

270
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,158
expression of the id1 gene

271
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,080
and the id1 is what causes when it's

272
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,319
present you're going to have a lot more

273
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
proliferation and metastasis of the

274
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,839
cancer cells

275
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,000
so when we look for certain cancers you

276
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,680
know we can go okay let's start out at

277
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
least like with a prostate cancer or

278
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,799
breast

279
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,120
cancer or something else and say okay if

280
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,000
we know that it's a non-small cell lung

281
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
for example

282
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,879
we might start out with a much higher

283
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,839
level of cbd and lower in thc than we

284
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,720
would in one

285
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,040
for example the majority of

286
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,959
glioblastomas

287
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,639
multi-form the gbms that we've looked at

288
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,319
have not had id1 because they've not

289
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,480
responded as well to the cbd

290
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,080
sometimes they do and so that's where

291
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,360
the experimentation and the not

292
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,800
being one size fits all comes into play

293
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,919
the second thing i'm going to talk to

294
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,838
you about today is chronic nerve pain

295
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,240
and thc has been shown it has five

296
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,160
mechanisms involved with pain reduction

297
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,159
the cb1 and cb2 activation

298
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,519
i can read this to you if you'd like me

299
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,120
to retards electro

300
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,879
chemical reaction at peripheral pain

301
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,240
receptors and i have had this explained

302
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,000
to me multiple times

303
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,159
interrupts pain signal at the dorsal

304
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,200
root ganglion interrupts pain signal

305
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,519
with the neuron

306
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,399
activation of cb2 at leukocytes triggers

307
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,320
anti-inflammatory response

308
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,000
much like a steroid would do and the

309
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
psychoactive euphoric effects and

310
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,120
short-term memory reduction mitigate

311
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,439
stress response to pain

312
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,600
now why this is really important is the

313
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,880
same way as dr mishulam says

314
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
that we don't want to walk into a

315
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,159
grocery store and remember 500 people's

316
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,838
faces that we see there

317
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,519
we also have the gift of forgetting it's

318
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,160
almost like having a break

319
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,959
or having a freedom from the suffering

320
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,159
that we have

321
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,639
it just gives us a break from it

322
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,679
anybody who knows anyone with ptsd and

323
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:27,278
they have this recurring fight or flight

324
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,838
response that's going on they have the

325
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,039
ability to have a break in that and have

326
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,040
the calm

327
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,799
and get out of that fight or flight and

328
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,759
it's the gift of the of the forgetting

329
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,278
that goes on

330
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,278
the cbd in this case works

331
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,439
anti-inflammatory mechanism

332
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,720
which works very much like a cortis

333
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,120
hydrocortisone

334
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,399
but with much much higher success rates

335
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
in many many cases

336
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,720
i tell you myself personally i was

337
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,959
having i have pretty severe asthma

338
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,480
and about once or twice a year i would

339
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,199
have to go on a

340
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,800
steroid as a result of every time i got

341
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
an airplane i got an upper respiratory

342
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,958
infection

343
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,879
you know it always attacks the weakest

344
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,639
part of the body and

345
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,639
i would have to go on to steroids and

346
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,000
then it would take me months and months

347
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,278
to get off of them

348
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
with extreme bone pain and all sorts of

349
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,519
side effects

350
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,440
i have not been on a steer steroid now

351
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,480
for over three and a half years

352
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,920
because of cannabis so

353
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,240
all right here's just a visual

354
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,958
representation of the nerve

355
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,919
okay so i want to show you how we do it

356
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,239
so

357
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,278
we started collecting data on patients

358
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,799
back into end of 2010 beginning of 2011

359
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,639
saying okay

360
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,078
nobody can tell you how to dose nobody

361
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,838
can tell you what's in the medicine

362
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,599
nobody can tell you how this works i

363
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,640
mean we went around to some of the best

364
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,879
places and the best

365
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,559
people and at the time there was like

366
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,159
you know they were beginning the testing

367
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,759
labs and they were still using gas

368
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,759
chromatograph to do

369
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,600
uh cannabinoids which of course we all

370
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,439
know it actually decarboxylates

371
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,278
in the process of testing it so it's not

372
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,399
an inaccurate it's not an accurate test

373
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,480
if you're really trying to know what

374
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,200
milligrams you're taking

375
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
you'd go to a dispensary and it would

376
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,680
have

377
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,599
a rice crispy bar and a piece of

378
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,439
cellophane that somebody stuck a piece

379
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,399
of masking tape on it and wrote

380
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,160
one to 20 doses whatever that meant

381
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,759
there was no labeling there was no

382
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,600
understanding so we said we're going to

383
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,120
you know we can do better than this

384
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,040
there's got to be a better way that's

385
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,078
when the engineer and me and the process

386
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:25,039
came into collecting the data we started

387
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,199
collecting about 300 different uh data

388
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,039
points with patients

389
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,959
and looking for patterns and what was

390
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,120
working for various diseases

391
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,799
and seeing what if we could find a way

392
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,720
to be able to predict

393
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,719
moving forward with somebody else based

394
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,320
upon various

395
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,399
different variables what was going to

396
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,839
work at what for which diseases

397
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,159
one of the interesting things that we

398
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,240
found was that

399
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,480
there's five questions that if we get

400
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,320
those five questions answered

401
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,680
we can do i mean obviously the

402
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,680
confidence level

403
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,519
in our results is going to be slightly

404
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,958
uh lower than it would be if we asked

405
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,039
300 data points

406
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,399
but we found that if we find a person's

407
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,799
age because

408
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,320
there's a uh i think you may have picked

409
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,319
up on a pattern of this today

410
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
there's definitely a correlation between

411
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,278
age and dose

412
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
the younger the patient the higher the

413
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,879
dose the older the patient the lower the

414
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,760
dose at least that's the patterns that

415
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,278
we've been seeing

416
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,799
so one of the most important things that

417
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,439
we look at is the age

418
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,838
then we look at the diagnosis of course

419
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
and

420
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,200
if it's a if it's a cancer whatever it

421
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,679
is we look at staging and everything

422
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
else

423
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,120
and other treatments that they're having

424
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,720
we look at all the pharmaceuticals and

425
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
supplements with the medications that

426
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,800
they're on

427
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,039
we also then look at their previous

428
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,000
experience with cannabis or cannabinoid

429
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,159
therapies

430
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,399
and then we look at what their objective

431
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:46,319
is because somebody might come to me

432
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,679
and say you know i've got breast cancer

433
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,120
and blah blah blah and so i'm

434
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,239
immediately thinking okay we're going to

435
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,600
put him on this we're going to put him

436
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
on that da da da we're going to start

437
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,159
killing the cancer

438
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,240
they just want to they just want to not

439
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,879
be nauseous and now you know what that's

440
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,600
their right

441
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,039
it's not up to me to tell them what

442
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,320
their goal should be with their with

443
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,319
their treatment that's a

444
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,839
discussion between them and their doctor

445
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,519
and frankly we want to put this back

446
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,120
into the hands of the doctor so we've

447
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,360
been developing a software

448
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,519
all these years it's a cdr med it's now

449
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,440
in alpha it's moving into beta

450
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,278
in fact i think the site just went up

451
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,760
again last night

452
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,439
to be moving into beta to help to make

453
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,958
it a conversation that a physician can

454
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,320
be having now with his

455
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,159
patients instead of having to have

456
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,600
somebody like me doing it i'm not

457
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,039
qualified

458
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
so the first patient i'm going to look

459
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,439
at here was a 43 year old female

460
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,120
that came to us with breast cancer stage

461
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
4

462
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,759
and her goal was killing cancer cells

463
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,120
that was absolutely she wanted to live

464
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,919
and she was going to do whatever it took

465
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,959
to

466
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,240
to live so uh the first recommendation

467
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,879
that we made to her

468
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,120
now this was this was a while ago was

469
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,958
150 milligrams of thc

470
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,198
and 75 milligrams of cbd now

471
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,879
when i say this is our first people want

472
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,958
to know where they're going in their

473
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,439
treatment they may not ever get there

474
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,439
or they may have to go way past it but

475
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,680
this is a starting out goal

476
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,839
we can make adjustments we start people

477
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,838
out on a third of a milligram

478
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,920
we've standardized our infused oils at

479
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,880
10 milligrams per milliliter

480
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,719
and it's between 28 and 30 drops per mil

481
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,838
which means that each drop is one third

482
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
of a milligram

483
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,760
and that way if we can start somebody

484
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,120
out and we can tell very very quickly

485
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,799
how high we're going to have to go

486
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,440
before we start having a therapeutic

487
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,198
effect

488
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,880
of course our extracts are much much

489
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,799
higher and we're getting ready to move

490
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,159
them into standardized as well

491
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,519
at i believe 30 60 and

492
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,000
i'm not sure if there's another one in

493
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,720
there not milligrams per mil

494
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,480
of major cannabinoid so this was the

495
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,000
first one the doctor recommended

496
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,480
150 milligrams taken in two doses

497
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,839
and then the cbd we also recommend that

498
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,519
people separate out

499
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
their major cannabinoids and not take

500
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,919
them together when they're doing cancer

501
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,759
treatments

502
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,838
um cbd is a uh is an antagonist

503
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,519
and thc is an agonist so we want the

504
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,000
agonist in there doing its job

505
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,078
and and being effective and we and a

506
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,559
couple hours later you introduce

507
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,239
the cbd there's still synergy going on

508
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,399
in the body but in the meantime

509
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,278
we know that all the cb1s have been

510
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,278
activated

511
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,439
that need to be we also want there to be

512
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,000
beta-carotelline whenever possible

513
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,800
so that we have the cb2 activation as

514
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
well

515
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,198
so this was how we were able to do it so

516
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
how do we turn that recommendation from

517
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,439
a doctor

518
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,839
or from a or a clinician into results

519
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,800
based upon what's available right now

520
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,320
with the state of products so the first

521
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,198
thing we looked at was

522
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,839
lab results this one happened to be one

523
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,439
that was done

524
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,880
at steep hill hayland a long time ago it

525
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,040
doesn't matter the point is if you have

526
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,480
a good testing lab a good reliable

527
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,639
testing lab and that's kind of an

528
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,440
oxymoron unfortunately at this point

529
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,959
right now

530
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,120
because there needs to be a lot more

531
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,599
standardization and regulation

532
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,039
we recommend that uh people have their

533
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,199
their medicines tested

534
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,199
multiple times at multiple locations to

535
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,119
find out what really is

536
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,240
closest to accurate anyway in this

537
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,958
particular one

538
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:16,318
the thc had 650 milligrams per gram

539
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,759
of extract in the ac dc which was the

540
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:22,798
high cbd had 580. so

541
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,480
by eight we were able to then give them

542
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,078
from the sour cush keef which you see

543
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,640
here on this strain on the left and on

544
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,480
the right

545
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,640
we were able to then make a

546
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,360
recommendation to the patient to take

547
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,360
this

548
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,639
instructions on how to actually take

549
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,038
this medicine

550
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,799
correctly in order to achieve the exact

551
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,679
150 milligrams

552
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,558
that was being recommended by the doctor

553
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,840
okay

554
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,319
the second thing we're able to do we're

555
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,798
able to repeat it again and again

556
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,439
and again then the person was in

557
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,000
remission

558
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,798
we were able to move to a maintenance

559
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,839
dose

560
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:58,240
of 100 milligrams of cbd at this point

561
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,519
and only 50 milligrams and what we do i

562
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,640
asked her the question asked to the

563
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,079
panel earlier

564
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,280
that we said that if after a person goes

565
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,480
through two full

566
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,399
cycles of showing any d then we will

567
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,679
then reduce them to between 10 and 12

568
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,640
percent of what they're ever their

569
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,000
highest

570
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,840
that's the goal to go on for a

571
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,759
maintenance dose

572
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,038
it looks like i talked too much at the

573
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,079
beginning so i'm not going to be having

574
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,679
a chance to show you

575
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,199
but this is how we then ended up were

576
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,559
able to achieve the

577
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,759
maintenance dose for this patient

578
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,918
and then this is just showing the

579
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,879
patients what they took throughout their

580
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,559
uh the whole treatment protocol and how

581
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,760
they were able to consistently take the

582
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,678
medicine through this

583
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,679
on the chronic nerve pain i just take

584
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,038
one minute very quickly to show you

585
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,798
we had to go through a lot of

586
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,038
experimentation with this particular

587
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,599
patient we did it with the cannabidiol

588
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,558
excuse me the the thc first 25

589
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,079
milligrams

590
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,639
very very quickly the patient just

591
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,119
zoomed right past that to a hundred

592
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,640
and that still wasn't enough so we then

593
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,759
introduced

594
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,840
thc a into the picture

595
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,879
the thca because i'd rather want to have

596
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,079
that because they were having some

597
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
stomach issues

598
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,000
and we were able to dose that accurately

599
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
with these medicines fulfilling the

600
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,519
doctor's recommendation

601
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,839
then we brought in then cannabidiol

602
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,960
it turned out that a 80 milligrams of

603
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,399
thc

604
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,640
and 60 milligrams of of cbd was the

605
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
magic ticket for this particular patient

606
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,919
and we were able to

607
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,200
do it over and over again repeating that

608
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,880
to keep them the same one

609
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,640
if you'd like for more information you

610
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,600
can go to cdrmed.org

611
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,960
and ask for beta access i just you know

612
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,918
i think i've covered pretty much all

613
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,160
these things

614
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,840
we must have clinical trials it doesn't

615
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,798
need to be in the hands of people like

616
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,319
me

617
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,679
i'm glad that my software is going to be

618
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,759
able to put it into the hands for the

619
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,600
clinical trials and the doctors and all

620
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,038
but i'm very very happy to be here and

621
