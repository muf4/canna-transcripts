1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,480
thank you very much um good morning SL

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,518
afternoon um thank you for having me

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,039
here first time fall in love with camm

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,560
uh thank you for still being here we're

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:23,359
closing to lunch um I often hear people

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:26,640
saying that um nutrical and uh

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,560
cosmetical are the lower handing fruits

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,520
compared to medicine to drug is that

9
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:35,320
true absolutely if we talk about the

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,280
regulation we talk about uh the the

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,799
approve uh the the requirement for the

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,799
approval but I do still believe that any

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,159
good products um any good cosmetic

14
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,759
products dietary supplement products

15
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:52,319
should be supported by science rigorous

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,399
research especially with the ones that

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,159
has functional claims so I want to use

18
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,719
this opportunity to share with you the

19
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,558
research experience we have and I want

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,760
to share with you uh the promising data

21
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:09,118
the exite excitement I have towards the

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,600
development of nutriceutical or

23
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:16,159
cosmetical ingredient based on

24
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:19,879
non-cannabinoid uh compound from from

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,280
hemp all right most of the fundamental

26
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:26,118
basic research are done in in the lab in

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,560
my lab at University of Rhode Island um

28
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:32,280
some of them are supported by industry

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,478
Partners um uh from different companies

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,239
and I in addition to that I also have a

31
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:41,759
a startup very early uh stage startup

32
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,759
called Ocean State bioactives OSB to

33
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,879
further develop potential cosmetic or

34
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,280
nutriceutical products with different

35
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,118
natural

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:55,560
products um so in the past few years the

37
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:58,478
capacity at our University for cannabis

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,320
education and biomedical research has

39
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:05,200
been sign signicantly increased uh we

40
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,438
have a group fascinating awesome faculty

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,959
members that we do together on the

42
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:13,840
research of cannabis in addition to that

43
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,479
I lead a Research Unit that is

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,840
specifically focused on the potential

45
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:23,479
application of uh uh natural products on

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,920
their neutral and cosmetic uh

47
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:30,359
applications um sometimes I take a step

48
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:32,679
back thinking that this is not about can

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,480
this is not about hemp it's about any

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,599
natural products how do we use our

51
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:42,079
platform how do we rationally design

52
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:45,039
good products so comes to me it always

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,000
comes uh from two angles the strategy to

54
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,318
develop a natural products based neutral

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
or cosmetical ingredients are always

56
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:57,158
come from two angles of course one is

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,598
the chemistry uh especially the phyto

58
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:01,479
constituents of natural products and at

59
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:05,639
the second one is of course their

60
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:07,518
biological activities uh for hemp I feel

61
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,479
like this is very promising very

62
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,799
interesting especially for Di dietary

63
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:17,759
supplements and cosmetic industry why uh

64
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,719
think about the hemp root it's it's

65
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,560
sometimes called waste products from the

66
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,959
industry I feel that's B I think it

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,878
never need to be called as a waste

68
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,000
product it's a byproducts from the hemp

69
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:32,919
or cannabis industry but it has has a

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,239
great potential to be further developed

71
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,919
into neutral or

72
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,759
cosmetical uh another example is the

73
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:44,238
spend biomass to a lot of people it's

74
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:46,959
just spend waste material but as a uh

75
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,319
natural product chemist I think that one

76
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,840
the spent hemp material still has a lot

77
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,438
of bioactive compounds inside for

78
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,000
example this is another side project we

79
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,318
have we have extracted uh a lot of

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,479
bioactive compounds from spent hemp

81
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,399
material and especially for the

82
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,878
phenolics and the

83
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,438
polysaccharides those polysaccharides

84
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:14,000
are uh closely associated with a lot of

85
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:17,000
uh applications for dietary supplement

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
for example it it has been studied that

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,959
polyphenol are good for the gut health

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,800
uh especially as prebio U

89
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:29,399
prebiotics uh in addition to that we

90
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,840
have set up a library uh of cannaboids

91
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:37,159
and we use those cannaboids for our bio

92
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:39,439
acids uh we set up a in-house panel uh a

93
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,639
panel of In-House acid that could

94
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,918
evaluate the natural products in our

95
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,478
library uh the the the central of that

96
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,079
library and also for that bio acid

97
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:52,839
platform is inflammation and from

98
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,719
inflammation we can derive to gut health

99
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,839
we can derived to uh skin

100
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,120
Health um for today's talk I want to

101
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:04,560
spend some time on the on the background

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,280
of our research using CBD as a

103
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,639
representative compound from Cannabis

104
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:13,159
and I want to introduce you how we set

105
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,319
up our bi biological evaluation systems

106
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,319
for our further studies although the

107
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,560
focus for this talk is on non-c noise

108
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,360
type of compound but I do think CBD

109
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,399
could be a very good chemical Pro to

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,800
study those uh the the the chemistry and

111
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,000
biological activities of of this

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,840
compound then I will move to the

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,680
chemistry study of the hemp roots and

114
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:40,359
their anti-inflammation activity as well

115
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,959
as their skin protective

116
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,160
effect so I do want to spend some time

117
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:49,159
on the first part int introducing you uh

118
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,840
the the research we have done on CBD on

119
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,919
um cannaboids the reason is that uh most

120
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,038
of those studies are published I won't

121
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,318
go to Too Much details on this on the on

122
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,680
the data but I want to spend some time

123
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:05,360
on how do we set up those assets what

124
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,160
are the rationale behind the the

125
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,160
Publications share with you some of the

126
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,080
workflow some of the stories behind what

127
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,520
you don't you don't see from

128
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:18,359
Publications uh the first step we had

129
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:23,159
was that we set up a library of uh

130
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:26,720
cannaboids this include CBD and a a few

131
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,120
of those rear minor canab noids we have

132
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,440
about over 30 different um min canab

133
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,000
know it in addition to that we did

134
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,160
chemical modifications and we use

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,879
synthetic chemistry to build up another

136
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,840
separate Library as the CBD derivatives

137
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,879
as you can see here um many of them are

138
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,079
showing even better biological

139
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,719
activities in different

140
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,680
applications uh we have studied all

141
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,879
kinds of different biological activities

142
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,400
of minor canab noids this is for us is

143
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,759
kind of like we understand those

144
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,279
compound better and we understand the

145
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,960
bio acid system better just like machine

146
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,239
learning you feed the machine with data

147
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:12,478
and they can improve getting better

148
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,840
although we are not that fast but every

149
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,878
time we we carry on a study using

150
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,239
different natural products different

151
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,520
canab noids in different bio acids the

152
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,360
understanding of those bio acids and

153
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:29,079
chemistry are get profound and profound

154
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,199
every time so that's the the one um

155
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:35,159
starting point we we

156
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:39,520
had so here you can see initially we

157
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,520
test CBD in infl cellular inflammation

158
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,878
model specifically this is a

159
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,560
anti-inflam uh model I will give you a

160
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,960
little bit more details later then we

161
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,399
pivoted from the monoy the imuno cells

162
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:57,239
toward skin cells in this case we use uh

163
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,279
skin cinos site as the cell cellular

164
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,439
model and we can kind of like shifted

165
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:06,279
from the inflammation stress in the

166
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,759
monoy human monoy towards the

167
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:13,038
inflammation stress in skin models and

168
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,759
especially for uh inflammation mediated

169
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,680
cell death in this case is pyro

170
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,840
pyroptosis and we also study another

171
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,639
type of cell DES in skin cells which is

172
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,598
ferroptosis so this is the full cycle of

173
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,199
the de development the evolution of of

174
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,879
our bio acids uh let let me give you

175
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:36,000
some of the the details so the first

176
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,559
step is set up different bio acids uh

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,200
those bio acids include one biochemical

178
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:45,278
based acids could be enzymatic acid then

179
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,440
depends on different outcome or end

180
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:51,320
points we design cellular based acids

181
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,519
this is this is very important because

182
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,440
it helps us to understand uh uh uh the

183
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,240
mechanism of action of those canab noids

184
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,079
better then dep depends dep on if it is

185
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,039
necessary we can move to animal based

186
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:10,399
studies we can use different animal

187
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,399
models for different diseases models

188
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:17,360
um in parallel to that I feel very

189
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:20,159
excited that we also set up a new

190
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,800
platform that utilize more Advanced

191
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,879
Technologies such as proteom miix or uh

192
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:29,120
Advanced biing biing aets to understand

193
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,360
better the biological activity of Those

194
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,159
comp compounds as you heard from last

195
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,959
talk Hunter bring a very good point when

196
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:40,039
you do biological acids especially for

197
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,278
cell-based AES you see the statistic you

198
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:46,278
see the stars you know it's working or

199
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:48,639
not if it is the p uh uh less than 0.05

200
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:51,120
yeah sometimes it tells you if it's not

201
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,000
it's working or not but you don't see

202
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,039
the information the dynamic change from

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,360
the complexity of the biology behind the

204
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:03,120
values the the P values so that's why we

205
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,680
want to utilize more advanced technology

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,839
to understand better the mechanism of

207
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,759
action of those compounds as you just

208
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,360
heard from Dr goldenstein that uh

209
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:17,120
multiomic is is very uh uh rapidly

210
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,360
adopted by the the the the field study

211
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,200
the biological activity the mechanism of

212
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,278
action of cannaboids here similarly to

213
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,000
met metabolomics we have a platform

214
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,439
approach set up uh it's it's about the

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,639
proteomic uh to to look at the the

216
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,839
landscape of the change of proteins from

217
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:39,759
cells from animal tissues from human

218
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,760
biological fluid samples to understand

219
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:46,319
what's the impact of those cannaboids on

220
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:49,000
specific diseases models um in addition

221
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,320
to that we also set up this acid this

222
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,919
biing acid so once you have a specific

223
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,879
Target from the proteo mix you want to

224
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:01,120
validate if the compound can actually

225
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:04,320
bind to that MO ular Target in this case

226
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,759
we use a technique called spr surface

227
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,760
plasma resonance to confirm to validate

228
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:13,639
if the compound could directly bind to

229
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,639
the protein to the

230
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,240
Target um so we started the

231
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,360
anti-inflammation assd with this model

232
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,360
called inflammasome so what is

233
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,560
inflammasome and why it's important INF

234
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,120
flamon it's a group of proteins that

235
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:33,159
could be assembled for the purpose of

236
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,720
sensing infection stress so in the

237
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,600
normal status there are just proteins

238
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,759
protein group of proteins but when the

239
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,839
human body uh sense the stress from in

240
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:47,879
uh in infection those proteins they will

241
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:51,200
assemble together and the further uh

242
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:54,320
activate the downstream prote protein

243
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,079
secens for example they can activate one

244
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,920
pro one protein called caspace one which

245
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:02,799
is a very important uh enzyme that could

246
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:06,078
further activate the secretion of

247
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,159
pro-inflammatory cyto kindes such as ir1

248
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,399
beta so the point is that if you through

249
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:13,919
any natural products you more or less

250
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,159
see anti-inflammation activity very

251
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,078
general anti-inflammation activity if

252
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:21,159
you search a certain natural products in

253
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:24,479
in pop matat in Google Scholar you

254
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:26,759
always see it has inflammation activity

255
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,399
but sometimes inflammation is not bad

256
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:32,519
thing the root of all the diseases are

257
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,720
chronic inflammation and we found that

258
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,039
inflam is more path pathologically

259
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,639
relevant to inflammation to chronic

260
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:45,519
inflammation so we want to to set up a a

261
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:48,278
inflam inflam specific model to evaluate

262
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,519
our compound so how do we do that is

263
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:53,198
this is actually very straightforward so

264
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,759
in the general inflammation acid often

265
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:59,159
you do is that you uh you expose the

266
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:02,600
cells monoy microage to the inflammation

267
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:04,439
stressors like lipopolysaccharide uh RPS

268
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,199
then you measure the outcome you measure

269
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,880
the the biomarkers inflammatory

270
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:13,519
biomarkers in this case in addition to

271
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:16,639
LPS we add a signal sign secondary

272
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,919
signal which is known as nigeran so

273
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:24,440
after the the cells Expos exposure to uh

274
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:28,479
have exposure to uh LPS and Niger is set

275
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,720
up inflamation uh inflammation model uh

276
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,720
with this model we can screen the

277
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,040
library of our compounds and I found

278
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,680
that very interesting that we screened

279
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,719
over 300 different natural products not

280
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,919
only cannaboids many different natural

281
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,360
products only a few of them showing

282
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,719
specific selectivity towards the

283
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,680
inhibition of uh inflammosome in this

284
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:57,079
case CBD is one of those most promising

285
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,319
inhibitor for uh inflam so those are the

286
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:01,359
some of the details of the study which

287
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,240
are already published so I won't go to

288
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,639
too much but basically add the non-toxic

289
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,519
concentration to the celles CBD was

290
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,680
effectively effectively reduce the

291
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,320
production of i1 beta without affecting

292
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:19,519
uh TNA Alpha that's what how we can tell

293
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,240
it's a very specific inflam inhibitor so

294
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,078
after that we want to have more evidence

295
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,278
to support the

296
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:29,679
anti-inflammation activity of uh CBD so

297
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:33,198
we further develop different acid to

298
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,679
measure uh the the the receptor P2 X7

299
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:39,278
which is very important mediator for

300
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:42,439
inflam so we can say that using our uh

301
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,679
uh different uh uh photometric acids we

302
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,360
can show that inflam CBD could

303
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,679
effectively reduce uh the inflamation

304
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,079
level in the thp1

305
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:55,399
cells then we move to shift to uh skin

306
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:58,278
one the reason is that inflammosome is

307
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:01,519
actually very pathologically relevant to

308
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:03,559
uh man of those skin diseases acne and

309
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,879
even to aging so that's why we want to

310
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:09,319
say if that inflamm can uh the anti-infl

311
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,240
inflam activity of CBD could be

312
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,519
translated into skin so what we have is

313
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,440
that we have different bio acids set up

314
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:22,120
we can say CBD could effec effectively

315
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:25,399
reduce the uh the uh the cellular uh

316
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,000
oxidative stress in the skin U Cortino

317
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,639
Side High cells and we use g g uh uh

318
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,759
Gene plx AES to look at a panel of

319
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:37,360
different genes that relevant to inflam

320
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,720
and very interestingly we identifi that

321
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,360
caspace one the the one activate uh uh

322
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,759
uh i1 beta was actually identified from

323
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,959
this panel and which was supported by

324
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,480
our computational um uh analysis so

325
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:55,439
furthermore we tested the inhibition

326
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,920
activity of CBD on caspace one and

327
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,079
eventually we use spr technique to

328
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,838
directly measure The Binding Affinity

329
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:07,919
between CBD and CPAs one and all of

330
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:11,800
those are published data so cbase one is

331
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:14,519
the one that closely uh mediate the the

332
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:17,919
process of P pyroptosis which is

333
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:21,078
inflamation driven type of cell death

334
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,278
and we know that skin is more uh uh

335
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:27,359
prone to UV damage which is closely

336
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:29,799
associated with another newer type of

337
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,079
programmed cell death called ferroptosis

338
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:36,000
so what's ferroptosis it's a it's a a

339
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:39,318
programmed cell death and it's majorly

340
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,919
mediated by two biom markers one is the

341
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:45,078
ion level in the cells two is the lipid

342
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:48,240
peroxidation in the cells so our acid we

343
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:50,919
set up this a we expose cartinos side

344
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,799
cells to different inducers including

345
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:56,559
erastin which is a ferroptosis inducer

346
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,838
uh uh uh in this case and we use this

347
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:03,479
model to screen a whole liy of different

348
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,959
cannaboids CBD again very active and

349
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,439
there are more minor cannaboids that

350
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,439
work from more promising than CBD so

351
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,038
this is the data for CBD it could

352
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,720
effectively reduce the damage the cell

353
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:19,439
damage from erting and also reduce the

354
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,400
two most important biomarkers lipid

355
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,038
peroxidation and ion level in the cells

356
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,240
furthermore we use proteomic to take

357
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:30,000
look at the landscape of the protein

358
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,640
change in this process and we can

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,200
understand better what kind of like

360
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,160
proteins are involved in this uh skin

361
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,480
protective effect of

362
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,320
CBD and all of these are published data

363
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,038
if you have more questions I would more

364
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:46,200
than happy to answer them so after basic

365
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,279
research we still extended to kind of

366
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,840
like application research if you talk

367
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,960
about the dietary supplement you you we

368
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:56,599
we we in this case we measure the

369
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,840
stability of CBD in GI track and we also

370
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,158
study the skin penetration Capac

371
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,879
capacity of CBD using artificial

372
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:07,000
membrane based acids including Pampa

373
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,039
Francis division diffusion of those um

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,960
bio

375
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:16,079
acids all right to the next part is the

376
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,159
phytochemical investigation of hemp root

377
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:21,798
so this was very interesting if you read

378
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:25,080
Dr Russo's uh review paper on the uh uh

379
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:27,679
the Cannabis root which could be a

380
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:30,960
traditional treatment and also a future

381
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,720
treatment for pain inflammation so I I

382
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,279
was very interested in this this part of

383
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,640
this plant then I paid a visit to my

384
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:41,839
collaborators in China they're actually

385
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,320
the largest producers in China for hemp

386
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:47,158
and when I visit them I see just a

387
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,960
massive amount of root hemp root dumped

388
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,640
on the side of the road and they do

389
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,120
nothing about it they call it waste

390
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,679
products and they either either burn it

391
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,199
or just Landfield so for me as a natural

392
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,559
product chemist I feel pity because I

393
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,360
know there are so many good compound

394
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,000
goodies in this uh part of the plant so

395
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,038
what we did is a phytochemical

396
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,440
evaluation of this uh part of um plants

397
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,440
hemp Roots so U you can see I'm not

398
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,120
going to every compound that we have

399
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:20,279
isolated but you can see a part from uh

400
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:23,319
few cannaboids there's a large diverse

401
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:26,678
of bioactive compounds in hemp Roots the

402
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:29,439
CH the chem types of those uh uh

403
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,240
compounds are amazing you have phenolic

404
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,919
compounds you have TR turpins you have

405
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,079
phytosteroids you have fatty acids but

406
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,400
they are often overlooked in terms of

407
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:43,000
drug development but they could be very

408
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,480
valuable for neutral or kosutic

409
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,919
development uh just some highlight here

410
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,960
is that some of those compounds are

411
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,120
actually the first time that has been

412
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,919
isolated from hemp or from hemp Roots so

413
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,479
that's the chemistry we have done in in

414
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,400
in this part then we further took all

415
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,400
the isolate into the inflam inhibition

416
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,280
acid we first did the screening acid to

417
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,600
see their General anti-inflammation

418
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:12,279
activity then we test the uh the

419
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,319
cannaboids from from the roots and also

420
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:17,038
the non- cannaboids which showing

421
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,558
activity in the in the screening assd

422
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,879
showing testing if they have specific

423
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,720
anti-inflamm Activity one of those

424
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,120
compounds showing anti-inflamm activity

425
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,240
which is not a cannaboid type of

426
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:31,319
compound

427
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,440
so we took one more step further

428
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,720
although this one has been published but

429
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,480
we did one more step of study because

430
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,679
what we have missing is there are so

431
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,200
many different possibilities to get the

432
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,400
different type of compounds from uh hemp

433
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,960
root for example here we use different

434
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,798
extraction technology to further look at

435
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,840
the bioch uh the chemistry the

436
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:55,400
phytochemistry constituents from hemp we

437
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:59,959
you this one we were specifically

438
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:02,038
looking for alids from hemp roots

439
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,200
uh very interesting this is some

440
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:08,599
unpublished data this is our preliminary

441
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,519
result so we have fractionated those uh

442
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:14,199
extract from hemp roots and we further

443
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:17,319
generate uh the the the the fractions

444
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,080
the extracts that enriched in alids we

445
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:24,439
have so far four four fractions that has

446
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:26,918
uh enriched in uh uh alids and you can

447
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,159
see their anti-inflammation Activity

448
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,520
three out of the four has very good

449
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,400
anti-inflammation activity so that was

450
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,000
really triggered us we really want to go

451
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,000
deeper to see what kind of compounds are

452
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,880
responsible for this anti-inflammation

453
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,119
activity but if you think about the

454
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,080
aloid in hemp Roots you cannot forget

455
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:53,519
about this those compound called uh

456
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:56,038
canaban sativ those are the typical very

457
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,079
representative uh tative compounds from

458
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:00,839
hemp roots and that their Natural

459
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:03,678
Abundance in the root is very tiny it's

460
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:07,480
very hard to isolate those compounds

461
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:10,240
from from The Roots so now we have enr a

462
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,120
fraction that could have potentially

463
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,400
this type of compounds from the

464
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:18,639
preliminary data from the MMR from the

465
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,200
mass back uh uh hplc um uh TLC data we

466
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,080
have we suspect that there's one

467
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,440
fraction of those acoid enriched

468
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:30,319
fragment that is enriched in speron

469
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,960
which is uh uh the type of those type of

470
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,678
compound spermine which also showing

471
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,640
very strong anti anti-inflammatory

472
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:42,480
activity in our bio acids so our goal

473
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,240
our aim is to further look at what are

474
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,278
the chemicals in this fraction that

475
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,558
could be responsible for this um

476
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:52,599
anti-inflammation activity and if

477
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:54,960
there's a new compounds or more uh uh

478
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:57,719
representative compounds that could be

479
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,159
further used as the the the standards

480
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,038
for the future development of dietary

481
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,360
supplement or

482
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:09,079
neutral uh why the sperming is I feel so

483
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:13,038
excited about that many research support

484
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:15,639
that sperin is is a dietary uh dietary

485
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:19,119
compound could potentially affect the

486
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,000
longevity of uh uh human body and this

487
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:25,119
is supported by different type of um um

488
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,640
models animal models uh and uh it's

489
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:31,000
heavily associated with AutoPage which

490
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,840
is also a is and strateg for longevity

491
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,278
research uh and you can see now there

492
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,558
are already many this type of products

493
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:41,200
you can buy from Amazon and if you

494
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,519
search sper spermidine type of uh

495
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,480
supplements you can find many of them

496
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:49,278
but what I feel pity is that those type

497
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,000
of products more often you don't see the

498
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:54,640
standardization you don't know what what

499
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,038
exactly the spermidine type of sper

500
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,679
spermidine compounds are are in in the

501
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:02,759
bottle so there are so so lack of

502
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,200
research to support their potential

503
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,240
application their functional claims for

504
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,038
those type of supplements so I think

505
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,120
that's something we can do more about

506
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:15,079
this okay one last part is the skin

507
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:18,158
protective effect of compounds from hemp

508
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:21,599
Roots so again we go back to this

509
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,360
process in addition to isolate aclo from

510
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:27,240
hemp Roots we also look at phenolic

511
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:30,439
compounds and we were able to detect

512
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,159
this was only a detectable level so

513
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,600
meaning that the Natural Abundance of

514
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,520
this compound C leaving is very minor in

515
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,199
the hemp Roots so we were able to detect

516
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,440
it um and we did some biological

517
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,880
evaluations here too so what we have

518
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,320
here again we set up a cellular model

519
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,480
using a human Cortino site the skin

520
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,798
cells and we challenge the cells with

521
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,480
different oxidative stressors uh then we

522
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:59,319
extract the protein and analyze the the

523
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,360
proteo mix to see what kind of B markers

524
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:05,558
are related to this uh to this process

525
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,678
and this is a busy slides I'm not going

526
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:10,240
to the details but our

527
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,679
bioinformatics they share they they they

528
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,558
guide us to work through all those

529
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,759
biomarkers and constructed different

530
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:22,200
network to further explore the potential

531
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:24,960
biot Target and Pathways in this process

532
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,000
and from this large amount of data we

533
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,200
predict that flavinoids could be a

534
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,759
effect active compound that could be

535
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,360
used for the reduce the damage for for

536
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:39,278
the oxitive stress in the skin cells so

537
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:42,678
what we did was that we get canling a

538
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:46,159
and b we threw them into this cell based

539
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,640
uh acid for uh uh oxitive stress in the

540
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,720
skin cells and we did the biological

541
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,840
acid we were saying that at the

542
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,558
non-toxic level it could uh Camp living

543
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,480
A and B could both effectively reduce

544
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,440
the damage of the cells from from

545
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,558
oxitive stress it could reduce specific

546
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,278
biom markers that is uh related to uh um

547
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:12,038
oxitive stress in the in the in the skin

548
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:14,839
cells uh last part we also have the

549
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:17,200
mechanism of uh mechanistic study to

550
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,599
show that what could be the possibility

551
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,880
of those compounds in terms of reducing

552
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,119
inflame uh oxidation and also reduced

553
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,520
glycation in the skin cells and this

554
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,759
part has been published as well

555
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,759
so one last thought I want to share with

556
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:37,079
you is that when we talk about

557
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:40,079
development of a potential neutral or uh

558
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:42,319
cosmetical just like Pharmaceuticals CMC

559
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,639
is the last barrier for the drug to get

560
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:47,960
approved you heard about that from uh

561
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,559
the panel yesterday um so very similar

562
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:54,079
when you thinking of develop a neutral a

563
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:56,599
cosmetical ingredient from natural

564
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:59,439
products you always need to think about

565
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:02,398
Is it feasible it is commercially

566
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,240
possible uh even you have a lot of

567
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:08,079
strong rigorous data to support the

568
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,240
function in this case for example Camp

569
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:15,678
leaving C leaving a we were able to

570
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:20,679
isolate grams of campling from hemp hemp

571
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:25,360
Materia but this 30 G hempling was

572
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:27,440
isolated over from over 600 pounds of

573
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,158
the dry material so it's almost

574
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,278
impossible you can extract a fraction

575
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,399
from the hemp or from the root and

576
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:38,038
further use that for industrial scale up

577
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:40,199
it won't just be feasible so what could

578
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,679
be the Alternatives that we can produce

579
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,558
this type of compound as you just heard

580
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,919
the presentation before uh synthetic

581
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:51,119
pathway could be one route could be one

582
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:54,240
option to go so in this case OSB had a

583
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:58,879
collaboration with contract research uh

584
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:02,839
so we now establish the uh the uh the uh

585
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:08,399
organic synthesis of C fling a not only

586
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:11,599
canling a canl c flings a b c and ISO

587
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:15,599
flaven B so we were able to scale it up

588
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:18,199
to gram quantity in this case we scaled

589
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:21,158
uh those the production of those canling

590
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,399
in gram quantity which will enable us to

591
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:28,600
do further application research on on

592
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:30,439
the Cosmetic or neutural development so

593
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:34,359
this is what we have so

594
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:37,840
far okay just summarize here um we have

595
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:40,278
looked into the chemistry of cannaboids

596
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:43,119
we have looked into the chemistry of

597
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:46,720
hemp Roots we found that this is amazing

598
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:49,639
you have a lot a diverse group of

599
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,558
bioactive compounds from hemp roots and

600
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,600
there are so many potential compounds we

601
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:56,038
haven't even discovered them we don't

602
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,240
know what are they and they I believe

603
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:01,240
they do have the chance to further

604
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,079
developed into different neutral and the

605
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:07,919
data from the biological assay support

606
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:10,000
that support that that point so I feel

607
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,759
this is very promising in terms of

608
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,200
further development and that's exactly

609
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:18,640
why I think we should not rush it into a

610
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,399
products and sell the products this has

611
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,480
to be do more research about it toxicity

612
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:28,119
uh safety safety profile application

613
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,558
research formulation there are tons of

614
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:33,038
research we have to properly do do in

615
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,359
the right way to support its further

616
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:40,158
application as dietary supplement or

617
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:42,398
Cosmetics so that's um my last slide um

618
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,278
I know that I used all the time for the

619
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,398
presentation but I will be here all day

620
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,480
long so if you have any questions feel

621
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:52,289
free to come to me I would love to have

622
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,870
a discussion with you thank you so much

623
00:29:52,289 --> 00:30:00,769
[Applause]
