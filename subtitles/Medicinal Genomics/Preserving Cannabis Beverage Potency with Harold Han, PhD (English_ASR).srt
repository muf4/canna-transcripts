well my guest today is Dr Harold Han

24
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,280
Harold is Chief science officer and

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,079
co-founder of vertosa and a Pioneer in

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,400
water compatible cannabinoid ingredients

27
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:28,319
for infused

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,320
products Harold designed the industrial

29
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:34,039
leading cannabis emulsions that are

30
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:37,519
widely applied in the Cannabis beverage

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,000
Brands he also holds 16 patents in

32
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,920
Emulsion applications and prior to

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,239
founding ferosa he had led a team that

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,040
developed the emulsification oil for Bor

35
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,078

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,880
system Harold also publishes a regular

37
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,478
series explaining the science of

38
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,599
cannabis for product makers under the

39
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:02,000
name the happy chemist a nickname you'll

40
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,478
understand after you watch this

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,118
interview one of his recent articles

42
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,399
describes the different factors that

43
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,000
contribute to cannabis beverage potency

44
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,080
loss which is a challenge for beverage

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,199
brands in fact in regulated markets it's

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,480
common to see a 10 to 15% variation in

47
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,919
potency compared to label claims in

48
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,199
unregulated hemp derive beverages it can

49
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,559
be even

50
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,598
higher during our conversation we

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,640
discuss the difference between cannabis

52
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:35,359
bever bages and alcoholic beverages what

53
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:39,238
happens when canabo

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,159
oxidize how to put THC into water-based

55
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,959
products using physical and chemical

56
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:46,639
processes how every aspect of the supply

57
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,840
chain can lead to potency loss in

58
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,759
cannabis

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,560
beverages which beverage ingredients

60
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,519
accelerate potency loss how packaging

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,959
conditions can affect scalping and

62
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,000
oxidation rates and more before before

63
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,000
we get to my conversation with Harold

78
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,479
h good morning Harold thanks so much for

79
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,878
join joining us on the podcast good

80
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,000
morning Ben thank you for having me well

81
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:08,438
I'm excited to talk with you today about

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,400
cannabis beverages it's one of the

83
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:12,919
fastest growing segments in the canvas

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,079
Market but it's not without its

85
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,639
challenges um and Regulators consumers

86
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,000
will often compare cannabis beverages to

87
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,199
alcohol so I guess my first question to

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,240
you is is that a fair comparison and how

89
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,240
are they

90
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,199
different that's a very good question

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,120
because um alcohol is what consumer and

92
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,960
regular know for hundreds of years which

93
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,879
is a beverage that is adult use that can

94
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,918
change your mindset that can be

95
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,600
impairing uh impairing you right and

96
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,120
from those aspects Canabis beverage are

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,840
similar to alcohol but canis beverage

98
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,120
maybe we can just single say uh TC

99
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:54,279
beverages right because CBD beverages

100
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,600
have different U impairment issues so if

101
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:59,719
you compare TC beverages with alcohol

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,600
you know the main comparison the main

103
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,520
difference are the active compounds so

104
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:10,039
for one is ethanol right alcohol one is

105
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:12,439
THC and ethanol is water soluble right

106
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:14,240
TC is oil soluble so that is the

107
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,839
fundamental difference between the two

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,360
actives so what actually leads from that

109
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,879
is when ethanol is water soluble it's

110
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,000
actually easier to be incorporated into

111
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,959
all kinds of different beverages right

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,519
it's easy to dilute and it doesn't the

113
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,879
fundamental features of alcohol is it

114
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:38,079
doesn't sculp meaning it doesn't attach

115
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:41,478
to the K liners or any packaging right

116
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,599
and it doesn't um it doesn't oxidize so

117
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,279
you can say you can save a liquor for

118
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,000
200 years you reopen that and still have

119
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:53,758
the same content of the liquor right but

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,399
on the other hand THC is very easy to be

121
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,600
oxidized right and the oxidation rate is

122
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,758
is like a constant so you have to work

123
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,439
around it but also THC because of the

124
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,160
hydrophobicity you have to have

125
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:10,800
different technology to get the THC into

126
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,759
the Beverages and through by doing that

127
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,199
due to this hydrophobicity the THC will

128
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,598
tend to stck to different packagings or

129
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,879
can be um sensitive to heat sensitive to

130
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:26,159
other ingredients right so that's where

131
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,800
the cous beverage as a whole uh subject

132
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,439
to you know more potency loss issues

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,478
compared to aloh

134
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:36,560
just right so you so you mentioned

135
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:39,279
oxidation so what happens when these

136
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,160
cannaboids oxidize like

137
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,839
what yeah well fundamentally from the

138
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,680
surface you lose potency right that's

139
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,399
from the COA you see that okay potency

140
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,918
dropped but deeper down into what what

141
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:57,159
really happened to the conoids you know

142
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,279
I think more research are needed here um

143
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,720
for example we know TC the oxid

144
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:06,318
oxidizing end results is CBN but usually

145
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,440
we don't see a onetoone conversion right

146
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,280
uh so so you you lose one molecule of

147
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:14,160
THC usually you don't see a formation of

148
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,239
one molecule of CBN so that indicates

149
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
some other molecules are formed along

150
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,879
this path right so what are those

151
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,560
molecules I think you know this is where

152
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,439
I strongly advocate for more fing and

153
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,120
research uh especially as a cannabis

154
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:33,800
beverage as a whole category

155
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,319
research on that category now is this

156
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,680
oxidation a challenge for other forms of

157
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,439
cannabis products Beyond

158
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,478
beverages I I believe so you know we

159
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,560
have heard you know the the joints the

160
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,839
flowers they are oxidized right the

161
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,680
turpins get lost over over time over the

162
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:54,318
shelf life uh but I think beverage is

163
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,959
unique form factor because um for

164
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,479
example our technology we um drive down

165
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:04,318
the droplet size right to the nanometer

166
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:09,240
size from 200 nanometers to a th000

167
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:12,759
nanometers so that formation give a um

168
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,918
much larger surface area right so um

169
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,120
which is great for the onset purpose so

170
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:20,399
consumer can feel the effect much

171
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,879
quicker but on the other hand um those

172
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,158
enlarged surface area will have more

173
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,680
oxygen attacking to the conoids so the

174
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:32,120
oxidation rate between a joint to a

175
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,240
beverages could be different so that's

176
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,879
that's why I I advocate you know the

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,240
research should be focusing on its own

178
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,158
category right I I I I would really hope

179
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,519
you know more University and researchers

180
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,000
open are open to study canis beverages

181
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,360
great no and you touched on a great

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,679
point there and I'm hoping that you can

183
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,519
explain so so we we talked about how

184
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:56,599
canabo they are hydrophobic and so to

185
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,039
try to put them into a beverage is

186
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,120
challenging right so what is that

187
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:03,599
technology and I know you mentioned em

188
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,919
Emulsion and everything so maybe you

189
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,399
know let's let's get basic with it like

190
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:12,639
how are these products

191
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:16,320
made yes so

192
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:18,639
um let's talk about how to put TC into

193
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,320
water-based product right because TC is

194
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,600
oil soluble so there are in my opinion

195
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,360
there are two main School of thoughts

196
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
one is chemical modification one is

197
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,399
physical modification so chemical

198
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,839
modification is you change the structure

199
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,120
of T's a chemical structure you you add

200
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,920
some functional groups to make it water

201
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,959
soluble to make t as a sugar or salt um

202
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,559
it has its own challenges of this path

203
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:46,559
because you are creating a pro drug a

204
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:49,399
new molecule right and the you need to

205
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,439
study the uh safety and efficacy of the

206
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:55,000
new molecule another route is the

207
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,600
physical route which is the main

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,039
application for most of the beverage now

209
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,920
the physical route is even though is THC

210
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:06,199
is not water soluble but you change the

211
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:09,919
form factor of the THC uh for for us for

212
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,278
example we use Nano emotion as a um

213
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,078
subcategory of the emotion category the

214
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,759
emotion can be divided into Nano emotion

215
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:20,479
and micro emotion the two parts right so

216
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,120
we are the non emotion um they are not

217
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
defined by the size actually they are

218
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,440
defined by the energy level so by how

219
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,920
you produce uh the emotion but either

220
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,800
way the end result is

221
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,278
the emotion process make the TC dist

222
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,399
into billions of smaller droplets and

223
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,559
they code each droplet with a layer of

224
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,759
suant

225
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,919
emulsifiers uh depending on the osif

226
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,879
fire origin it can be synthetic it can

227
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,240
be natural derived it can be organic

228
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,519
derived uh at vertosa we only use

229
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:54,320
organic derived osier which are safe and

230
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,639
widely available uh to to Consumers so

231
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,519
um yeah that's the basic gist so you

232
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,480
break the distillate or the the

233
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,560
molecules into smaller fragments and

234
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,320
then coat it with a more water soluble

235
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:11,119
um compound or um yes that makes sense

236
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,079
and then then mix it in and it kind of

237
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,679
stays in suspension and is homogeneous

238
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:21,039
right so we essentially we change how TC

239
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,399
exists from a big molec from a big

240
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,319
aggregation of thislet into smaller

241
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,399
Aggregates of droplets and which is are

242
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,720
coated by a layer of surfectants and

243
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,639
surfectants make that dropless would

244
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,000
compatible so this dropless can flow

245
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,560
inside the liquid uh beverages

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,078
freely excellent all right so that's

247
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,518
probably a good segue into talking about

248
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,559
so you recently wrote an article on

249
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,720
LinkedIn um explaining some of the

250
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,359
challenges for this potency loss and you

251
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,920
kind of kicked it off saying that you

252
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,959
did a a poll of your followers to asking

253
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,719
what they think is the most important

254
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:00,958
factor in you know preventing potency

255
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,879
loss and it seemed like most people

256
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,078
thought it was sort of this Emulsion

257
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,320
technology or the infusion technology

258
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:10,399
which is what you were describing um so

259
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,839
first of all do you agree with that

260
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,480
assessment and um why do you think

261
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:21,040
people think that that is the most

262
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:23,560
important um um I have seen issues uh of

263
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,399
the downstream P issues happening and

264
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,679
the root cause could be the emotion

265
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,600
right I have seen that but I also have

266
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,679
seen um many other areas along the

267
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,120
supply chain of making the cans

268
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:39,078
beverages when any of the sector has

269
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,278
issues or problems the accumulated

270
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,759
effect is contributing to the end

271
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:47,320
results which is opponency loss so um

272
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,958
yes the infusion tag is very important

273
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,160
because because it's complex right

274
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:55,159
because the infusion tag itself needs to

275
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,919
be stable right uh and then when you put

276
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:00,360
that infusion Tech the emotion or

277
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:02,838
whatever technology into the B es it

278
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,639
needs to be stable in a beverage so it

279
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,079
the self stability and the beverage

280
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:11,399
stability are two aspects right so

281
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:14,078
sometimes it's um it's hard to assume

282
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,320
you have a stable Emotion by itself and

283
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,719
you're going to have a stable product no

284
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,480
we have seen this U failure time and

285
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,440
time again um and you have to really

286
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,519
assess like the two lanes right U make

287
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,279
sure you have a stable emotion but also

288
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,399
this is the most interesting part part

289
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,559
and complex part because emotion could

290
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,600
be you know two to three formulas or

291
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,799
four formulas this could be a thousand

292
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,000
skewes right they are having different

293
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,639
PHS they have different ingredients heat

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,559
stability packaging so it's it's really

295
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,039
the wild part of expanding the emotion

296
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,958
into the finished product so that's

297
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:52,599
where vertosa actually spend a lot of

298
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:55,758
time understanding our clients uh from

299
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,680
the industry okay what kind of um

300
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,278
beverage for formulation they are what

301
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,198
kind of packaging Co manufacturers a

302
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:03,679
testing lab so I know you're going to

303
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:06,278
dive into it but you know that's

304
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:09,399
essentially the whole supply chain that

305
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,198
could potentially impact the pocy yeah

306
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,320
no and you're right we're GNA get into

307
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,838
kind of the different parts of the

308
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,320
supply chain but before I we get on to

309
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,079
that um I wanted to ask so when we're

310
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,560
talking about losing potency how much

311
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,758
are we talking about here like um are

312
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,039
there is there sort of a standard rate

313
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,159
of potency

314
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,719
loss um

315
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:34,639
if you ask me the standards you

316
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,920
know for beverages there are regulated

317
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,839
beverages by States and there are hand

318
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:44,679
beverages so if you if you ask by um uh

319
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:47,920
state by state there is a 10 to 15%

320
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,838
variation from the label claim right but

321
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:54,120
if you ask me about hand beverages so

322
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,480
far there is U no strict regulation yet

323
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,320
right so which the industry I know

324
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,639
they're advocating for um better

325
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:07,120
regulation better standards um so

326
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:10,360
um yeah the be hand beverages could have

327
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,198
you know a huge loss over the shelf life

328
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,560
right the shelf life they Brands claimed

329
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,278
and some some Brands may have um you

330
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,599
know not as much lost over the shelf

331
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:23,879
life some Brands may have a huge loss so

332
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,959
we see this um huge difference and we

333
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,879
see there's um big need for the industry

334
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,159
to better ourself because consumer love

335
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:35,759
this product and consumer need this

336
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:38,159
product and if we don't do a good job to

337
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,519
you if we lose the trust of consumers

338
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,399
and they say okay all those hand

339
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,639
beverages are finicky and they don't

340
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,039
give me enough minrs on the claim I

341
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,360
think that's detrimental to the whole

342
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:53,480
thing so that's where verosa as a it try

343
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,959
we try to lead the conversation and

344
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,879
educate our partners and clients hey you

345
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,318
need to pay attention to all the details

346
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,879
that leads to pocy loss you can't just

347
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:06,958
assume you had a good emotion you have a

348
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,039
good co manufacturer then everything's

349
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,919
fine right so that's where we want try

350
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,360
we want to try to uh educate people yeah

351
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,958
and I have to imagine with so many

352
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,120
different brands out there and so many

353
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,439
different products um using so many

354
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,959
different technologies that without sort

355
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,839
of that standardization like you're

356
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,439
right I mean some consumers might um

357
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,319
experience a potency loss with one brand

358
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,880
and sort of apply that to everyone else

359
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:34,559
where that's not really the case right

360
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,679
right I I feel the history will we're

361
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:41,958
early right it's it's 2024 we're early

362
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,239
in this um canvas beverage sector and

363
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:47,439
more research are needed more regulation

364
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,399
are needed right so I I'm strongly um

365
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,800
advocate for for those to

366
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,720
happen all right all right so let's

367
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,039
let's dive into the the supply chain

368
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,399
here so maybe we'll we'll start with um

369
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,318
can you tell us what are sort of the the

370
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,399
seven parts of the canvas beverage

371
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:07,078
supply chain yeah sounds like a book

372
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:10,558
title uh so uh it starts with from the

373
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:13,318
Cannabis input right THC CBD CBN so

374
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,759
input and then goes next step is the

375
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:18,558
infusion tag right either emotion or

376
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,318
powder or some other infusion technology

377
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,879
and then the infusion technology will go

378
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,480
into a formulation that's where the

379
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,400
beverage base is formulated the flavors

380
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,200
the all the other U ingredients you put

381
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,160
emotion to the beverage base and then

382
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,160
you have to select the packaging right

383
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,600
can glass PS and then you figure all

384
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,840
that out you give all this formula to

385
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,959
the co manufacturer who produce the

386
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:46,879
beverages for you right and after you

387
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,200
produce it you send to the lab right and

388
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,880
the lab will test for the potency and

389
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,519
then the final finished product will go

390
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,559
into distribution or retail so those are

391
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,759
the main seven steps for the supply

392
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,240
chain excellent all right so let's start

393
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,359
at the beginning with cannabinoid input

394
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:08,400
how can that stage sort of affect

395
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:08,399
potency loss down at the end yeah so

396
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:17,720
um the main thing is the

397
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:20,240
um how easy is the canids be oxidized um

398
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,159
we know um from our early data we have

399
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,038
seen THC and

400
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:28,080
thcv as the

401
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:29,359
most the easiest to be oxidized and and

402
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,918
the the quick

403
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:36,439
right um well CBD and CBG are following

404
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,880
right they are slower but they still

405
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:43,798
oxidized and CBC and CBN are behind that

406
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,919
right the as the third category they are

407
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:49,558
um much slower but they do even though

408
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,200
CBN you know is kind of stable in on

409
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:54,079
Theory but uh from our early um

410
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,440
preliminary study you know we have seen

411
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:00,798
CBN get lost in beverage too so

412
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,640
again we still need answers of what it

413
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:07,440
becomes to right um over time what does

414
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,080
the ox oxidation do to the conoids this

415
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,200
is where I hope more research are needed

416
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:16,480
right so so THC is one of the fastest to

417
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:21,240
oxidize that's that's um inconvenient

418
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,440
huh inconvenient yes yes okay so

419
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,599
infusion Tech is the next phase and I

420
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,120
think we sort of already touched on that

421
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,879
unless you think that there's more to

422
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,119
talk about about how that can sort of

423
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,960
affect the potency loss here um yeah um

424
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean infusion Tech like I said

425
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:42,600
it's it's it's a very um um dual concept

426
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,440
people regard infusion Tech as simple

427
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,480
right because producing emotions are

428
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,360
relatively straightforward but actually

429
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,440
it's complex um you know it's it's

430
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,558
especially when you put that ingredients

431
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,400
into the products right that complexity

432
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,200
generates through this

433
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,038
process great

434
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,880
okay so now beverage

435
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,839
formulation um can you talk about some

436
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,120
some of the different components that

437
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,678
are going into Beverages and how how

438
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,599
they present different

439
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,038
challenges yeah well beverage usually

440
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,759
has over 90% water that's that's the

441
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:21,960
main thing right but then the rest 5 to

442
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:25,038
10% you have um flavors right you have

443
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:30,000
functions uh functional groups like uh

444
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:33,839
uh TC or U vitamins or electrolytes

445
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,119
right um B you know polyphenols stuff

446
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,519
like that and then you have a uh

447
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,639
supporting ingredients like

448
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:44,079
preservatives uh pH modulators so

449
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,440
essentially those are in my opinion the

450
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,038
three main

451
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,840
things right and so how can they sort of

452
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:55,440
affect how your how your emotion works

453
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:57,399
or how um how potency L um so far I

454
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,519
think verto has been infusing over a

455
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,038
thousand skews on the market market and

456
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:06,918
we have been collecting data of of the

457
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:10,720
Thousand SKS what's their density um pH

458
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:15,400
bricks um color you know taste was the

459
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:18,600
profile um and um um we have seen that

460
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,240
certain brands certain clients they have

461
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,839
the same packaging same emotion uh same

462
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,679
po manufacturer but they have different

463
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:29,038
flavors and strange enough just that

464
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,278
flavor difference

465
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,839
will cause a potency difference right

466
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:38,640
especially in the beginning of the

467
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:40,720
dosing or long-term shelf life and again

468
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,559
this is where

469
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,839
um this is where I think the industry

470
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:49,839
need mainstream knowledge and mainstream

471
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,119
power because we as verosa we are small

472
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,798
right and and the whole industry is

473
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:57,038
small we we all try to figure this out

474
00:21:53,798 --> 00:22:00,000
but the complex of the base really need

475
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,200
beverage experts to help us understand

476
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,440
why certain ingredients you know on

477
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,240
downt the mechanism is impacting the

478
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:12,278
pocy loss right we so I think we have to

479
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,000
admit we see some um causation a cause B

480
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:18,319
but we don't know why this happened

481
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,240
right so so but my goal is to create a a

482
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,439
naughty list of ingredients uh naughty

483
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,640
list like if you uh currently using our

484
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,600
current infusion Tech of THC um maybe

485
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,840
try to avoid those five or six

486
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,719
ingredients in your beverages until we

487
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,720
figure out a technology can be

488
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:40,480
compatible with those ingredients so

489
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,200
that's that's where we are um as verosa

490
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,919
um but I think one of the thing I'm

491
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,240
proud of is um dollar it's a big German

492
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:53,880
company in the beverage ingredient space

493
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,839
and verosa dollar have some uh research

494
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,720
collaboration uh on in this topic and uh

495
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,480
you know we are really excited about

496
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,480
bringing bringing you know mainstream

497
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,519
players who have years of you know

498
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,960
Decades of experience on formulation to

499
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:13,158
help us interesting so a naughty list of

500
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,759
ingredients interesting naughty list yes

501
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:16,440
uh do you have any I know you said

502
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,679
you're working on it but do are there

503
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,480
any that that you know of yet or still

504
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,440
doing the research there

505
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,599
um couple things I can mention um

506
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,679
electrolytes could be potentially

507
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:36,038
a problem um polyphenol sometimes could

508
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,840
be a problem um some flavors um but

509
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:40,599
those flavors we still we're still

510
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,199
studying right but those are the two you

511
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:47,599
know top of proteins for example could

512
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,640
cause problem um yeah so I guess as a

513
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,759
consumer if I if we're looking at

514
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,320
Beverages and potentially to make a

515
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,319
purchase are there certain ones that you

516
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,639
know should be avoided or maybe are more

517
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:02,599
prone to maybe a potency loss and or

518
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,600
ones that are kind of more more

519
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:09,798
stable I

520
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,799
think I don't know the answer because

521
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,600
um I I would love to know more of the

522
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,720
consumer feedbacks right uh I I think

523
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,759
we're getting there but I I don't think

524
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,919
the whole industry has a lot of consumer

525
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,158
feedback you know how does Consumer like

526
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,759
the flavor how does they like how do

527
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,799
they like each Brands what is their um

528
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,319
determining factor is the flavor is the

529
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:35,639
effect yeah you know is the onset or or

530
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:37,558
something else or the packaging so um

531
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,200
yeah I I would love to see more data

532
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:44,119
from consumers and then then I can tell

533
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,440
you how we can educate them but now I I

534
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:49,319
feel like what is encouraging is

535
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,480
consumer now given the trial from the h

536
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:55,639
beverages going to the mainstream they

537
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,839
seem to like it they seem to be uh

538
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,399
designing uh Desiring for it because

539
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,759
they want to find something to replace

540
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:04,000
alcohol so this is fitting right into

541
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,359
that category so that's that's a very

542
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,240
encouraging no absolutely and I could

543
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,119
say personally I've I've seen more

544
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,720
people sort of moving towards cannabis

545
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:18,678
beverages um to replace alcohol and uh I

546
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,839
have to say flavor is is certainly one

547
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,240
of the biggest considerations because

548
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,720
there's some out there that don't taste

549
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,599
that great right right and flavor is the

550
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,880
U first layer of sensory right um

551
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:32,918
because you buy the canvas beverage for

552
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,320
effect effect and F is the first layer

553
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:39,520
of effect does this generate a a um a

554
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,398
joyful experience for you yeah EXA I

555
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,599
mean and if we're looking at alcohol too

556
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:44,519
I mean that's where where a lot of

557
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,319
people base their decisions on alcohol

558
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:50,398
as well you know do you like red or

559
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,918
white wine or you know it's the same

560
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:54,918
ethanol right exactly yeah you're not

561
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,640
just drinking straight ethanol that's

562
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,600
for sure okay so we talked about

563
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,360
beverage form formulation um oh actually

564
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,439
no one thing I before we move on from

565
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:07,519
that um I noticed in the in the write up

566
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,919
that you were talking about scalping

567
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:14,558
rates what is that and well what is that

568
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:17,480
right scalping is a term used in the

569
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:20,759
beverage industry for a long time it is

570
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,679
it describes the process of active

571
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:26,359
ingredients in the beverages attaching

572
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,679
to the packaging because the packaging

573
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:32,798
material could be hydrophobic right it

574
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,640
lacks oil so when you have a oil like uh

575
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,480
ingredients it may stck to the liner

576
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,640
right and then lose its potency in a

577
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,038
liquid so that that process called

578
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,000
scaling okay well that's a good segue

579
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:46,200
because we're going to talk about

580
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,759
packaging next so yeah so maybe talk

581
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,360
about some of the different liner types

582
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,919
that are available and how they can sort

583
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,918
of affect that those scalping rates

584
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,440
great um funny enough I just published a

585
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:00,278
article last Friday talking about

586
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:03,919
calendar types and uh yeah the con liner

587
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:08,640
is kind of a a big issue for the whole

588
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:11,038
industry um and we have six years ago in

589
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,038
California nobody's using C everybody's

590
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,798
using glass because all the infusion

591
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,679
technology are not stable in a can and I

592
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:21,759
think this is the first issue verosa

593
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:25,080
have helped come the industry solved um

594
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,919
we we were working with ball PPG all the

595
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:30,398
Big King companies and lender companies

596
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,799
with has all their generations of liners

597
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,479
and we summarized okay and we improve

598
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:39,079
our formula we summarized okay what

599
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:42,240
formula Works in what liner and so today

600
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:44,759
I think we can confidently make a 12

601
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,679
months stable beverages with a good

602
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:50,158
emotion in a good liner a good

603
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:53,200
combination but at the same time when

604
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,880
the H beverages brands are uh going to

605
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,600
the market in the very uh fast speed

606
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,200
right they they get what they can get

607
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:04,439
right which is understandable as a

608
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:07,519
market um but sometimes that leads to a

609
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,080
NE lack of the quality of the liners so

610
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,519
we have seen issues that clients U

611
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:16,158
picked the wrong liners and the wrong

612
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:19,599
liners will lead to much higher pocy

613
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,399
scoping right um and those are the

614
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:25,719
continuous issues verosa is is wanting

615
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,798
to educate our clients great so now did

616
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,798
I hear correctly that this isn't so much

617
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:33,200
an issue issue with

618
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:37,119
glass yes you're right and so what are

619
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,558
some of the advantages of using cans

620
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,798
versus glass I mean if you don't have

621
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,440
the issue with glass why don't we see

622
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:45,879
more Brands using glass right I think

623
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:50,000
it's the um the heaviness of the

624
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,679
logistic shipping and the recyclability

625
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,558
right and uh I think those sort of too

626
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,120
un

627
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,240
cost great okay so in addition to

628
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,518
scalping one of the other things that

629
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,798
you mentioned was um oxy oxygen Ingress

630
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,440
and kind of leading to that oxidation so

631
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:11,158
how how is that a factor interesting

632
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,278
yeah so like I said oxygen is kind of

633
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,640
the big enemy for cannabis

634
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:20,079
beverages actually

635
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:22,519
um I I advocate for our industry to use

636
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,798
beer as a benchmark because when you

637
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:27,159
make a beer if you have high oxygen the

638
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,558
flavor will change dramatically right in

639
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,159
a very short time

640
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,960
um so beer industry has perfected their

641
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,760
practice on lower the do dissolve oxygen

642
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,399
during the production right so uh that's

643
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:42,200
why what we Advocate our co-packer of

644
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,719
the canas beverage is to follow the

645
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,200
practice of beer so imagine you have a

646
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,159
um packaging that has low oxygen to

647
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,319
start with right but if the packaging

648
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:57,000
somehow allows oxygen to come in from

649
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:59,398
its seal or from the the body or from

650
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,919
anywhere then then it doesn't matter you

651
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:04,239
have a low do to start dissolve oxygen

652
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,960
will continue to climb up and then the

653
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,278
ainise will be continuously to be uh

654
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,919
oxidized right so that's where we we we

655
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:16,159
see this potential issue especially from

656
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:19,320
pet bottles because pet the whole bottle

657
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,880
will allow oxygen come in constantly but

658
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:25,798
not only pet some glass bottles with u

659
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,640
you know Chell resistant cap right or

660
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,440
even some Can U with a

661
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,880
a special lits right May potentially

662
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,519
Ingress oxygen so we are having some

663
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,880
resarch collaboration with a lab right

664
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:44,519
now uh to to further look into this this

665
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,200
is um this seems to be a easy concept to

666
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,519
understand but actually it's very

667
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,720
complex to test because you have to

668
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:54,399
remove the oxygen you have to control

669
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,079
the environment so it's this is a nearly

670
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,678
a year process right now with the with

671
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:02,319
our testing part

672
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,200
so stay tuned for this data wow okay so

673
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,439
yeah no and that's an interesting point

674
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,679
because I mean at least with the

675
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,720
Cannabis beverages I've used yeah it's

676
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,759
not your standard kind of um lid that

677
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,240
you would see on a can of Coke or a beer

678
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,038
or something like that it's sort of that

679
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:22,200
childproof tamperproof um tab so that

680
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:24,319
can actually um lead to more oxygen

681
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,000
Ingress you're saying potentially

682
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,839
potentially yeah

683
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,720
yeah okay interesting okay um so we

684
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,678
talked about pack so just kind of I

685
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,079
guess to sum up packaging sounds like

686
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,360
there's there's two main things that

687
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:38,759
you're trying to prevent here and that's

688
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:42,240
the scalping of you know sort of the

689
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:43,960
molecules attaching to the liner of the

690
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,720
actual packaging so you're it's not

691
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,399
actually getting to the consumer when

692
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,000
they consume it and it's this oxidation

693
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,359
right those are the two sort of main

694
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,240
problems you're trying to solve for yes

695
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,119
and to summarize it one is physical one

696
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,278
is

697
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,199
chemical interesting perfect all right

698
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:04,000
so now let's talk about beverage

699
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,399
manufacturer um how I I can imagine a

700
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,720
number of different ways that that can

701
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:13,599
introduce some problems right um so uh

702
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,440
interestingly there's a joke that verosa

703
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,879
we don't make beverages right but we

704
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,759
work with a lot of Co manufacturers so

705
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,720
we're not golfers but we're good caddies

706
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:26,519
we have seen golfers make mistakes here

707
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:30,200
and there so to level up the whole

708
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:32,720
industry veros actually we drafted a um

709
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,319
cannabis beverage manufacturing handbook

710
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,720
so this in this handbook is you know 100

711
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,119
pages long handbook we include every

712
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,679
elements of from weighing the

713
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:45,000
ingredients introducing the ingredients

714
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:49,639
um control the dissolve oxygen how to

715
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:54,480
test tank how to package um yeah it's a

716
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:57,398
lot right because the main issue I see

717
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,798
is producing beverage is easy right a

718
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:03,719
lot of uh companies can can make that

719
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:06,000
but canas beverage is different it's a

720
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,960
hybrid between regular Beverages and the

721
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,240
pharmaceutical layer because you have to

722
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,600
guarantee each can get 10 five

723
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,720
milligrams right so um and previously

724
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:20,719
the um beverage command their main

725
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,679
belief is okay I drop this bag of

726
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,880
ingredients into the tank it should be

727
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,000
there it's homogeneous right it should

728
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,320
be there uh for example if I make a

729
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,880
probiotic drink

730
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,119
like I claim 10 grams of fiber per can

731
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,480
right on the label nobody's measured

732
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,439
that 10 and Ure you each can get 10

733
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:42,480
grams of fiber eight grams of 12 grams

734
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,480
consumer okay with it um but canvas is

735
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,639
different so I think the fundamentally

736
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,759
uh this concept needs to change in the

737
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:54,079
operator's head they are making a

738
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:58,240
pharmaceutical like beverages right so

739
00:33:54,079 --> 00:34:03,079
that you know that leads to the TC

740
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,798
is um is easy to be um Changed by

741
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:07,960
oxidation by sculping um and the

742
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:10,079
weighing right and the residue of the

743
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,800
emotion so all the details could

744
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,639
potentially lead to a filled product so

745
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,800
that's where the handbook really

746
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,200
emphasize on what you should pay

747
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,720
attention to and U changing the concept

748
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:27,439
it's not regular beverages is is a

749
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:28,959
medicine yeah no and and you're right it

750
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,358
it introduces a number of different

751
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,838
variables because you could you could

752
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:35,000
develop a great product um but then you

753
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,159
have to turn it over to the manufacturer

754
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,519
to actually you know produce it at scale

755
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,760
so if they're not paying attention to

756
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:43,719
those details it's not going to be the

757
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,919
same quality that you started with right

758
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:50,000
right yes I I I do believe this whole

759
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:52,519
industry need standardization and one of

760
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,639
one of the main part is the standardized

761
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:57,719
operation in producing the beverages

762
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,880
right no and then so you touched on

763
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,078
something um homogeneity which I know

764
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,599
kind of dovetails into our next topic of

765
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:08,000
of the testing of the actual product

766
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,920
right and so

767
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,079
um talk about that how how can that lead

768
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,358
to an issue with potency loss um the

769
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,079
actual testing the labeling and then

770
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:22,519
comparing it to what's actually um in in

771
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,240
the can at the end of the day right um I

772
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:28,159
think the testing

773
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:30,559
lab may have three categories of of of

774
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,440
issues right the first category is

775
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,000
inherent because nationalwide we don't

776
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,920
have a

777
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,079
standardized um standard material right

778
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,559
so you buy different standard materials

779
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,240
they can be just off by Purity right

780
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:49,599
from batch to batch even so so that's

781
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:53,039
inherent another issue is um Integrity

782
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,440
of the lab right so um some Labs give

783
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,679
you a inflate potency some lab will um

784
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,440
Pander to your potency claim on the

785
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,639
label and they know you want five

786
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,599
milligram okay I I give you 4.8 plus

787
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:08,400
that right so I I have I have heard that

788
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,519
happening in multiple Labs so that's

789
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,920
Integrity issue and another issue is the

790
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:18,559
technology issue is the um you know when

791
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,440
you infuse over thousand skews you start

792
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:24,920
to find certain flavors or ingredients

793
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,720
in the beverage may need a special

794
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,079
extraction method because um we're still

795
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,639
we we have seen the early sign of this

796
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:37,920
we're still uh uh you

797
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:40,358
know completing our um observation here

798
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,920
but we have observed certain ingredients

799
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:47,078
like cream or fat in the beverages will

800
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,599
hold on to the TC not letting go right

801
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,920
so you need a you need to design a new

802
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,599
method a stronger method to extract the

803
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,599
TC from the beverages so you see that

804
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,680
that actually is

805
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:03,599
bottom line

806
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:06,039
is maybe the ass skilles do not need one

807
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,480
single method maybe you have to develop

808
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:10,759
three or four methods to really see okay

809
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,240
what ingredients will follow what

810
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,240
intraction method right now do you do

811
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:18,318
any of that testing in House at at

812
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:20,598
bertosa or do you use third party Labs

813
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:23,358
we use third party Labs

814
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:26,160
um the main reason is we understand how

815
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:29,318
finicky the data could be and even from

816
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:33,039
Lab to lab they have variations right so

817
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:36,358
we um so that's why we trust UNESCO uh

818
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:39,920
in San Francisco they are a DA FDA

819
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:43,799
certified lab with 80 years of history

820
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,760
of running food samples and um so that

821
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,280
is at least our anchor of of accuracy

822
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,760
and consistency we often use anasco to

823
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,359
compare to other labs um but there are

824
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,560
great Labs out there like infinite

825
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:59,119
chemical like cambian labs in Michigan

826
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:02,400
again so there are good Labs over there

827
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,480
act Labs um but you know smeers I'm just

828
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,400
mhing a few that we we we work with they

829
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,639
they are great um but there are many

830
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,480
many Labs that just you know they're

831
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:15,239
smaller they're trying to figure out the

832
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,159
supply chain and I don't blame them it's

833
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:20,879
it's a hard business yeah running a lab

834
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:24,078
is hard it's it's a lot of details a lot

835
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,680
of invest on on the dollars yeah a lot

836
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,119
of training is hard yeah no um we feel

837
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,078
it too we work with a lot of testing

838
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,559
labs and you know definitely feel the

839
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:35,800
challenges that they face and yeah and

840
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:38,078
you bring up one of one that's

841
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,880
constantly coming up is that you know

842
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,760
cannabis is being infused into all

843
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:46,039
different things these days from

844
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:49,280
beverages to Edibles to candies to

845
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:52,039
topicals and to sort of develop methods

846
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,280
to reliably um deal with all of those

847
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:57,559
different uh matrices is

848
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,079
hard exactly yeah you you didn't mention

849
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:01,519
condiments I think you're going to be a

850
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,960
great a good sector a fun sector

851
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:07,239
condiments yeah infused ketchup yes hot

852
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,000
sauce hot oh yeah hot sauce would be

853
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:12,318
nice all right great so we're at the end

854
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,239
of the supply chain here distribution um

855
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:16,719
so I imagine you know storage conditions

856
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:20,000
things like that could really um cause

857
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,959
issues with potency right um especially

858
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,920
tied to the uh relation of oxidation and

859
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,119
oxidation will happen at higher

860
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,639
temperature so and we know know that

861
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,680
with the uh climate change you know the

862
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:35,199
in the truck when the truck going into

863
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:37,719
Florida or Texas it's going to be hot in

864
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,919
in a truck if it's is not specially made

865
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:42,399
for cold chain supply so how how do the

866
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,240
impact

867
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,318
for a beer or or liquor it may be

868
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,639
different compared to a TC because of

869
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:52,759
the oxidation issue wow so temperature

870
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,239
is really an issue what what temperature

871
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,960
is sort of the ideal range for these

872
00:39:55,239 --> 00:40:02,358
beverages um

873
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,639
I say don't go o do not go over 35 to 40

874
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:06,639
degrees

875
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:09,799
C right so that's that's kind of my

876
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:13,759
suggestion because the reason is Canada

877
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,200
and Michigan The Regulators use 40° C as

878
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,240
they're accelerating testing condition

879
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:21,118
so you don't want to store your

880
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:24,279
beverages in accelerated conditions for

881
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,200
research studies right so try to avoid

882
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,359
um try to yeah get lower to 40 degrees

883
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:32,000
right right all right all right so we

884
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:35,679
did it we got through got through the

885
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
supply chain um that was great um all

886
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,239
right so winding down here um Harold

887
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,480
tell us a little bit more about vertosa

888
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:47,118
um what you guys are working on and um

889
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,838
how people can learn more great um so

890
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,318
verosa has been in a business for six

891

years uh we just had our sixth

892
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:57,838
anniversary party last week uh in our

893
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:02,039
head headquarter in Berkeley California

894
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:05,599
thank you and uh we are fortunate uh

895
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:08,599
to have this business um you know

896
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,039
oftentimes we ask we ask ourself is this

897
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:14,079
real right you know selling a water

898
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:18,119
compatible Canino as a business you know

899
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:21,079
is is unfadable six years ago and seeing

900
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,680
but but also seeing the um the fruit

901
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,200
that we build with our clients and

902
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:29,000
partners through the supply chain and

903
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:31,480
seeing the impact of just Pence beverage

904
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,880
to everybody every every consumer in

905
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,559
America and uh it is it's a it's a

906
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,039
strong belief for us to experience this

907
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:45,318
this journey um but there's a lot to do

908
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:47,440
and our focus is continue perfecting our

909
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:50,400
infusion tech there are still a lot to

910
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,679
learn right we are leading the industry

911
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,920
but I have to admit we still have a lot

912
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:59,078
to answer and U in order to find the

913
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,200
answers I don't think we can go along I

914
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:02,920
think we should collaborate we should

915
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,879
find more collaboration we should

916
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,400
support more researchers even

917
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,079
competitors you know among this this

918
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,440
industry we need to learn from each

919
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:14,440
other we need to encourage each other

920
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,400
and Propel the industry I don't think

921
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,519
any company can work in in Silo uh to

922
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,720
have okay I I I own this or something so

923
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,239
that's my advocate for okay more

924
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:27,279
researchers more collaboration

925
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:29,199
throughout the industry no and that's

926
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,079
perfect I mean that aligns perfectly

927
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:33,279
with what we're trying to do with canmed

928
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:37,079
is to try to bring together all the top

929
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,960
Minds on cultivation medicine um and

930
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:41,400
science of course um to bring them

931
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,599
together to learn from each other so

932
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,240
that we can push this thing forward

933
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,519
because uh we agree um it's going to

934
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,199
take all of us working together to to

935
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:52,358
see this thing forward um competitors

936
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:56,039
doesn't matter um we can all learn from

937
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:58,279
each other um so maybe one last question

938
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:01,079
I want to ask you from a consumer

939
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,319
standpoint um if you're looking for

940
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,720
cannabis beverages are there certain

941
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:08,119
things that you should be looking for to

942
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:11,879
sort of evaluate maybe higher quality

943
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:14,079
versus uh lower quality or you know

944
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,559
maybe not so much quality but you know

945
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,880
about the things that we talked about

946
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,040
here are there sort of indicators that

947
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,240
we could look for to be like okay this

948
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:25,639
is a this is a good

949
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,358
choice okay so if you talk about uh if

950
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:30,639
you evaluating a uh alcohol Brands beer

951
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:34,039
or letx say beer right compared to low

952
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:36,440
those TC beverages um beer usually is

953
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,039
flavor and packaging right how how do

954
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,720
how does it taste um for cannabis

955
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,279
beverage we discussed sensory of flavor

956
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,519
is the still the first you know category

957
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,880
of of of

958
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:51,599
judgment but I think I want to uh

959
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,358
Advocate to the Consumers canid Beverage

960
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,680
has this effect effect right the E

961
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:57,639
effect actually is what you're paying

962
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,519
for it's not you're not paying for a

963
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:02,199
good tasting beverages you can buy that

964
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,838
from Costco very cheaply right right but

965
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:06,919
you are paying for a effect that alcohol

966
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:10,318
doesn't give you so I think the consumer

967
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:12,318
needs to pay more attention to um after

968
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:16,279
I drink this pay attention to how you

969
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:18,639
feel right what is the onset you know uh

970
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:21,519
initially when can you feel something

971
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:24,400
and after you feel something how is that

972
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:26,719
time point to to the peak I call it the

973
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,960
ramp right how does the r feel like is

974
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,078
that a appearent or some sometimes you

975
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,880
lose the rep sometimes you feel

976
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:34,680
something but it's going out right you

977
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,640
feel something it's going out so is the

978
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:40,519
rep clear and then when did you Peck

979
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:43,799
right um and then how long the peak last

980
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:46,280
and when did you wear off I think um I

981
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:50,039
think it's a and it's fun to do this

982
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:52,760
it's not a it's fun to collect and uh

983
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:54,440
record and then you can compare between

984
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,319
different skews between different

985
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,440
products how does the product make you

986
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,880
feel I think it's more important than

987
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,318
how does the product taste like

988
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,480
excellent all right Harold thanks again

989
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:08,279
for taking the time um I'd love to put
