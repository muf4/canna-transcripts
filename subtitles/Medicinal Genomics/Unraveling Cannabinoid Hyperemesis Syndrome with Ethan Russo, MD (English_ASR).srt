unraveling the gordian knot and during

our conversation we discuss what is CHS

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,680
and who does it

54
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,878
affect why cases of CHS appear to be on

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,959
the rise possible genetic markers that

56
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:38,439
could indicate CHS

57
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,640
susceptibility steps cannabis users can

58
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,199
take to prevent developing

59
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,679
CHS why some people in the Cannabis

60
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,479
Community don't believe CHS is a real

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,959
thing and much

62
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,158

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,038
my favorites excellent we're happy to

103
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,120
hear that so today we are going to talk

104
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:51,478
about canabo hyperemesis syndrome which

105
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,360
you will be presenting about at Kim at

106
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:58,159
24 in May it's an important topic it's a

107
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,879
controversial Topic in some ways and

108
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,240
appears to be a growing problem but

109
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,639
before we get into all of that I'm sure

110
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,879
there are some people watching or

111
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,519
listening who aren't familiar with CHS

112
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,319
so can you give us a rundown sure so

113
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:16,399
this is a condition that was first

114
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,839
published in 2004 in Australia um based

115
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,839
on several cases with an index case

116
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,560
going back to

117
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:26,478
1996 now what's interesting is usually

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,720
when something's reported for the first

119
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,439
time you have a real evolution of the

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,800
description however they nailed it

121
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,719
pretty much from the start so what they

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:41,199
were describing was a situation in which

123
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,880
uh chronic cannabis users uh developed a

124
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,879
syndrome in which they had nausea

125
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:50,639
vomiting abdominal pain often cyclic

126
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,319
that seemingly was relieved by hot water

127
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,038
bathing and some of the patients

128
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,720
involved would spend hours in the tub or

129
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,159
the shower um to try and relieve

130
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,120
symptoms

131
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:08,039
um so uh this gradually has become more

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,840
frequent either ascertainment has

133
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,759
improved or uh what many of us think is

134
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:17,959
that it's become more prevalent over

135
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,598
time with the greater prevalence of high

136
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:22,918
potency cannabis materials and this

137
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:25,560
seems mainly tied to

138
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:30,519
THC but we should point out that it's

139
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:34,038
really an issue with any CB1 cannaboid 1

140
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:37,598
receptor Agonist because the problem has

141
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:39,719
also been described in people who are

142
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:42,560
using some of the

143
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,840
synthetics uh the H potency synthetics

144
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,598
CB1 Agonist in total absence of cannabis

145
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,799
usage uh so clearly that's the problem

146
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:55,000
um there have been other people that

147
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,759
thought or would like to attribute this

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,839
to pesticide exposure but certainly

149
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,280
people get this even even with

150
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:07,119
organically grown cannabis um and like

151
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:10,519
it or not cannabis is the culprit

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,519
here okay um so these bouts with

153
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:15,359
vomiting now as I understand it this

154
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,318
isn't just sort of like an acute

155
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,199
response where you know you kind of have

156
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:23,520
one episode it this is this is going on

157
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:26,240
for quite some time hours sometimes days

158
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:30,439
yeah that's an important distinction

159
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,960
anyone can get sick from can AB if they

160
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:37,439
have exposure all of a sudden to too

161
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:40,439
high a TC level so I I think many people

162
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:43,199
have had the experience of uh using a

163
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,560
vape for the first time or having an

164
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,960
edible that was too powerful and

165
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,199
actually getting sick so this is part of

166
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,158
the problem it's sort of

167
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,199
counterintuitive to people because

168
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:57,038
everybody knows that you use cannabis at

169
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:00,120
least in low dosages to treat nause and

170
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:03,038
vomiting associated with chemotherapy M

171
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,560
so it doesn't make sense to people that

172
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,079
you can have

173
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,000
this reaction that seems illogical

174
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,279
however it's very consistent with what

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,680
we know about

176
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,679
cannabinoids that they have what's

177
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,598
called a basic dose response curve now

178
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,360
to break that down it means that a lot

179
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:25,199
of the cannabinoids will have one

180
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,360
activity at a low dose and an opposite

181
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,840
activity at a much higher dose and so

182
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,120
that explains

183
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:36,918
how people can get sick from THC acutely

184
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,120
but that's quite different from CHS

185
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:44,639
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome because

186
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:47,959
that is a Subacute or chronic problem

187
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:51,559
where people um will have these

188
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:55,838
increasing bouts of attacks of nausea

189
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:59,039
vomiting and abdominal pain um and uh

190
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,959
basically they go on until they abstain

191
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,199
um

192
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,359
as we'll get into there are treatments

193
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,640
for it but they're a little different

194
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,759
than what we'd expect as

195
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,078
well right and so you know you describe

196
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:15,278
sort of this cyclic vomiting and there

197
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:18,278
is a condition cyclic vomiting syndrome

198
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:21,600
which has a lot of similarities to CHS

199
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:23,600
yes yeah I don't like to think that

200
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,399
they're similar uh this is a really

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,839
distinct diagnosis so uh cyclic vomiting

202
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,000
syndrome um is something that usually

203
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,200
appears in

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,480
children um and what will happen is with

205
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,519
no apparent reason a child will uh

206
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,800
develop nause and vomiting now what's

207
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:47,078
interesting about this is it seems to be

208
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:50,399
what's called a form fru frustrated form

209
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:53,399
of migraine so these are people that go

210
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,759
on subsequently to develop more classic

211
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,159
migraine symptoms and almost invariably

212
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:03,120
there is a family history of migraine

213
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:06,799
so this response to prophylactic

214
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,600
treatment for migraine um I went in my

215
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,120
career as a pediatric neurologist I

216
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,480
actually treated a

217
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,600
six-month-old uh his pediatrician was

218
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,759
sharp enough to realize that we've got

219
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,680
these episodic vomiting uh

220
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:24,480
situations strong family history could

221
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,639
it be cyclic vomiting so we used a

222
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,639
benign drug called cyproheptadine just

223
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,078
at night in a low dose

224
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,759
and the problem disappeared uh so that

225
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,078
was sort of a

226
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:40,039
confirmation the interesting thing is

227
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:43,199
there can be some overlap um this is a

228
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:45,639
situation in which older people who

229
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,480
continue with the cyclic vomiting

230
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:52,440
symptoms benefit from Cannabis because

231
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,920
cannabis helps with migraine so for the

232
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,600
non Discerning clinician that's not

233
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,078
asking the right questions these two

234
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,959
conditions can get confused

235
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,120
and one other point I'd like to make

236
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:08,319
about this uh in cyclic vomiting

237
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,639
syndrome there has been a mutation that

238
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,959
has been noted in the CB1 receptor Gene

239
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,560
which is something we did not find um in

240
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:23,638
the CHS patients at least uh in the

241
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:26,879
sample that we had uh so this is a a

242
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:30,560
diagnostic um distinction between the

243
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:33,039
two syndromes as well interesting no and

244
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:37,679
you and you mentioned

245
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:40,958
that the some physicians may incorrectly

246
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,199
diagnose chhs as

247
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,078
CVS um and so and I think you alluded to

248
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,560
it earlier that you know this could be

249
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,439
the reason why we're seeing cases of

250
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:54,479
CHS get larger as more clinicians are

251
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,560
sort of becoming aware of it um is that

252
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
one of the reasons why it it's climbing

253
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,239
and actually I think you already

254
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,079
addressed that I think my question was

255
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,079
going to be how many cases are we seeing

256
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:08,000
now and how how has that kind of grown

257
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:11,599
sure so they're wildly diverging

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,679
estimates um there was a

259
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,120
gastroenterology uh survey of some kind

260
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,719
and they estimated that nationally in

261
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,959
the US there were probably

262
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,560
350,000 people that had this W was

263
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,879
another study with really questionable

264
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,518
methodology was done in Bellevue

265
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:33,799
Hospital

266
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:37,519
in New York City um and they talked to

267
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:39,879
people who did not come in for CHS ask

268
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,399
them about their cannabis usage and

269
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:46,439
whether they ever uh took hot showers to

270
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,639
reduce nausea and based on that they

271
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,880
made an estimate of two and a half

272
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,519
million people in the US as if New York

273
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,919
City was somehow representative of the

274
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,440
country at

275
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,000
large doesn't wash um

276
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,079
I think that there are a lot of people

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,320
that are affected like this the true

278
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:08,479
figure is probably somewhere in between

279
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,320
but we honestly don't know and this is

280
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,600
something we want to study more closely

281
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,240
uh we're currently putting together a

282
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,360
Consortium of people in different

283
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,919
disciplines to try and and mount a a

284
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,519
bigger

285
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:30,078
study um yeah so it it's very hard to

286
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:33,959
say um clearly we know who at risk and

287
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:37,879
this would be people who are using uh a

288
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:40,559
lot of cannabis generally um in a Sur

289
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:46,799
our survey which was the biggest to date

290
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:51,119
of over 500 people um the average usage

291
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:54,919
in the folks with a diagnosis of CHS was

292
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,600
four grams a day a verbal material uh

293
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,120
and you know it was a mixed thing some

294
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,000
people smoke some vaporized mainly it

295
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,720
with smoking and almost exclusively of

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,480
high THC material so is this getting

297
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,680
more frequent well we need to consider

298
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,720
various factors one I alluded to earlier

299
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:18,159
and that was it for sure is the case

300
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,278
that the availability of high THC

301
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:24,198
potency material is increased nationally

302
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:27,198
so that that certainly is a factor the

303
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:30,958
other is um there is an increasing

304
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:34,799
recognition of C HS so it may be more

305
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:37,919
read readily diagnosed but at the same

306
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:41,359
time there is an over diagnosis

307
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:44,198
possibility because it we've heard of

308
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,240
many cases in which someone comes in to

309
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,719
the emergency room and they've got

310
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,360
nausea and vomiting the question is

311
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,680
asked do you use cannabis and if the

312
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,240
answer is yes they're pegged um probably

313
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,519
inappropriately is having this that

314
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,799
again is Bad Medicine that's a byproduct

315
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,959
of the pressure that Physicians are

316
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:09,559
under to see everybody in 10 minutes or

317
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:12,078
less um you're lucky to get somebody to

318
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:15,719
touch you these days uh because of an

319
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,039
overreliance on technology um but anyway

320
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,720
another

321
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,599
topic right so going back to sort of the

322
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,879
the heavy usage and kind of defining

323
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,879
that so you said four grams now is that

324
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:30,679
like of the actual weight of um the

325
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,720
Cannabis or is that like the actual like

326
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,638
if you were going to have it be

327
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,240
milligrams of THC like it's 4,000

328
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,759
milligrams of THC yeah we could break it

329
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,360
down but then you get into the whole

330
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,800
thing of the bioavailability you know we

331
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:49,199
know that a gram of cannabis if it were

332
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:52,198
20% um uh THC it doesn't people aren't

333
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:54,919
getting 200 milligrams of THC when they

334
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:57,479
smoke it's a fraction of that it it's

335
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:59,958
probably more like 30 milligrams which

336
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,600
is still plenty

337
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:07,039
um but you know I guess an interesting

338
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,560
question is is there a threshold amount

339
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:13,120
right this begins clearly not and it

340
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:17,039
varies from person to person but one

341
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,318
pattern is that this often will develop

342
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,159
after a period of time in other words um

343
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:24,120
you don't necessarily get it the first

344
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,360
time you get involved with cannabis

345
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,480
usually it follows some period of

346
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,480
escalation of dose with the development

347
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,278
of

348
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,120
Tolerance and that's a particular risk

349
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:39,159
with vape pens with their High potency

350
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,198
uh because even users admit that uh

351
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:45,240
they're often using more to chase a

352
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:47,838
certain level of high that they desire

353
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,278
uh so that places people at risk clearly

354
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,920
but there no uh sure cut offs uh you

355
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:57,439
know a point below which you're okay and

356
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:00,120
above which you're at risk it's it's not

357
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,600
that cut and dry

358
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,278
yeah another thing that stood out to me

359
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,919
too is that at least in the survey that

360
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,400
you had the the vast majority of folks

361
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,038
were inhaling cannabis whether smoking

362
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,679
or doing vaporization do we also see

363
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:17,359
symptoms or C CHS emerge from Edibles

364
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,240
yeah you sure can I mean you know when

365
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,599
it gets into the brain it doesn't

366
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,519
discern whether it was G got there

367
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,438
through the digestive tract or the

368
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:29,558
respiratory tract so um yeah it's it's

369
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,038
more likely much more likely with

370
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:35,839
smoking because that's what typically

371
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:40,240
people do additionally with smoking you

372
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:43,359
get a very rapid upward Peak on the dose

373
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,839
response uh whereas with oral

374
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:51,319
Administration it's a slower

375
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:53,959
onset um so smoking clearly uh it's more

376
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:57,639
likely to produce ups and downs that

377
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,480
lead to repetitive dosing that will lead

378
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,480
to tolerance more readily um but people

379
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,558
should not think that they're immune

380
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:11,440
from susceptibility to this by eating uh

381
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:12,960
cannabis products okay and now wonder if

382
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,798
you could kind of explain what we think

383
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,919
is sort of going on here because I'm

384
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:19,679
again I'm not a scientist I'm not a

385
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,679
physician but there is mention of you

386
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:27,519
know down regulation of the CB1 receptor

387
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:30,559
um so explain that well the way our

388
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:34,158
receptors work is if they're getting um

389
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:37,879
too much input they will involute sort

390
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:40,360
of fold back in or become inactive um

391
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,120
now if there's too much of that it means

392
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,839
that you actually will be deficient in

393
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,839
endoc can abinoid function right so I

394
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,959
mean that's one Theory the problem we

395
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,119
know that this happens you know that's

396
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,759
been demonstrated through animal work

397
00:18:53,119 --> 00:19:01,000
that if you keep exposing the animal to

398
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:03,599
high amounts of THC or CB1 Agonist that

399
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,200
their receptors are going to reduce in

400
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:09,000
number or become

401
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,400
inactive um however this is not

402
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,679
something that's easily studied in

403
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,519
humans um we don't you know for instance

404
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,159
you could look at endoc canabo levels in

405
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:23,359
the serum but that doesn't necessarily

406
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:26,000
tell you what's going on in the brain

407
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,959
additionally that's very hard to study

408
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,079
um because the endoc canabo is in the

409
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,880
blood

410
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:33,399
are extremely

411
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,520
unstable a blood sample has to be

412
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,000
immediately put under liquid nitrogen

413
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:42,480
and got into a specialty lab and it's

414
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,720
just not commonly done similarly

415
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,599
um there's the possibility of using

416
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,759
positron emission tomography on an

417
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:54,879
extremely expensive and not widely

418
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,839
available test um to assess receptor

419
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,200
function in the brain but again this

420
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:03,279
hasn't been done on CHS and it's really

421
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,798
embryonic at this stage in terms of its

422
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:10,359
development similarly you could try to

423
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:12,440
look at um anandamide or 2 AG levels in

424
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:16,839
the spinal fluid by doing a lumber

425
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:22,440
puncture spinal tap but um that's not

426
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:23,839
something you do on everybody um yeah so

427
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,200
right now that's

428
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:32,158
theoretical but what we can tell now um

429
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,880
you know so between 2004 and the present

430
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,039
there wasn't a lot of explanation of

431
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,280
what CHS was from now there have been

432
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:46,079
again studies that showed that a marked

433
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:51,240
upregulation of the hypothalamic P

434
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:54,199
pituitary um system um so basically

435
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,400
stress responses now you bet if you're

436
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,679
in pain and you're nauseated and

437
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,159
vomiting

438
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:06,080
you got stress but I mean this is really

439
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,600
serious stress um this isn't you know

440
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,558
simple situation of of vomiting a couple

441
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:14,678
of times because of a virus um people

442
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:17,558
lose weight um they get merked

443
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,559
abnormalities uh sometimes of

444
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:21,079
electrolytes you know the mineral

445
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:24,158
balance in the blood and they've

446
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:27,399
actually been two deaths attributed to

447
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:32,799
this because of how bad the vomiting was

448
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:37,759
from ch s um so you know there are

449
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:40,400
certain markers but until um recently we

450
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,640
didn't have an explanation for this why

451
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,640
does one person get it and another one

452
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,880
doesn't so this is the reason we wanted

453
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:52,440
to examine it with the hypothesis that

454
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,120
perhaps certain people have a genetic

455
00:21:52,440 --> 00:22:00,278
susceptibility to this so that's what we

456
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:03,759
wanted to test um so uh with endocan

457
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:07,079
health uh we put together a study uh

458
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:12,119
starting with a survey again of over 500

459
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:14,798
people and um we for entry as a CHS

460
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,639
patient we had very strict criteria we

461
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:20,119
didn't want there to be mistakes so

462
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,640
first thing was they had to carry a

463
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:25,959
diagnosis of CHS in other words somebody

464
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,840
had seen them and said that this wasn't

465
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,400
what it was um then additionally they

466
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,519
had to have active symptoms we didn't

467
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,640
want people in that may have been

468
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,440
misdiagnosed as having CHS but we're

469
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,679
okay now in other words they didn't

470
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,480
really have it um so that whittel things

471
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:51,240
down

472
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:54,880
um we um we got it down to uh something

473
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:59,038
like 200 candidates and um they were

474
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,159
offered um genetic testing which is done

475
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,839
with a swab in the mouth um to look at

476
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,320
the

477
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,678
DNA unfortunately there was a lot of

478
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:11,678
attrition between step two and step

479
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:14,559
three uh because only 28 CHS confirmed

480
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,679
CHS patients returned the kit after all

481
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:20,079
of them had said that they wanted

482
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:22,519
it the reason for that was we had a

483
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:25,439
great deal of push back from the Cs

484
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:28,240
online community there were people that

485
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,720
questioned our motives um thought we

486
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,919
were in this for the money um didn't

487
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,919
like our methodology for one reason or

488
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,480
another and so there was an active

489
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:43,240
movement to uh tell people not to

490
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,240
participate um so that wasn't helpful um

491
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,400
and then we needed to compare them to to

492
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,120
somebody so there were some people who

493
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,320
took the survey that were high uh volume

494
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:58,399
cannabis users um interestingly about

495
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:00,678
the same four grams a day who didn't

496
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,798
have CHS symptoms and didn't have a

497
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,600
diagnosis so th those were the

498
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:08,000
comparison

499
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:11,319
groups um what we found was a little

500
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,038
surprising so the first hypothesis was

501
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:16,240
well there's got to be a problem with

502
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,480
the CB1 Gene the gene that codes for the

503
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,079
CB1

504
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,960
receptor um we didn't see that as

505
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:26,759
mentioned previously you do see that in

506
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,640
uh cyclic vomiting syndrome so instantly

507
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,919
we had uh

508
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,399
uh difference between the two

509
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:37,640
syndromes we also hypothesize two other

510
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:40,558
things that it could be a problem with

511
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,600
the metabolism of THC how it's broken

512
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:46,000
down we did get confirmation of that

513
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:49,359
because there was a statistically

514
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,759
significant difference in a mutation in

515
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:58,639
a um cyp 2c9 Gene between the CHS

516
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:02,119
patients and the heavy usage cannabis

517
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:06,000
that didn't have symptoms so

518
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:07,479
cyp2c9 is the um enzyme in the liver

519
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,159
that breaks down

520
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,319
THC so you might understand if there

521
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,919
were a mutation there perhaps that it

522
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:19,359
wasn't as efficient in breaking down THC

523
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,038
that levels would be higher and this

524
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:27,319
could produce this funny

525
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:29,440
reaction um the third um hypothesis that

526
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:34,200
we have was that there would be an issue

527
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,679
with the trpv1 trip V1 Gene we thought

528
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,399
of that because one of the interesting

529
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:45,320
things about CHS is that hot water

530
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:48,000
exposure seems to help and interestingly

531
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:51,119
something else that's hot application of

532
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,640
capsus anointment on the skin the active

533
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,000
ingredient and Chili Peppers also

534
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,278
temporarily relieve symptoms uh that

535
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,759
turned out to be the case too again we

536
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:05,278
saw a statistically significant

537
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:08,558
difference uh in the number of mutation

538
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:11,159
seen in the CHS patients and the trip V1

539
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,558
Gene is compared to the high volume

540
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:18,039
cannabis users without

541
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:20,879
CHS um so uh then there were a couple of

542
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:23,000
things we hadn't uh

543
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,600
hypothesized there were two genes

544
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,038
related to dopamine metabolism with

545
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:34,240
abnormalities uh one was uh for the gene

546
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:38,599
that codes the dopamine type 2 uh

547
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,278
receptor um this is an interesting uh

548
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:46,519
receptor in that it's the target for

549
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:48,798
antipsychotic drugs um and um when

550
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:51,000
people have a mutation there as we saw

551
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:54,519
in the CHS patients they're at risk for

552
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,440
a whole bunch of things um addiction to

553
00:26:54,519 --> 00:27:00,038
other

554
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:03,840
substances um also uh risk for psychosis

555
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:07,240
and other psychiatric issues to a strong

556
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,480
degree whether it be um depression

557
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,120
anxiety

558
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:16,399
Etc there was also a mutation in What's

559
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:19,599
called the CT catacol omey transferase

560
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:23,798
Gene this is the gene that breaks down

561
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:27,719
dopamine um and again if uh there were a

562
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:31,519
problem there um you might get a buildup

563
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:35,038
of dopamine that would um provoke

564
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:37,398
addictive behavior or that kind of thing

565
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,000
right and then there was one that made

566
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:41,439
sense though because all of what we've

567
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,798
mentioned so

568
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:49,120
far um sort of

569
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:52,359
um it informs the symptomatology and

570
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:56,278
phenomenology of CHS meaning that it

571
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:58,959
helps explain some of the symptoms um

572
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:01,880
you know

573
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,319
trpv1 among other things has to do with

574
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,840
propulsion in the gut if things aren't

575
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,119
moving you will tend to vomit um it also

576
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,959
is in the brain and is associated with

577
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:16,599
anxiety and pain um so things begin to

578
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,960
make a lot more sense but the fifth

579
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,918
mutation that we saw was something we

580
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,919
had not expected um this is a gene

581
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,440
called abca1 that has to do with

582
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,120
cholesterol

583
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,600
metabolism

584
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:33,479
and this one's a little ominous because

585
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,678
people who have mutations on this Gene

586
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,960
may be susceptible to a number of

587
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,240
problems later in life specifically

588
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:46,840
coronary artery disease type 2 diabetes

589
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,640
militis um and Alzheimer disease so we

590
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:52,959
do not know yet um because this hasn't

591
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,440
been around yet our folks with CHS that

592
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,840
have this mutation at greater risk for

593
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,480
these disorders the ansers quite

594
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:05,558
possibly yes so this takes on another

595
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:08,159
dimension of Public Health uh relevance

596
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:11,079
that we really need to be

597
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,840
examining so yeah so a lot of different

598
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:15,918
genes kind of in play here so it's it

599
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,720
sounds like they might have some

600
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,440
mutations that sort of give them a

601
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,480
propensity to over maybe overuse or

602
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,159
become reliant on cannabis which would

603
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,399
get them into the higher dose range to

604
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:30,440
sort of trigger this and then also have

605
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:33,359
additional mutations that might bring on

606
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,880
these symptoms that that right yeah it's

607
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,918
exactly right now uh certainly before

608
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,960
and in the interim we've had the

609
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:45,159
occasion to hear from a lot of people at

610
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,798
CHS and For Better or Worse a lot of

611
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:52,480
them have had substance abuse issues

612
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:56,319
with other drugs um so what we have seen

613
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,240
and heard corroborates uh the genetic

614
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,480
findings

615
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,558
right and now is the thought that you

616
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,839
know genetic screening could be used to

617
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:07,720
sort of inform folks like you might be

618
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:11,038
at risk at this you know kind of proceed

619
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:15,000
with caution or yeah I think that would

620
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:16,519
be reasonable let's Envision a SE a

621
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,200
scenario in

622
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,960
which

623
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,960
um we have a teenager and his older

624
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,319
brother has had problems with

625
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:30,360
CHS um he's under peer pressure to start

626
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:33,599
using cannabis um might be a good idea

627
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:36,199
to to use this as a screening device and

628
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:40,759
we should make a distinction there this

629
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:43,679
isn't a diagnostic test per se where um

630
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:46,359
you know your blood sugar is above a

631
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,360
certain level what we're looking at here

632
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,000
is a

633
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,278
tendency for example we could have

634
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,480
someone that had mutations on all five

635
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:57,638
genes and there were some patients that

636
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,000
had this but if they never exceeded did

637
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:02,479
a certain threshold of cannabis usage

638
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,200
they might never have a problem with

639
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,798
nause and vomitting uh they'd be at risk

640
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,720
but that doesn't mean that they'd be

641
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:17,158
have the syndrome um so again um the

642
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,120
trigger is having the symptom scenario

643
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,960
uh that fits the

644
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,359
description great now I did want to

645
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,200
we've kind of touched on it a bit but I

646
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,398
wanted to maybe ask directly so as far

647
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,360
as treatments go we've mentioned

648
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:33,959
capsacin um I know that there's others

649
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:36,278
but as I understand it the only real

650
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,880
cure for this is to abstain from

651
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:41,638
Cannabis and is that one must abstain

652
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,039
for the rest of their lives or is there

653
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:46,759
a certain um layoff period that then

654
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:48,960
they can kind of resume cannabis how

655
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:52,798
does that work well we've seen this

656
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,519
scenario repeatedly uh where somebody

657
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,519
has CHS they stop for a while the

658
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,558
symptoms Abate and then they go back to

659
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:05,798
cannabis um and almost

660
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:09,759
invariably um they have a relapse into

661
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:12,200
CHS um people can go a long time I mean

662
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:16,480
we've heard of people stopping for six

663
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:19,319
months sort of edging back in uh you

664
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,720
know and they might do okay for a while

665
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:25,119
um but you know if they again uh start

666
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,319
to edge up on the dosage and develop

667
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,199
tolerance then they're likely to get hit

668
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:34,519
again now another issue is can they use

669
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,840
other types of cannabis we tried to see

670
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:39,519
uh advise people to try well you know

671
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,480
try CBD only products and see what

672
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:45,038
happens right what we usually heard was

673
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,960
they did okay for a time but then things

674
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:51,440
came back now that's complicated from a

675
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:55,480
scientific standpoint by the fact that

676
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,880
most pure CH CBD products aren't pure

677
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,480
CBD um you you know it's one of the

678
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,440
funny things about the plant that the

679
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:08,639
enzyme that that makes CBD uh cbda

680
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:12,720
synthes also makes THC in small amounts

681
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:15,839
um so the plant does that and uh as we

682
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:21,240
know lab analyses are not always

683
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:23,839
reliable in this field um and so a lot

684
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:28,200
we'll call it in this instance a lot of

685
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:30,959
CBD preparations are contaminated with t

686
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,480
that isn't necessarily supposed to be

687
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,919
there so we don't know the answer to

688
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,798
that yet would it be possible that there

689
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,320
are other components of cannabis that

690
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:43,960
could help with this or be

691
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:47,000
utilized um that don't provoke the

692
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:49,480
problem I think the answer is is sure

693
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,919
possible uh but we don't know that yet

694
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,679
and so the only reasonable advice is

695
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,799
once somebody has this is our

696
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,320
recommendation is to abstain from

697
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:03,918
Cannabis and again I'd

698
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:06,359
emphasize um that this has been

699
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,039
described and well documented in people

700
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:12,519
using synthetic

701
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:16,918
cannabinoids um with no uh herbal input

702
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:20,239
so it's not related to pesticides which

703
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:22,918
have toxicities but very different ones

704
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,239
from what we see in CHS there were also

705
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:29,279
some theories out there it could be have

706
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:33,878
something to do with hop latent vroid

707
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,399
right however to date there is no virus

708
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:39,918
affecting plants that's jumped to humans

709
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:42,440
number one number two um it's really a

710
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:46,239
total leap in logic to think that this

711
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,639
has something to do with hop L and vroid

712
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,719
that's a problem but it's not causing

713
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,039
this

714
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:55,918
problem yeah and you mentioned that

715
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:59,599
other non-cannabis CB1 agonists can sort

716
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:03,039
of trigger this what about endogenous uh

717
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,400
canabo endoc canabo anandamide 2 AG um

718
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:07,320
you know I know that those can sort of

719
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,280
be elevated after exercise or something

720
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,720
like that are there any cases of that

721
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,720
maybe triggering

722
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:16,159
about uh I guess that's possible but

723
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:19,480
again we don't have a basis for saying

724
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:22,118
that that's a factor um the place where

725
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,480
you see an excess of endoc canabo

726
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:29,240
function is usually in relation to uh

727
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:33,440
metabolic syndrome or uh type two

728
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:38,319
diabetes um and you know to date I'm not

729
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:42,358
aware of folks with those conditions

730
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:46,000
um uh getting it from exercise for

731
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:48,440
example um so again that's a interesting

732
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,760
theoretical question we just can't say

733
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,838
that um that's a factor right now sure

734
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,359
and now do folks who have CHS do they

735
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,119
have other

736
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:02,119
um endoc canabo system related

737
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,640
dysfunction after they've sort of

738
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:07,280
developed the

739
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:10,759
condition um yeah that's really

740
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,079
possible um something else we've noticed

741
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,400
is a lot of folks with CHS have

742
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,359
unhealthy

743
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,720
Lifestyles um we've heard a lot about uh

744
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:24,318
junk food

745
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:27,559
um having a a sort of American diet

746
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:30,639
That's Heavy on pro-inflammatory

747
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:35,639
input rather than anti-inflammatory

748
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:40,358
input um and again use of other

749
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:45,039
substances uh Alcohol Tobacco Coke

750
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:47,559
opioids um again a strong thread of uh

751
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,079
dependency on

752
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:53,838
drugs okay and now I know we touched on

753
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,960
it before that especially online there

754
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:59,078
is sort of a vocal group of folks who

755
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,440
are sort of skeptical that CHS even

756
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:04,839
exists and I and looking at some of the

757
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,838
results from your um your survey here

758
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:10,199
folks who even have CHS are are

759
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,639
skeptical that THC could be the problem

760
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:15,598
um is that still the case is the tide

761
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,159
sort of changing a bit well I can't

762
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,200
remember the name of the movie but

763
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:22,879
Anthony Hopkins character in this movie

764
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:26,118
once told these kids wishing does not

765
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,599
make it so um and that's certainly the

766
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,599
case here

767
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:36,279
um I'm not sure how to phrase this but

768
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,440
um folks with CHS as a group are often

769
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,079
very skeptical of the medical community

770
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,318
and what they've been told about this

771
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,880
disorder um there is no doubt in my mind

772
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:51,079
that this exists um we have shown with

773
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,880
statistical significance difference

774
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:58,519
between folks that Express these

775
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,640
problems as compared to folks who use an

776
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:03,559
equal amount of cannabis that don't have

777
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:07,000
the problem there is a difference this

778
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:11,920
is real and needs to be taken

779
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:15,440
seriously and is this common amongst

780
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,680
folks who use cannabis for medicine um

781
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,760
because I know that that can sometimes

782
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:24,838
be in high doses sure uh fortunately

783
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:27,520
much much less often um now the reason

784
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:31,039
is clear and that is there's usually a

785
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:33,719
big difference in dose daily dosing uh

786
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,838
between someone who's using

787
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:39,239
recreationally we'll call it as as

788
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:43,318
compared to controlling symptoms whether

789
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:45,559
it be pain spasticity Etc however we are

790
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:48,679
aware of medical patients who have been

791
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:50,838
affected the numbers are very small and

792
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:56,519
I think it's usually attributable to the

793
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:59,078
dose again we suspect um that um in

794
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:03,400
inhalation places a higher risk as

795
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:07,480
opposed to more steady oral dosing for

796
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:11,680
example um so there's some risk if

797
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:15,559
someone's susceptible uh but um I'd say

798
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:19,118
that numbers of medical patients who've

799
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:22,679
been affected with CHS are very

800
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,280
small okay so so sort of where do we go

801
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:26,719
from here where do we go with this

802
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:30,119
information how should folks who Joy

803
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:33,239
cannabis sort of proceed with caution or

804
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:36,318
okay well a couple of things first um

805
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,799
people should be judicious in their

806
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:40,639
dosing um they should be aware that if

807
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,280
they're using High potency material

808
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:47,118
they've got to use less you know um um I

809
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,160
would hope that people would be

810
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,039
satisfied with a certain level of high

811
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:56,159
and not push the limits to the

812
00:39:52,039 --> 00:40:00,800
stratosphere or Beyond um you know I'm

813
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:03,920
how high can you get um so that's one

814
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,440
thing the other thing uh different

815
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,440
Direction Where Do We Go From Here in

816
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,720
terms of additional research um we are

817
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,079
again putting together a Consortium of

818
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:20,199
folks where we want to get bigger

819
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:23,039
numbers and really examine uh this in um

820
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:25,919
a variety of different disciplines to

821
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,199
see what else we can find out um are

822
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,440
there traditional genetic associations

823
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:34,159
and I'll just mention one that's

824
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:38,079
interesting um in our survey we asked

825
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:41,519
about um whether women who were affected

826
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,240
who had had children had hyperemesis

827
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:47,280
gravidarum which is a morning sickness

828
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:49,118
on steroids whether they'd been affected

829
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,319
with that during their pregnancies and

830
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,318
the numbers were very high um recently

831
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:59,480
uh genetic susceptibility to hyperemesis

832
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:02,639
gravidarum has been Associated now we

833
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,000
didn't see mutations on that Gene but we

834
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:09,799
weren't looking for them either um so

835
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,960
having another crack at this with larger

836
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,280
numbers of people we can hone in on that

837
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,920
or see what other chance associations

838
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,040
there may be because we found them

839
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,440
already we didn't know about the

840
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:26,480
association with dopamine metabolism nor

841
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,838
with cholesterol metabolism and again um

842
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,838
beyond the issue of how much cannabis

843
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:34,519
people use these have important

844
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:38,759
implications on a public health level

845
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:43,039
you know what risks do people with these

846
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:45,640
traits have um you know I I think it

847
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,759
goes without saying that in medicine we

848
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:52,078
need to be much more effective at

849
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:54,400
prevention it's always better to deal

850
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,839
with the problem before it becomes acute

851
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,240
or chronic um and you know exceeds the

852
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:04,119
threshold where it's affecting someone's

853
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:07,559
lifestyle um

854
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:09,440
so having this knowledge may be a big

855
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:12,279
Advantage going

856
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,200
forward one other Factor sure there's

857
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,280
the cost factor involved with this I

858
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:20,598
hadn't mentioned um there was a study

859
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,920
done in 2012 so you know not even that

860
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:27,000
recently and they found then the average

861
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,599
patient who received a CH

862
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,318
diagnosis had spent

863
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:36,960
$96,000 in tests or ER visits and

864
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:41,159
Associated costs before they got the

865
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:44,199
diagnosis that's crazy um you know again

866
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:47,598
if we can identify this earlier uh it's

867
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:50,679
going to be to everyone's benefit and

868
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,318
pocketbook most definitely and in

869
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:55,279
circling back to sort

870
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:57,920
of you know limiting one's consumption I

871
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,720
know that one thing that Dustin sulac um

872
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,800
always talks about is sort of taking a

873
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:05,919
tolerance break that you know whether

874
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:09,039
it's weekly or ever ever um frequently

875
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,838
to sort of reset one's tolerance so they

876
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:14,318
don't need to use such higher doses uh

877
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:17,679
could that be a reasonable thing to to

878
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:19,599
do to try to prevent this yeah it may

879
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:22,679
well be helpful and particularly in

880
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,318
relation to Medical users he uses the

881
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:28,719
resensitization procedure when he thinks

882
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:31,679
that someone take Taking atypically high

883
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:35,480
doses to treat their condition so very

884
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:38,960
briefly how it's done is ension totally

885
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:42,240
for 48 hours and then resuming at half

886
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,440
the prior dose now what's fascinating is

887
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,399
usually the efficacy in treating

888
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:51,318
symptoms is as good as it was at the

889
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:53,280
higher dose so yeah um I think if people

890
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:56,519
again are very

891
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,920
judicious about how much and and how

892
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:02,119
often they're using cannabis uh there

893
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,119
will be fewer problems excellent all

894
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:06,240
right so winding down here Ethan U

895
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:08,920
Before I Let You Go I want to give you a

896
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,159
chance to plug any other resources that

897
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,039
you think might be helpful for folks to

898
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:15,639
learn more about this topic or um get in

899
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:19,558
touch with you or learn about the the

900
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:23,558
work that you're doing great so um yeah

901
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:27,319
uh about CHS excuse me there is a

902
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:31,160
website what Dash is

903
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:31,159
