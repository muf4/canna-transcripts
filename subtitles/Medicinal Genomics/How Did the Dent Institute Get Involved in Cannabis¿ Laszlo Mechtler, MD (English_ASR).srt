00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,239
now when did the dent Institute get

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,000
involved in cannabis and was that sort

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:24,598
of a logical fit for you guys illogical

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,960
it was not logical in any way shape or

6
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,000
form um only reason we got into it

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,600
because we take care of so many people

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,480
so when cannabis was was made legal in

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,439
New York State uh about six seven years

10
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:44,479
ago um we were getting phone calls 500 a

11
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,878
day I said no I have no idea about

12
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,878
cannabis i' you know I'm not a smoker

13
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,119
I'm not a user I'm not I don't even use

14
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,640
alcohol which makes me tremendously

15
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,839
boring so the the point is the next day

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,239
was another 500 phone calls the third

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,160
day another 500 phone calls now if you

18
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,399
run a business buiness you can imagine

19
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,000
how much money and energy that takes to

20
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,159
answer those phone calls so I had said

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,438
look let's get into cannabis let's make

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,159
a clinic let's start learning about it

23
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:16,798
so because we're you we're um our

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,000
business model is so private and not

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,079
institutional we're able to set up a

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,438
cannabis clinic and for the next six

27
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:26,959
seven years it took that amount of time

28
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:29,279
to understand the use of cannabis in

29
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,280
patients with neurological symptoms

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,719
including pain and we you know you're

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,519
self-taught I mean where are you going

32
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,719
to go medical school they don't teach it

33
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,478
there where so so the only good places

34
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,519
to learn is at these conferences and so

35
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:46,640
I was honored to be you know at these

36
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:49,920
conferences everywhere from Tel Aviv to

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,359
uh Malta Europe and the United States so

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,200
I've been part of this and I've been

39
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,799
learning as we go and now I feel I have

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,920
an expertise because how do Physicians

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,079
understand medicine they have to see

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,320
patients so right now in the clinic we

43
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,959
have over 13,000 patients on cannabis

44
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,079
for medical reasons so I don't deal with

45
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,400
recreational and I need to emphasize

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,480
that I'm purely on the medical side I'm

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,159
purely there to legitimize this whole

48
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,399
process excellent so was there a was

49
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,919
there a light bulb M or was there a

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,640
specific um piece of evidence that you

51
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,598
saw that you know kind of clicked in

52
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,119
your head that you know there's

53
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,878
something to this cannabis well as

54
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,640
you're seeing patients

55
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,759
as they come up to you and they throw

56
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,279
their arms around you and hug you that's

57
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,199
the changing moment that you found

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,759
something where patients said you

59
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:46,158
changed my life you got me off

60
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,679
opioids my quality of life has improved

61
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:49,799
and With Tears in their eyes they're

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,040
hugging you and saying thank you that's

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,400
the moment that every physician wants in

64
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,639
their life and I got that in cannabis

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,840
interesting enough uh you know I deal

66
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,119
with bad diseases I deal with uh you

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,000
know brain cancer answer it's one of my

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,400
specialties and it's it's you know you

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,199
never get that moment so yeah it changed

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,680
the way I practice uh I still do you

71
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:15,280
know brain tumor research and treatment

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,879
I do uh other things in neurology but

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,280
cannabis has been an eye-opening moment

74
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:23,000
where you can change the quality life of

75
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,360
individuals by understanding how

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,360
cannabis works on human

77
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
beings

78
