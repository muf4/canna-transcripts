Welcome to the Canad Coffee Talk podcast

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,240
where we talk with the leading minds in

4
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:25,359
cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,

5
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:28,000
and safety testing. I am your host, Ben

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,800
Amaralt. I am the senior marketing

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,079
manager at medicinal genomics and proud

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,600
member of the team that puts on the

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:39,120
CANMED summit. Well, we are getting

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,280
closer and closer to CANMED 25, which is

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,519
taking place at the Windham Resort in

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,359
Puerto Rico June 17th through the 20th.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,239
If you are planning to join us in Puerto

14
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,878
Rico this June, don't wait to register.

15
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,878
Our room block at the resort is filling

20
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,118
speaker lineup, our schedule, and our

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,280
unique networking events designed to

22
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,000
connect you with the leaders who are

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,478
shaping the industry. We really do have

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,959
something for everyone at CAMED2 this

25
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:20,158
year. We have the medical practicum

26
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:23,118
where doctors and nurses can earn up to

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,439
six continuing education credits. We

28
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,359
have the cannabis genomics workshop

29
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,679
featuring more than a dozen of the

30
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,200
world's leading experts on plant

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,040
genomics, breeding, and pathogen

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,640
resistance. We have a lab compliance

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,960
workshop covering lab shopping,

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,200
remediation, and other hot topics. And

35
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,798
we also have 20 curated oral

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,079
presentations from the top researchers

37
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,399
in cannabis science, medicine,

38
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:55,279
cultivation, and lab testing, and so

39
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,920
much more. And the great part about

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,239
CANMET is that all of these people from

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,240
the different areas of the industry come

42
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,798
together with the goal to advance

43
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,560
cannabis medicine and the industry as a

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,959
whole. And we really hope that you'll

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,878

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:53,400
KMED2. Our guest today is Dr. Zamir

61
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,598
Punja. Zamir is a professor of plant

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
biotechnology at Simon Frasier

63
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,799
University in Canada. His research

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,439
interests include the edeology and

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,560
management of plant diseases on

66
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,120
vegetable and horicultural crops and the

67
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,640
application of plant biotechnology for

68
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,360
disease management. Since 2018, his work

69
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,679
has shifted to researching cannabis,

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,080
where his group has described a range of

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,040
previously unreported pathogens

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,640
affecting the crop and has evaluated

73
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,919
various methods for disease

74
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,639
management. Using next generation

75
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,518
sequencing, his team identified diverse

76
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,158
fungi, yeast, and bacteria across

77
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,560
multiple plant tissues. Their study

78
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,598
reveals that cannabis plants host

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,878
abundant microbial endoites which can

80
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,959
impact plant health and product quality.

81
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,000
Findings also highlight the influence of

82
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,640
growing substrates and biocrol agents on

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
the cannabis

84
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,878
microbiome. During our conversation, we

85
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,480
discuss what is the microbiome and how

86
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,878
do microbial endes affect plant health?

87
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,079
Identification of common microbes found

88
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,479
in cannabis samples including penicyium

89
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,760
and

90
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,840
fuserium. Whether merist stem tissue

91
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,318
culture is a viable microbial

92
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,319
sterilization

93
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,918
method. The influence of sterilized

94
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,079
versus non-sterilized growing

95
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,959
media. How growers can use microbiome

96
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,360
analysis for early interventions.

97
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,399
future research questions on microbial

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,400
balance and seed microbiome engineering

99
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,918
and

100
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,000
more. Before we get to my conversation

101
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,439
with Samir, I'd like to thank this

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,759
Good afternoon, Zamir. Thank you so much

116
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,279
for joining us on the podcast. Hi.

117
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,919
Thanks, man. Thanks for having me on

118
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,359
here. Glad to be here. Of course. Uh

119
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,038
it's great to have you back on the

120
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,400
podcast. You're one of our favorite

121
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,079
guests and favorite CANMED presenters.

122
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,959
You always have great information about

123
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,719
plant pathogens and plant health. And

124
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,799
you know, I don't know if I've told you

125
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,680
this before, but your KMED22

126
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,160
presentation on cannabis tricoms is the

127
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,038
most watched video on our YouTube page.

128
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,360
It has more than 300,000 views. That's

129
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,879
incredible. I mean I mean I know when I

130
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,120
was getting ready for it presenting it,

131
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,959
I had kind of goosebumps because some of

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
the images that we had presented were

133
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,599
just incredible. And so I'm I'm really

134
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,560
glad that people are catching on to look

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,479
at these fascinating um structures that

136
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,879
obviously contain all the canabonoids

137
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,639
and and tarpen and so on. So that's

138
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,800
good. That's good news. Yeah,

139
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,400
absolutely. It's a visual medium and

140
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,280
those those images are amazing. Um so

141
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,198
K25, we're happy to have you back. um

142
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,599
your presentation this year is going to

143
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,400
be about the cannabis microbiome and

144
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,919
specifically microbial endoes and how

145
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:42,000
they affect plant health. But first, for

146
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,478
those who may be unfamiliar with those

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,439
terms, I guess my first question is can

148
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:50,159
you briefly explain what the microbiome

149
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,360
is and how it affects plant health?

150
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
Yeah. So I mean that you know the

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,879
microbiome was a term that was coined um

152
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,038
a long time ago for human health because

153
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,439
as you know we have microbes in our gut

154
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,519
and elsewhere and those microbes

155
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,240
interact with various aspects of our

156
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,439
body and and and some physicians feel

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,759
that um that composition of microbes has

158
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,079
various implications for for health not

159
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,240
just physical health but in some cases

160
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,318
even your mood swings and and various

161
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,598
other things. So there's a complex

162
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,160
interaction with microbial organisms uh

163
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,000
within human human guts and so that's

164
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,960
carried on to plants. I mean plants

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,598
surprisingly or unsurprisingly also have

166
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,799
a collection of microbes that they seem

167
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:37,279
to interact with um quite a bit and and

168
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,918
those those microbes may be uh in the in

169
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,758
the on the outside. uh in in in the

170
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,758
human case it's all internal microbes

171
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,639
but in plants it can be a combination of

172
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,800
external uh primarily things in the soil

173
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,280
that get in through the roots but we

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,840
also have a subset of the microbiome

175
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,399
that's internal and we refer to that as

176
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,038
the endoes endo meaning inside fight

177
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,478
means plant so there's microbes inside

178
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:04,159
the plant that um to me are also pretty

179
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,519
interesting because what are they doing

180
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,919
there I mean are they are they

181
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,000
beneficials are they causing issues in

182
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,079
the land and that's kind of what drove

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,680
us to start this this whole area of

184
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,918
research.

185
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,240
Excellent. So yeah, what what do we

186
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,318
know? Are they what kind of purpose are

187
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,598
they are they serving? Are they helping

188
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,840
to carry out certain process processes

189
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,878
or or what's going on there? So again,

190
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,478
you know, there's a fair amount of

191
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
literature on these endopites and

192
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,199
microbiomes in other plant species. So

193
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,958
things like wheat and corn and tomato

194
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
and so we can learn stuff from those

195
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,278
plants because again with with cannabis

196
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,918
and hemp I think the the earliest

197
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,679
studies on microbiomes was around 2020.

198
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,199
So we've only been at it for four or

199
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,399
five years and and certainly for

200
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,920
cannabis or the the high THC strains uh

201
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,480
this has only been in progress for about

202
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,879
a year year and a half. So it's

203
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,959
relatively new for for these two crops.

204
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,799
But in other plants, there's these

205
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,479
microbes that sit on the root surface

206
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:05,039
that um seem to help absorb nutrients.

207
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,200
Um there's others that fight off uh you

208
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,278
know, pathogens that might try to gain

209
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,200
access to the roots. And then some of

210
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,838
these microbes enter into the roots, the

211
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,720
the beneficials or the the endopites.

212
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:21,040
And again, um some of the ideas are that

213
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,959
they do have some benefit. Um others,

214
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,199
why would they be there? So, we've taken

215
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,919
the the opposite approach is that there

216
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
may be some in there that are not

217
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,799
beneficial and some of those would

218
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,719
include pathogens, right, that also gain

219
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,719
access to to the inside of the root

220
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,639
structure. And so, there's probably a

221
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,440
battle that goes on between the good and

222
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,679
the bad um within the the plant

223
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,240
structures. That part we haven't quite

224
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,559
figured out yet. Um what we've done up

225
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,600
to now uh using actually medicinal

226
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,239
genomics uh platform is to go through

227
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,320
and and sequence these organisms that

228
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,680
are there using you know what they call

229
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,800
whole genome sequencing where um using

230
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:03,359
your platform we're able to actually um

231
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,519
determine what what the species of these

232
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,560
microbes are based on their sequences of

233
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,039
of DNA. And so we've come up with this

234
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,799
quite a large volume of information that

235
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,399
we're sort of sorting through. I mean

236
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,199
what what does this mean? What is is

237
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,799
this X? Is this Y? Is this Z? And

238
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,959
eventually we'll come up with some sort

239
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,599
of answer to explain what these microbes

240
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:27,359
are doing. Right. And now are you trying

241
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,278
to kind of correlate to um the findings

242
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,240
that you have in the microbiome with,

243
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,838
you know, symptoms or morphology of the

244
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,000
plants themselves to try to make some

245
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,440
connections there? Yeah, that's really

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,519
hard to do, you know, because what we're

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,839
finding is that we there's no plant

248
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,000
there's no cannabis plant that is that

249
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,279
doesn't have a microbiome. Yeah. So, you

250
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
don't have you don't have a starting

251
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,200
point that's zero. So, everything that

252
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,200
we take up already has a microbiome in

253
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,920
it. So, you ask the question, well, if I

254
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
was to add X and Y, is that going to

255
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,519
make a difference or not? But you've

256
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,959
already got, you know, A and B sitting

257
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,440
in there already. And so uh it it makes

258
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,078
the evaluation of these new microbes

259
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,279
that you add more complicated.

260
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,199
Um what what's A and B doing there? Uh

261
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,919
we don't know yet. And so when you add,

262
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,320
you know, X and Y, what does A plus B

263
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,120
plus X and Y do together? We're not

264
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,079
really 100% sure. Um there's about two

265
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,120
or three recent reports that show that

266
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,278
when you do add X and Y back to whatever

267
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,519
is there already, there is some benefits

268
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,838
that you they do see sort of a

269
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,360
enhancement of growth. There's also

270
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,120
apparently an increase in some of the

271
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,839
canabonoids, but we we we need to be

272
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,839
sure that it's a consistent trend that

273
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,680
when you add X and Y that you're

274
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,680
actually going to see what you think

275
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,199
you're going to see, right? It must be

276
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,039
hard to try to control for all those

277
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,399
different variables. There's a ton of

278
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,000
variables and and that doesn't even

279
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,639
include the environment or or the

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,799
cannabis strain that you're using or the

281
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,600
fertilizer that you might be adding. So

282
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,679
that adds a lot of complications to to

283
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,159
what we might see. And again, similar to

284
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,599
the microbiome in our gut, you know,

285
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,120
depending on your diet, depending on

286
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,159
whether you take in a lot of yogurt,

287
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,320
depending on whether you take

288
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,639
antibiotics, that's going to influence

289
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,720
your your microbiome. I know yours is

290
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,039
different from mine because our diets

291
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,040
are completely different. So, there's a

292
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,719
lot of variables that also apply to

293
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,240
plants.

294
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,320
Interesting. Yeah. And when I was

295
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,159
looking through your abstract, I I did

296
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,959
see that there are certain microbes that

297
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,360
you were finding in in all samples. I

298
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:34,319
believe it was penicyium and fuserium.

299
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,079
Um what's the potential implications of

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,600
that? Yeah, so that's that was

301
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,239
interesting as well. Um I mean the

302
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,639
fizerium we know is a pathogen. So, uh,

303
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,320
we need to watch out for that one. And I

304
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,799
guess in hindsight, it wasn't too

305
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,200
surprising because we know fizarium once

306
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,799
it gets into the mother plants, uh, you

307
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,360
take cutings from those plants, you have

308
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,919
a good chance of spreading that fuserium

309
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,919
off into the next cropping cycle. So, we

310
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,759
kind of knew that fizerium was there.

311
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,319
And we've also seen a lot of penicyium.

312
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,159
I mean, penicylium is is what we the

313
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,519
term we use is ubiquitous. It's kind of

314
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,679
everywhere. You know, you fight it in

315
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,600
the air, you fight it in the soil. We

316
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,078
use it to make cheese. We we use it for

317
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,399
various things but um we found

318
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,399
penicylium consistently and and probably

319
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,919
more interesting than that there was one

320
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,240
species penicyium chryogenum which uh in

321
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,719
the early literature back in the 50s and

322
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,839
60s. It was described as the species

323
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,519
that produces the antibiotic penicellin

324
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,839
which we all know is pretty pretty

325
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,320
useful for for helping us combat you

326
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,079
know bacterial infections and so on. So

327
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,399
what is this penicellin producing

328
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,599
penicyium inside the plant doing? Uh

329
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,039
maybe it's fighting off some of the

330
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
fuserium. Maybe it's fighting off

331
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,519
something else. But uh in that in those

332
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,279
two cases, you know, the consistency

333
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,600
suggests to me that there's there's a

334
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,799
role there's a function for that uh

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,320
penicylium inside the plant. And I don't

336
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,399
know if it's producing antibiotics.

337
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,040
Well, that's that's a harder question to

338
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,278
answer, but it's there. And so it must

339
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,360
be doing something. Yeah. And now and

340
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,198
you mentioned that fuserium is is

341
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,000
present in all the tissue samples and

342
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,559
that it is a pathogen. So are these

343
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,198
plants showing symptoms of like a

344
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,198
fuserium infection or is it potentially

345
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,919
at such low levels that it hasn't had a

346
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,599
chance to to cause harm? Yeah, I I think

347
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,879
it's there at such low levels and and

348
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,879
that brings up a good point. This

349
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,360
microbiome sequencing is very very

350
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,000
sensitive. M I mean the the level of

351
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,919
detection may be you know a few cells of

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,879
the of the species that are present

353
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,360
inside the plant. So um when we when we

354
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,958
see a positive of fizarium it doesn't

355
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,039
mean that plant's completely overtaken

356
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,000
by it. It means they may be well for

357
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,838
argument sake 10 spores that we we were

358
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,720
able to pick up with this with this

359
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,720
analytical analytical method. Um, so it

360
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,160
could be just dormant, could be maybe

361
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,879
it's being suppressed, you know, by the

362
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,159
penicellin uh that's inside and then

363
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,879
when you allow it to grow further, it

364
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:02,360
explodes. Um, we we know a lot of these

365
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,039
endopightes are not necessarily

366
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,120
expressing something all the time. The a

367
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,719
lot of them can be what we call latent.

368
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,078
Mhm. It's an infection that you have

369
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,399
kind of like what we used to have when

370
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,078
we had COVID with with no symptoms. You

371
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,159
know, the virus is there but it hasn't

372
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,719
exploded yet. Um, a lot of these

373
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,120
endopites do that. they they stay latent

374
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,120
and then if the plant is stressed or

375
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,278
there's some other environmental factor

376
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,039
they all of a sudden become active and

377
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,480
that could explain what the fizerium is

378
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,360
doing and and possibly the

379
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,440
penicellium. Yeah. And that was going to

380
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,360
be my question because I know that it's

381
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,600
been said before that you know if you

382
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,839
overwater your plants you have an overly

383
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,560
humid environment or it's particularly

384
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,680
damp um you're more prone to like a

385
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:48,159
fuserium infection. So is it that you

386
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,319
know if the conditions are right it can

387
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,078
sort of take off? Yeah. And and you know

388
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,839
it's really hard to get rid of the the

389
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,078
only time where we've actually been able

390
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,959
to see it completely eliminated and

391
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:01,359
again this is using the the U microbial

392
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,439
sequencing platform is is when you do

393
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,440
merist stem culture when you take the

394
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,720
meristan tip which which obviously is

395
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,720
for eradicating viruses and vyroids and

396
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,079
other things. What we found was that the

397
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,160
fusarium was was gone. um it was gone in

398
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,919
in those plants that came out the out of

399
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,600
the out of the tissue culture. And then

400
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,559
I'll just add something more to that and

401
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,959
I'm sure you're going to have a

402
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,958
follow-up question and that is that when

403
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,599
you put those plants out, they get

404
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,958
reinfected really fast. So there's

405
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,759
fizerium flying around in the

406
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,479
environment and for some reason those

407
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,320
marriage stem derived plants seem to be

408
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,720
and I haven't proven this yet more

409
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,920
sensitive to to being to be to being

410
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,079
reattacked. So it's almost like you've

411
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,000
cleaned your entire gut of the

412
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,719
microfllora. You've you've taken a ton

413
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,799
of antibiotics, right? And now the

414
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,639
danger is that whatever comes in next is

415
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,559
going to completely take over because

416
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
it's created this this biological

417
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,039
vacuum, right? So they always say when

418
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,639
you've done a dose of antibiotics, go

419
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,838
back in and and start taking these

420
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,558
beneficial probiotics, right? To to help

421
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,318
reestablish your your gut microfllora.

422
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,318
It may be the same in these plants. Once

423
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,279
you clean it up, you need to make sure

424
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,240
you put something useful back

425
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:17,038
beneficials which would include things

426
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,160
like tricoderma and and other beneficial

427
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,038
fungi. Yeah. No, and you're right. I was

428
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,120
definitely going to have a follow-up to

429
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,359
that, but before we sort of move on, I

430
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,479
just want to talk more about merist stem

431
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,879
tissue culture. Um, and sort of, you

432
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,720
know, the general idea behind that as I

433
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,320
understand it is you're taking such a

434
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,679
small piece of the newest growth that

435
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,678
you're potentially outrunning the

436
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,840
infection, right? The new growth is so

437
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,919
new new that the infection hasn't had a

438
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,839
chance to get there yet. Uh, which makes

439
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,360
a lot of sense. But if I read correctly

440
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,639
in your abstract, you were saying that

441
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,959
some of the bacteria is still present in

442
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,640
the merist stem. Yeah, there were still

443
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,200
a few bacterial cells and you know

444
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,559
bacteria first of all they're so

445
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,640
microscopic and they're very very easy

446
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,119
to move through the vascular tissues in

447
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,280
the plant. So unlike the fungi and maybe

448
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,439
some of the other viruses that sort of

449
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,639
lag behind uh some of these bacteria

450
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,759
were were seemingly making it through.

451
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,000
Um is that good or bad? I don't know. Um

452
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,279
it basically means that you know the the

453
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,279
merist stems aren't completely

454
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,759
completely completely sterile. there may

455
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,240
be some remnants of some bacterial

456
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:29,119
cells. Uh and we know even with viruses

457
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,000
and vyroids that you don't get 100%

458
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:35,359
success rate, you may be at 30 40% um

459
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,480
elimination, but the fungi because

460
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:42,000
they're larger organisms seem to be um

461
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,319
removed from those mar stem tips. Yeah.

462
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,480
No, and I suppose it makes sense too if

463
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,038
if the idea is that there's almost a

464
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,360
symbiotic relationship between the plant

465
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,960
and the microbes that it would be

466
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,918
present even in the new growth because

467
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,440
it may very well be essential. Yeah.

468
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,160
It's doing something that that we still

469
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,080
haven't quite figured out. Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,080
So, another thing that you had touched

471
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:08,240
on earlier was the idea of um taking

472
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,839
cutings. So if the if the mother plant

473
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,839
is infected with I I think it was

474
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,720
fuserium that we're talking about that

475
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,519
the the cutting is going to um have

476
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,759
those same symptoms. So what are some of

477
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,240
the implications there for for so for

478
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,679
growers who rely on that? Yeah. So

479
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,480
that's something where they you have to

480
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,840
be really careful with the with the

481
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,519
fizarium. Um but you know in addition to

482
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,000
fizerium you're also carrying over some

483
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,319
of the endoes the the the good and

484
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,160
possibly the the other bad ones. uh what

485
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,399
we found was that there was a really

486
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
high correlation between the overall

487
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,640
endopytes that you established using

488
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
this microbiome method and the endoyes

489
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,640
that were originally in the in the

490
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,080
mothers which I mean in hindsight you

491
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,320
could say yeah of course we know that

492
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,038
you know mother mother to progeny you

493
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,519
get the transmission but it also implies

494
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,640
that pathogens will move in that

495
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,119
direction as well and um you don't you

496
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,720
can't possibly tissue culture everything

497
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm not suggesting we go and merrist

498
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,160
stem the entire

499
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,038
population of plants. But what you can

500
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,279
do early on uh you know at the time of

501
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:14,519
rooting is where we think a lot of these

502
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,798
endopyes and other microbi micro

503
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,480
microbiome members are getting

504
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,200
established is when the roots are

505
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,000
starting to to be formed. And so we're

506
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,679
thinking that um as you start rooting um

507
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,759
in addition to whatever may already be

508
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,320
there, you can supplement that with

509
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,640
beneficial microbes. Uh and again things

510
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,759
like tracherma, glyocladium, some of the

511
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,320
bacteria come to mind. Um add it in

512
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,440
early so that as the roots start to form

513
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,678
these microbes can get in there and uh

514
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,360
potentially out compete the fizarium and

515
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,159
and some of the other microbes that are

516
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,000
there.

517
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,360
Excellent. Um yeah, and that was another

518
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,759
thing I was going to bring up was this

519
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,839
idea of the grow the the growing medium.

520
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,359
Um because I think it it was said that

521
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,519
sterilizing the the cocoa fiber growing

522
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,519
medium actually

523
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,679
didn't sorry you mentioned that

524
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,839
sterilizing the cocoa fiber growing

525
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,960
medium didn't influence the microbiome

526
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,639
of the cutings grown in them. So what

527
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,558
does that mean in terms of Yeah. So that

528
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,440
so that one's a double-edged sword in in

529
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:23,279
the sense that um there's two aspects to

530
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,519
that. First is that if you've got a

531
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,678
mother plant that's already got

532
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,839
endopytes or other microbes in it and

533
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,400
you take cutings off of that, you'll be

534
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,639
moving along those those particular um

535
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,320
endopy. So we call that horizontal

536
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,720
transmission. It's sort of moving from

537
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:41,918
from one side to the next. Then if you

538
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,319
plant that in a in a substrate um what

539
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,400
you'll find is that the whatever is in

540
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,879
the substrate growing medium doesn't

541
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,120
really have a huge impact on whatever

542
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,960
has already been been established. In

543
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,599
other words, there's sort of a buffering

544
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,159
effect. So that that speaks to perhaps

545
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,279
the the the substrate not having a major

546
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,600
effect. However, if you go backwards and

547
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,000
consider the mother plant and the mother

548
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,918
plant before that, those plants, if

549
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,079
they're planted in a in a substrate that

550
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,640
has a lot of microbes in it, they'll

551
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,199
start absorbing those microbes from the

552
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,320
from the surrounding environment. So uh

553
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,798
if you look at a time course time A, the

554
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,480
substrate becomes very important because

555
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,558
the substrate will influence whatever is

556
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,919
getting into the plant at time A. But

557
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,359
when you take a whole bunch of cutings

558
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,880
all the way to W, X, Y, and Zed, those

559
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,839
microbes that came from that mother

560
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,120
plant seem to be somewhat well

561
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,839
established and then whatever is in the

562
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,359
substrate doesn't seem to make a huge

563
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,000
amount of difference because they're

564
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,918
already established, right? So yes and

565
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,240
no the substrate um can have an

566
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,120
influence um in in in getting that

567
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:53,038
initial population established. This is

568
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:55,359
where I think the best scenario would be

569
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,839
sterilizing that substrate just to be

570
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,158
sure and then adding back in there what

571
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,319
you feel are the beneficials whether

572
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
they be traced or glyocadiums. Get those

573
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,480
set up and then stick your plants in

574
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,880
those. And the idea would be that those

575
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,038
will try to out compete whatever is

576
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,400
already present in the cutings and and

577
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,079
make it a beneficial environment. Yeah,

578
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,720
I suppose that makes sense. If you keep

579
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,879
mom happy, you keep mom healthy when

580
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,919
you're creating your cutings. Try to

581
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,600
um recreate that same substrate for the

582
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,880
cutings and then hopefully that would

583
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,480
continue on. And and I think that's

584
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,600
where this whole idea of living soil

585
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,599
comes in. I mean, I've never

586
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,599
experimented with living soils myself

587
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,199
because we work with with hydroponic

588
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,678
systems where everything has to be, you

589
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,240
know, cleaned. But living soils have the

590
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,038
advantage that they they also carry a

591
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,720
huge uh complex of micro microbiomes or

592
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:50,640
microbes that can have some impact on

593
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,440
the plant that's subsequently grown in

594
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,280
that environment. The only difficulty I

595
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,840
have with living soils is that I don't

596
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,759
know totally what's in there. I think

597
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,599
what we need to do with the microbiome

598
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,240
studies is now start looking at living

599
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,639
soils and finding out exactly what it is

600
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,159
that that we're dealing with. I mean,

601
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,000
you know, living soils do differ. If

602
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,240
you've added a molasses solution to it

603
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,400
or you've added some other organic

604
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,359
fertilizer, that's going to influence

605
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,679
the microbial composition and that could

606
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,278
then impact the plant. So, certainly

607
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,320
they there needs to be more work in that

608
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,079
in that area. Excellent. Now I think

609
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:30,000
we've we've done a good job talking

610
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:32,798
about how endoites microbiome in impacts

611
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,679
plant health. What about concerns about

612
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:38,000
from a consumer standpoint?

613
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,600
Yeah. So I mean you know um one of the

614
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,679
because the the technique is so

615
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,678
sensitive we're finding a lot of

616
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,600
interesting things that we you wouldn't

617
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,519
have been able to culture or grow on

618
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,278
media and so on and so forth. So when

619
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,759
you first look at the data you go oh my

620
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,440
god there's so much stuff here. But we

621
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,640
can't lose can't lose sight of the fact

622
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,120
that every plant, every every vegetable,

623
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,120
every fruit product that we eat is

624
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,959
covered with microbes, right? There's

625
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,879
always a microbiome that's associated

626
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,960
with the tomato that you eat and the

627
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,360
cucumber that you eat. So, we can't lose

628
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,440
lose sight of that. But because cannabis

629
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,639
is more highly regulated, right, they

630
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,798
want to make sure that you don't have

631
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,720
the the negative uh microbiomes present.

632
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:24,158
um it could help uh address the issue of

633
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,480
um these micro micro microbes that like

634
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,320
aspiggilis that we're really concerned

635
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,720
about. How much of that actually

636
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,158
originates with the microbiome itself

637
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,720
and and how much of it is actually

638
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,880
coming in from the external environment.

639
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,839
The data we're seeing suggests that

640
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,919
aspiggillis is not huge. It's not huge

641
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,918
in the microbiome itself as the plants

642
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,600
are growing. So they're not like

643
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,840
harboring it and picking it up and

644
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,879
storing it like

645
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,879
penicyium. U it may be that the

646
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
aspigilus is an external factor, right?

647
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,960
It's coming in maybe through uh high

648
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,000
humidity conditions or poor growing

649
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,600
conditions or or poor drying conditions.

650
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,278
And if that's the case, then it it at

651
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,399
least allows growers to manage the

652
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:07,038
environment more than they have to be

653
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,919
worried about the plant itself. M so

654
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:13,519
we're we're hoping that some of this

655
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:15,278
microbiome eliminates causes for concern

656
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,359
uh even though you've got such sensitive

657
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,440
data that that you know you've got eight

658
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,319
or 10 cells of one microbe and it may

659
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,759
show up as a as a positive. Yeah. No,

660
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,439
and that's interesting you you mentioned

661
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,158
aspiggillis because one of the arguments

662
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,320
against doing aspiggilis testing is that

663
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,159
it's ubiquitous. It's everywhere. You

664
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,879
can't possibly be growing without it.

665
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,760
So, it's interesting to find uh for you

666
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,760
to not find it, I suppose. Yeah. I mean,

667
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,839
at the early stages anyway, of of plant

668
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,679
growth, it may establish itself later

669
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,720
on, but it's it's definitely not one of

670
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,360
the the high numbers. The ones that that

671
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,440
I see uh that we may end up spending

672
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,359
more time looking at is fuserium because

673
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,200
we are seeing fusarium early on all the

674
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,959
way through the plant and in some cases

675
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,000
getting into the flowers and we know

676
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,278
that happens the flower infections and

677
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,038
those species also produce various

678
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:08,240
micotoxins and so we know that one uh

679
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,720
can originate from in inside the plant

680
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,319
and to me that may be more concern in

681
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,400
the in the long term than perhaps

682
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:18,879
aspiggillis that that could be external

683
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,640
source of of inoculum.

684
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Yeah, that is definitely interesting

685
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,799
because I know fuserium is is a problem

686
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,840
and a concern and you know we've

687
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:30,798
developed qPCR testing to try to screen

688
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,000
plants for it. Um which is why it's sort

689
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,519
of interesting that if it's so

690
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,798
ubiquitous perhaps there needs to be

691
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:40,000
some sort of cut off or um threshold

692
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,000
where um it's more of a concern but that

693
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
would take

694
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,278
that's the next the next step I mean we

695
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,278
don't want to add any more regulations

696
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,038
but I think what we want to do is make

697
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,038
sure that the regulations that are we

698
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:54,158
are using make make sense like make

699
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,839
biological sense um I know aspigillos is

700
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,159
up there because historically it's had

701
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:01,119
some some major issues on human health

702
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,278
But if it's not as prevalent or not

703
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,119
embedded in the plant and it's coming

704
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,839
from outside and perhaps not as much

705
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,319
concern, then maybe we need to reassess

706
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,599
uh what the important microbes are.

707
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,839
Yeah, absolutely. And now and I know too

708
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,558
that you've analyzed different tissue

709
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,278
types from roots to leaves to flowers,

710
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,200
stems. Um what are some of the insights

711
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,519
there from looking at the different

712
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,519
tissue types? Yeah. So there's there's a

713
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,278
fair amount of variation there and and

714
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,558
similar work has been done with hemp.

715
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,919
There's been a couple of papers that

716
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,359
have shown that there are tissue

717
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,360
specific groups of microbes. What that

718
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,519
means is that you might find one type

719
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,359
more more prevalent in the roots and

720
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,918
another type more common in the leaves

721
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,479
and so on. Uh definitely the roots have

722
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,520
the most. Mhm. Uh I would say the next

723
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,880
tissue that has high levels are stems

724
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,240
which kind of makes sense because that's

725
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,559
where the you know the transport is

726
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,720
occurring. and then uh less so in the

727
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,678
leaves. The leaves seem to have fewer of

728
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,440
these these endoyes and other microbes.

729
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,000
And we're only now in the process of

730
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,440
analyzing the flowers which is the the

731
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,440
you know the critical phase of the

732
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,960
analysis. But we have to be a little

733
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,360
careful with flowers because as I

734
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,120
mentioned there's a lot of external uh

735
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,599
introduction of these microbes from the

736
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:18,398
air from from water from whatever else.

737
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,038
So when we do the microbiome analysis of

738
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,918
flowers it's not showing only what's

739
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:26,720
internalized. they could be external um

740
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:30,200
things that that come into play for that

741
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,200
for that analysis.

742
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:37,918
So in terms of giving growers some

743
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,440
actionable items from your research like

744
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,520
what what I know we kind of touched on

745
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,320
some things about um you know using

746
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,000
tricoderma or beneficial microbes but in

747
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,119
addition to that what other sort of

748
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,278
advice could you give based on uh your

749
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,119
findings here? Yeah. So, I think you

750
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:54,720
know if growers have have some favorite

751
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,398
genetics, genetics that they've been

752
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,798
hanging on to that they really want to

753
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,798
keep going, it would be a not a bad idea

754
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,839
to test the microbiome of that

755
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,359
particular plant or series of plants.

756
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,918
you know, you can you can collect root

757
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,639
tissues or you can collect stem tissues

758
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,320
and send it off for for analysis and

759
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,960
it'll give it'll give them an idea of

760
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,319
what sort of the background um microbes

761
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,399
that are already established in the

762
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,079
mothers because we know that a good

763
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,079
proportion of that are going to move on

764
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,599
to the cutings and and then so on and so

765
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:27,839
forth. So, uh you know and it may also

766
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,519
reveal what other pathogens could be

767
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:33,038
could be present that they had no idea

768
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:35,440
were there. So um definitely for

769
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:37,440
favorite genetics uh that that are being

770
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,000
stored for a long time, go ahead and do

771
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,798
a microbiome analysis on it and see see

772
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,079
what you got. Um following that cutings

773
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,000
made from those plants, I would

774
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,720
definitely suggest they they be rooted

775
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,960
in a medium that has beneficials in it.

776
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,278
Um can't go into details about which

777
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,278
ones. Some growers have preferences over

778
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,759
what they consider beneficial.

779
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,278
Definitely have those on early. they,

780
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,879
you know, some growers tend to put it on

781
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:02,880
later when the plants are rooted and

782
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,600
they're getting ready to go into flower.

783
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,320
I would say put it on much earlier, um,

784
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,000
and get those established. Now, one, one

785
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,480
fungal organism that we didn't touch

786
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,119
upon is the is the microisy. The

787
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,360
microisy being those we know they're all

788
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,359
pretty much beneficial fungi. I was

789
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,079
surprised that there are mic there is

790
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,879
microisy present already in some of

791
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:27,439
these plants cannabis plants that that

792
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,679
um seem to have a favorable relationship

793
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,679
with the microisy and we're finding it

794
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,759
in the in the in the in the roots where

795
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,159
you'd expect. We're finding it in the

796
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,398
stems which we didn't expect and we're

797
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,880
even finding it higher up in the plant.

798
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,839
So it almost suggests these microisy may

799
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,600
be carried along uh you know through the

800
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,918
successive development of that plant

801
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,839
which to me was a surprise because we

802
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,919
always think of it just in the roots

803
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,000
like it's just there and that's

804
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,360
definitely a beneficial that that needs

805
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,159
to be looked at. Excellent. No and it's

806
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:03,199
great advice to kind of get your

807
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,960
microbiome an analyzed. Um, and not to

808
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,600
put you too much on the spot here, but

809
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,960
if someone were to do that and looked at

810
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,959
their report, are there any certain

811
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,360
microbes that would sort of be a red

812
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,120
flag um that they they potentially have

813
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,079
an issue and how would they go about

814
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,439
remedying something like that? Yeah. So,

815
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,278
you know, there's always surprises when

816
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,240
you get down to that level of analysis.

817
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,440
It's it's always uh concerning. Now, one

818
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,440
thing that I didn't mention that

819
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,200
probably is worth mentioning is that uh

820
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,159
when you do get the microbiome results

821
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,480
back, it also reflects um cells that may

822
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,679
be dead. In other words, the microbe may

823
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,440
have been there, but it's not there

824
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,240
anymore. So, you're getting a total

825
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,798
analysis of in the past and and the

826
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,558
present in terms of what could be there.

827
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:51,759
Um I mean we we haven't seen any super

828
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:54,398
surprising results um visav something

829
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,158
new and exotic that hasn't been reported

830
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,158
before in North America or some other

831
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,640
really bizarre. We're finding what we

832
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,200
would expect are microbes that grow in

833
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,038
substrates that are microbes that are in

834
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,558
in the um in the environment. Um it was

835
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,720
really interesting because the one of

836
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,960
the the hits we call it a hits meaning a

837
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,759
match. One of the matches we found in in

838
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,840
these samples was human DNA. I'm

839
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,038
thinking, okay, there's human DNA. Well,

840
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:20,959
it makes sense because people are

841
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,319
touching the plants. They're they're

842
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,399
watering them. They're doing things to

843
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,398
the flowers. So, some of our our skin

844
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,959
cells come off, right? And they they

845
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:31,359
land on the tissue. And sometimes they

846
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,600
can be mixed up with with the DNA that

847
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,918
we extract from the plant. So, there's

848
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,359
some some human DNA, which I mean,

849
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,759
somebody may freak out and think, what's

850
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,519
that doing there? It's not surprising.

851
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,879
So it's it's sensitive enough that you

852
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:48,319
know some cells from from human hair or

853
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,799
or skin cells could be it could show up

854
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:53,599
in the

855
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:55,839
analysis. Interesting. Um so looking

856
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,599
forward I know that you said that we're

857
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,240
still very early on in terms of looking

858
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:03,359
at the microbiome for cannabis and hemp.

859
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,720
So um what what are some questions that

860
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,479
you have that you're looking to answer

861
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,320
in the coming years?

862
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,398
So for sure we we need to find out what

863
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,559
the what a good balance of microbes is.

864
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,159
In other words, you know, you've got a I

865
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,199
I don't just throw a number out. We have

866
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,440
maybe let's say 50 50 different species

867
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,678
that are present in uh in a cannabis

868
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,800
plant. We need to narrow that down to

869
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,639
maybe the the optimal four or five that

870
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,079
we think are are always there that

871
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,960
they're serving a good purpose. One

872
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,879
being the penicellium, maybe the

873
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,559
microisy and then see if we can enhance

874
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,039
those. you know, in other words, favor

875
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,599
the the the plant so that it's going in

876
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,119
a in a different

877
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,359
direction. Um the interesting thing that

878
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:47,358
there was a report out of Europe just

879
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:50,559
last year. They compared um cannabis or

880
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:53,199
or hemp varieties that had been heavily

881
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,679
selected or bred over time versus some

882
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:58,319
that were more or less wild or hadn't

883
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,680
been successively bred over the years.

884
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,680
And they looked at the microbiome

885
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,039
differences between those two. And what

886
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,000
they found was that in the ones that

887
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:09,679
were heavily bred, uh, the microbiome

888
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,159
um, variability was way lower than what

889
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:14,480
you'd find in the natural plants or the

890
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,319
so-called the land races. So, one of the

891
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,440
things that's that's happening as we

892
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,599
evolve with more and more sophisticated

893
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,480
cannabis or hemp varieties is that we're

894
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,838
altering the microbiome

895
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,920
composition without even realizing we're

896
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,279
doing that. So, if we knew what some of

897
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,440
these beneficials were, we would

898
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,839
definitely want to add those back. to

899
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,240
that subset population that's being used

900
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:39,078
for breeding purposes to make sure that

901
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,039
that they have, you know, the necessary

902
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,760
background. The other thing I found

903
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,119
interesting was that seeds, there's a

904
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,480
there's a fair component of the

905
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,240
microbiome that ends up in the seed. Um,

906
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,400
and obviously that's carried over to the

907
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,358
next generation. And that to me is also

908
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,000
pretty fascinating. Can we modify the

909
00:35:54,358 --> 00:36:01,039
seed microbiome early on to alter its

910
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,239
its characteristics so that maybe um you

911
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:06,880
know it it begins to it begins to show

912
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,799
favorable factors. Now one quick mention

913
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,280
of course is that we know from the

914
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,640
scanning microscopy uh studies we did

915
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,680
where we can look inside the plants

916
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,440
themselves. The reason they're in the

917
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,879
seed is because we pretty sure now

918
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,880
they're traveling through the vascular

919
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,800
system. They're getting into the xyllem

920
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,880
and finding their way into the seed. You

921
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,480
know, if this is a seed plant and and

922
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,838
finding their way inside the seed that

923
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,159
way. Wow. Oh, so we're going to see some

924
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:34,159
more great images

925
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,279
probably. I I haven't looked at the

926
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,799
seeds myself yet, but I'll bet you that

927
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,400
um there's there's definitely things in

928
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,240
there. But I can show you some really

929
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,760
nice images of the what we call the

930
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,598
plumbing system of the plant, which is

931
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,760
the xyllem. And you can actually find

932
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,440
these spores embedded. Wow. All

933
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,839
different kinds of spores in there that

934
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,400
nobody has ever seen before. It's a

935
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,880
visual confirmation that the microbes

936
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,440
the the microbiome is shifting moving up

937
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,880
the plant. Wow, that's really cool. This

938
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,200
video might break a million when you

939
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,039
have that. Well, let's see. I don't

940
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,639
think anything beats the tricoms, man.

941
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,400
Really, that stuff that stuff's the

942
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,719
best. The tricoms are are the I mean,

943
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,760
this is pretty cool, too. But the tricom

944
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:16,078
photos, uh, it still just blows me away.

945
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,440
Awesome. Yeah. And it's good you

946
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,359
mentioned seed because I had a question

947
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,119
earlier and we kind of had moved on but

948
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,559
when you were talking about how when you

949
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,599
take the cutings from the mother plant

950
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:29,599
and sort of introduce it the microbiome

951
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,680
sort of establish so um the substrate

952
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,599
microbiome it's not going to have as

953
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:37,838
much of an impact. Is the same true for

954
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,838
seed or um when you place a seed into a

955
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,239
growing medium is there more of a chance

956
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,320
that it could influence it? Yeah, that

957
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,000
that's a good I I would say that a seed

958
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,920
that's just starting to grow and putting

959
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,838
out a small root would be more

960
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,680
influenced by by the microbiome. In

961
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,000
other words, you can have positive and

962
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,078
negative effects at that young very

963
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,159
young stage because it's not as well

964
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,160
established as a cutting. the cutting

965
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,480
is, you know, 100 times larger and it's

966
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:05,879
it's got its own microbiome, but the

967
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,358
seed um could be influenced by by

968
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,960
external factors in the in the substrate

969
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,519
that would definitely make it make it

970
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,358
important. Excellent. Excellent. Okay,

971
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,358
Zamir, winding down here. Before I let

972
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:20,159
you go, I want to give you a chance uh

973
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:22,960
to share with the listeners or viewers

974
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,639
um any other resources on this topic

975
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,199
that you think might be useful. be happy

976
