00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:19,839
I think most cannabis consumers by now

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,439
are familiar with turpins and sort of

4
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,920
the role that they play in uh the

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,000
experience the smells and you know even

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,000
the actual experience of consuming but

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,960
as you point out in the paper that tpin

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,238
are only telling a a small portion of

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,799
the overall story and that sort of some

10
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:40,558
of these attempts to classify cultivars

11
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,078
by their top Tarpin um weren't really

12
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,558
working so speak a little bit to that

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,960
yeah so I mean if you look within the

14
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:49,640
study we we were trying to measure a

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,480
broad variety of exotic cannabis

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,600
cultivars everything from as sweet and

17
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,519
fruity as possible get something that is

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,120
dark berry something has tropical notes

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,920
something that has weird Citrus notes

20
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,358
like Tangi but also prototypical

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,320
and you can look at some of the Exotics

22
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,478
and some may be tropical and others may

23
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,438
be dark berry and they have a lot of

24
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,879
either lemon or one of these major three

25
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,478
turpins but they don't smell the same

26
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,839
and when you go to the Savory front like

27
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,519
GMO and other Savory Exotics they also

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,799
have similar top turpins but their

29
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,719
overall Aromas aren't anything close now

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,479
that doesn't mean that the the tpin

31
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,719
don't impart any flavoring r at all in

32
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:32,438
it wasn't part of the research

33
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,959
publication itself but we did some

34
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:35,158
studies in our lab just to see well what

35
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,719
would happen if we stripped all the

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,719
turpins out and did just everything else

37
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,519
right what's this going to smell and

38
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,959
taste like pretty weird um straight up

39
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,959
it didn't didn't smell and taste like

40
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,239
cannabis was unbalanced it had a very

41
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,438
weird non-descript experience that was

42
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,359
just very just unpleasant it's not until

43
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,758
you have everything there that it has

44
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,840
all the balance of what the plant

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,399
intended right you have all the

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,960
everything basically in Sy and working

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,718
just harmoniously together to give it

48
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,879
this full experience because if you

49
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,719
strip out that core base of what makes

50
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,239
cannabis unique and even though it's

51
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,479
like even though lemoning may not

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,878
correlate to Exotic specific nature it

53
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,759
doesn't mean it has no impact to the the

54
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,840
flavor and Aroma of cannabis that we all

55
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,280
know and appreciate um and so having it

56
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,640
all there is super important but it's

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,159
not the defining features of what makes

58
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,359
exotic it's a it's required to give it

59
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,479
that full experience but it doesn't help

60
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,080
to find that exotic note a lot of that

61
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,639
coming from those Esters these other new

62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,319
compounds we discovered in this specific

63
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:45,359
study right so it's almost like music

64
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:48,919
where you know maybe your terapin are

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,760
your drum kit and your guitar and your

66
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,919
bass guitar but it's really sort of the

67
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,158
you know synthesizers or the other sort

68
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,238
of instruments that you're layering in

69
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:03,239
on top of that that makes it sort of a

70
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,878
unique musical composition 100 per. it's

71
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,759
it's exactly how we started to explain

72
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,318
to a lot of the customers and our sales

73
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,519
team we've been working with when we try

74
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,119
and bring this complex chemistry and

75
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,200
bring it to it layers down the way to

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,080
explain it is just like that right if

77
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,798
you have a symphony and you strip out

78
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,719
your string quartets your strings or

79
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,799
your brass you're still G to have music

80
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:29,359
but is it the same no right it maybe not

81
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,438
like tping they are absolutely needed

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,120
but they're not that the most only thing

83
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:36,719
representative of all Roma right that

84
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,920
would be that's where again the study

85
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,280
came in to show that hey Turin yes they

86
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,158
have importance and value but there's

87
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,360
more we haven't been considering as an

88
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:48,318
industry that play a significant role

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
that we should start looking

90
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,389
