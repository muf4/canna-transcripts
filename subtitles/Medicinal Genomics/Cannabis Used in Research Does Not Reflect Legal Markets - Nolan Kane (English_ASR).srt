1
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:10,509
thank you very much the organizers for

2
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:15,788
inviting me to all of you for listening

3
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:20,439
so I'm I'm a plant geneticist and like

4
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:24,429
John I find this plant really exciting

5
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:27,519
it's it's interesting to me to come here

6
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:28,719
I think this is a great group of people

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,839
with different interests different

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:35,619
skills different backgrounds and some

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:38,189
some of you and the audience are really

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:40,358
helping to build a solid foundation of

11
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,549
our understanding of how this plant

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:44,649
affects us starting with one enzyme I

13
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:46,689
mean sorry starting starting one

14
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:49,870
cannabinoid or maybe one terpene at a

15
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:53,619
time and and understanding how that

16
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:56,228
works with our own cb1 and cb2 receptors

17
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:58,538
and other aspects of our physiology to

18
00:00:56,228 --> 00:01:00,399
create an effect other people are

19
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:03,489
starting with the plant side of things

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,739
and taking the whole messiness and

21
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:08,170
complexity that's in the plant material

22
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:10,569
or parts of that and seeing how that

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,290
affects people and using that as a

24
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:17,229
treatment and I think it's I think I

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,700
before I really get into what I the main

26
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:23,020
message that I want to say I think it's

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,150
really important to think think about

28
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:30,489
things starting from both directions I

29
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:33,790
think we know that the plant has a lot

30
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:38,319
of important effects on a lot of

31
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:43,300
different key traits key key pathways in

32
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:45,429
our own bodies but we don't really

33
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,989
understand how it works because of the

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,380
complexity of all of the different

35
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:55,329
terpenes and cannabinoids that that we

36
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:58,329
just heard about actually and on the

37
00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:02,170
other side we know that there we know

38
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:04,650
the effects of some key molecules but if

39
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,450
it was as simple as one molecule

40
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,030
creating a lot of these effects Marinol

41
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,250
would be success and almost nobody uses

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,348
marinol right because it doesn't have

43
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,579
some of the same properties of the plant

44
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:18,280
material and we don't really understand

45
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:22,689
why so keep that in mind as

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,959
as I'm talking so um so just thinking

47
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:27,759
about how I got here when I started as a

48
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,959
professor a few years ago in Colorado a

49
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:35,318
lot of changes a lot of changes were

50
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,719
happening on the legal side and just as

51
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:39,458
we as we all know a lot of different

52
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,689
states are starting to experiment with

53
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:50,349
this and creating these state legal

54
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:55,090
markets where we can start to see what

55
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:56,409
people are going to basically we're

56
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,509
starting to see the effects of some of

57
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:01,150
these state markets and people are

58
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:03,639
starting to do some some science but the

59
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,969
science that's being done now really

60
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:09,909
dates back a lot you know cannabis

61
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:12,189
science is there's some there's mentions

62
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:16,269
of cannabis in the oldest medical texts

63
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:17,650
in both Asia and Europe so it's

64
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:19,480
something that's been recognized for a

65
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,280
long time that there's something

66
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,009
important about this plant and yet we

67
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,000
still don't really understand very much

68
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:30,819
how that's working and that's despite

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,259
really a lot of great work by people but

70
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,379
it's it's a complicated it's a

71
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:39,009
complicated system and today in the u.s.

72
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:41,379
anyway most of the science that's being

73
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,870
done on the real clinical side of things

74
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:46,030
has to go through the National Institute

75
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,400
on Drug Abuse which is the sole legal

76
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,530
provider of candidate of most kinds of

77
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,549
cannabis products for medical research

78
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,979
in the US so in nineteen sixty-eight

79
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,140
there's one source in Mississippi has

80
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:01,179
been really the where we're all

81
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:05,589
marijuana products for most kinds of

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:08,439
studies on human physiological or animal

83
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,750
effects are coming from really this one

84
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,269
source and most published studies used a

85
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,129
very limited pool of cannabis diversity

86
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,579
with only two or three percent THC

87
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:20,909
anyway very low levels of THC and also

88
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:25,810
very low levels of any other cannabinoid

89
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,180
also very anecdotally anyway very little

90
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:32,290
in the way of terpenes or other key

91
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:36,939
plant compounds NIDA is recognized

92
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:39,400
finally that this is maybe an issue and

93
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:41,500
they've been trying to increase some of

94
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,769
the THC levels and other cannabinoid

95
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:49,360
levels and diversity however I think

96
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:52,500
it's what I wanted to do as as part of

97
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,400
this is the thing about how how relevant

98
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,639
or how I guess

99
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,379
well how I'm how what's available from

100
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,360
NIDA compares to what's available in the

101
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:02,620
state markets and how relevant is that

102
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,360
we're happy when we try to compare

103
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,449
what's in these medical studies to what

104
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,710
people are saying anecdotally how do we

105
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:13,000
how do we make that connection and just

106
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:14,079
just to put things in perspective I

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,750
thought I'd look at how many different

108
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,089
papers talked about medical health

109
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,579
effects and the National Institute on

110
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:24,250
Drug Abuse suit derived some of their

111
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:27,039
findings either directly or indirectly

112
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,910
from information derived from these

113
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,490
strains and we're talking about

114
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,710
thousands of papers every year are at

115
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,360
least mentioning marijuana health

116
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:36,039
effects a National Institute on Drug

117
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,020
Abuse it's not necessarily definitive

118
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,140
but I'm just pointing out a lot of a lot

119
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:42,849
of people are using information derived

120
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:46,829
from this work to make some kinds of

121
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:50,560
claims scientific claims and mostly

122
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:53,709
mostly this this is focused on mostly

123
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,389
the THC and now CBD a little bit of work

124
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:59,859
on CB G and CBN but you know these are

125
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:03,550
basically the decarboxylated breakdown

126
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,500
products if some of the some of the and

127
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,879
they're more typically thought to be

128
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,490
more bioactive than the things that are

129
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,920
in the plant but basically a limited

130
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,910
number of cannabinoids people are

131
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,400
talking about we know something about

132
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,750
the genetics of you know if you have a

133
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,000
hemp strain you might have some

134
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,709
variation and how much CBD is there but

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,670
typically most of the cannabinoids are

136
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:26,680
going to be CBD very little THC whereas

137
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,140
marijuana strains are you be mostly THC

138
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,939
very little

139
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:37,539
CBD and and if you cross them you get a

140
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:39,329
whole mixture of different genetics so

141
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,090
each of these dots is a different

142
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:46,009
genetic variety that they have in this

143
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:49,000
in this case in these cases have

144
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:51,019
have you no novel cannabinoid profiles

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,370
different than either their parents and

146
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:58,099
that's really the basis of a lot of

147
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:59,389
modern cannabis breeding but really most

148
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,600
of the most of the work that's being

149
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:05,120
done is only looking at a very limited

150
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,439
part of the diversity of cannabinoids so

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,970
this is just this is just looking at

152
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,329
that it's tiny

153
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,820
these are all different cannabinoids

154
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:15,589
you'd find in the plant these are these

155
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,870
are you know just a small section of the

156
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:20,060
diversity and this is their biosynthesis

157
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,610
and then these are these are some

158
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,160
different breakdown products that that

159
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,629
can happen and you can see these are

160
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,550
these are some different terpenes and

161
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,949
you can see that they're derived from

162
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,240
some of the same precursors so related

163
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:38,449
biosynthetic pathways but but but this

164
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,759
is just a tiny portion of the of the of

165
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:43,430
the the chemical diversity that's in the

166
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,110
plant that's really being looked at but

167
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,689
but there's a reason for that of course

168
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,770
it's that these are some of the major

169
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,019
cannabinoids in there

170
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:54,919
I just want to mention some great work

171
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:57,709
that Ryan Lynch I did when he's in my

172
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,740
lab now he said this little genomics

173
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:02,029
doing great work there but basically

174
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,889
what I want you to get out of this

175
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,859
complicated slide is that there's some

176
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:10,819
genetic lineages this is based on genome

177
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,439
sequencing of a large number a large

178
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,060
proportion of the diversity of course

179
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,219
there's always more that you could wish

180
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,100
for to be included but we were able to

181
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,870
pull out hemp lineages as being distinct

182
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,790
from broadleaf drug types and narrow

183
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:27,439
leaf drug types are the things that have

184
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,970
a lot of THC in them and and then a lot

185
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,100
of things that are hybrids mixtures of

186
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,690
different genetic components so this is

187
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,740
just a this is called a genetic Network

188
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:39,800
showing some of the connections

189
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,049
representing the the major major genetic

190
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,819
lineages what really I want to get at is

191
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,289
that there are some in this case we were

192
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,140
able to identify three different genetic

193
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:49,699
lineages that were we're pretty clear

194
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:53,330
and if we look at the chemical diversity

195
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:56,629
we can see they differed CBD and THC a

196
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:59,300
right so there's some differences

197
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:59,840
between broadleaf and narrow leaf but

198
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,759
also

199
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,710
bigger differences between either of

200
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,169
them and and half in terms of how much

201
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,200
THC course hemp has very low THC and

202
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:10,789
much higher CBD this is just limited

203
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,420
sample of diversity but still I think

204
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:15,889
tells a somewhat of a clear story and if

205
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:19,669
we look at the more minor cannabinoids

206
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:22,819
we can see that those same three

207
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:24,289
lineages differ in some of so the

208
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,360
precursor molecule is just basically

209
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:27,439
very a lot how much is in the plant

210
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,360
material that's going to basically

211
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,660
depend more on the when you harvest it

212
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,850
and and how you grow it rather than any

213
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:37,399
genetic differences some of these

214
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,320
different minor cannabinoids actually do

215
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,509
differ at least in our sample differed

216
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,650
between the the major genetic lineages

217
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:47,990
and others didn't that's basically where

218
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:51,049
I'm going to where I'm going to leave it

219
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,639
at that is that there's there's a

220
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:55,549
there's there could be some key

221
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,710
diversity differences in some of the

222
00:09:55,549 --> 00:10:00,379
more minor cannabinoids similarly with

223
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,389
the some of the terpenes again there's

224
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:04,279
some things that vary a lot within the

225
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:06,379
different lineages and are not

226
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,579
significant so the same letter means

227
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:09,500
they're not significantly different

228
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,050
the biggest difference at least in our

229
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,269
sample and the terpenes was was in

230
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:16,309
Mersin and several others have suggested

231
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,220
that might cause some of the differences

232
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:21,289
between some of the major genetic

233
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,250
lineages in terms of some of their their

234
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:27,289
effects could be due to mersin but noes

235
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,450
and I want to keep that just keep that

236
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:30,049
in mind that these terpenes and

237
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,390
terpenoids

238
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:33,709
they're mainly responsible for the odor

239
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:35,569
and flavor they have antimicrobial

240
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:38,000
properties some of them are already

241
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:41,900
known to interact with the cb1 or cb2

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,090
receptors and also do seem to interact

243
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:48,169
with the cannabinoids based on some

244
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:49,610
limited evidence to lead to alterations

245
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:51,620
in the psychological effect and the

246
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,450
science behind that is pretty limited

247
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,659
there's there's some but it's limited

248
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:59,000
but the main the main thing is if you go

249
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:01,100
in a dispensary you'll find a lot of

250
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,159
different strains that have very similar

251
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:07,070
levels of THC and yet have dramatic

252
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:10,219
differences in their effects and so it's

253
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,170
not just about THC it's about something

254
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,430
related to some of these other compounds

255
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:15,620
in their very

256
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:19,639
well might be some of these terpenes as

257
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,570
as it turns out but I wanted to compare

258
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,519
okay

259
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,970
so there's all this diversity out there

260
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:28,689
what kind of diversity is available for

261
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,970
federally legal research at universities

262
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:35,720
and how how does not a compare to what's

263
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,310
in the state markets and just to just to

264
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,920
show a few of the cannabinoids if we

265
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:42,739
look at CBD and I had to we had to

266
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,179
calculate CBD levels because the federal

267
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,820
government only releases CBD they don't

268
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:51,909
break it down at the CBD verses CBD a or

269
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:54,110
THC versus C THC a because they use GC

270
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:57,100
technology to measure their cannabinoids

271
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,419
and so what they report doesn't include

272
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,839
does include that information so we had

273
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:06,799
to we had to convert our values to

274
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,660
equivalent decarboxylated versions just

275
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,479
for those of you who care about that I

276
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:14,419
didn't I did I know there should be an a

277
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,639
after it but in this case the data we

278
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:18,379
have is on CBD from the federal

279
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,659
government and if we compare what what

280
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:24,708
what what's available you can see they

281
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:26,778
actually do a pretty good job for CBD in

282
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:29,239
terms of the range of different values

283
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:31,458
so each of these is represents a

284
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,830
different night of strain and their

285
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,149
reported levels of CBD and you can see

286
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,850
there's a fair amount of diversity on

287
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,629
average their CBD lines are lower in CBD

288
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,149
than what you'd get in state markets but

289
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:47,120
at least the range of diversity is there

290
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:49,639
if you look at THC levels you can see

291
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,700
it's much lower than anything that would

292
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,220
ever be sold by a reputable dispensary

293
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,370
anymore it's about a quarter as much as

294
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,129
you'd ever get in a in a dispensary in

295
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,078
most of the cases except for course it's

296
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:07,039
more similar to the THC levels in like

297
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:09,588
one to one or variable you know lines

298
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,028
that have a mixture of THC and CBD in

299
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,250
some of these dispensaries but on

300
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:15,379
average you know five to ten percent is

301
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:20,299
on the high end for what NIDA makes

302
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:22,009
available for research CBG is is not

303
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:27,328
that different between the federal and

304
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:29,278
federal materials and the

305
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:32,998
markets for at least the lines that have

306
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,458
CBG but they don't have anything that

307
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:42,600
they listed that has substantial THC V

308
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:45,268
which is a potentially a quite

309
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,739
interesting other cannabinoid but not

310
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:50,129
present in any of the nanomaterial

311
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:51,569
according their results and this is so

312
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,610
that's sort of the averages what about

313
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:55,198
the another of you another way of

314
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,220
looking at the diversities for lines I

315
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:01,919
have both CBD and THC in them at more

316
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,678
than one percent so so taking out the

317
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,238
lines that are just pure CBD or mainly

318
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,818
CBD or mainly th see what kind of

319
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:10,920
diversity does night I offer of things

320
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:14,368
that have more than that and you can see

321
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,988
it's only only a only low levels of

322
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:19,170
total cannabinoids and also only a

323
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:22,860
subset of the range of variation in CBD

324
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:25,169
to THC ratio is available in the lines

325
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,149
that they have listed compared to the

326
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:30,838
broader diversity available in the state

327
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:33,119
markets so um it's not necessarily

328
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,639
totally irrelevant but it only it only

329
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:39,749
tells us a part of the story of why

330
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:42,568
people are using cannabis products at

331
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:44,189
the in the state markets and also the

332
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:46,918
potential range of effects of those

333
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:49,469
cannabis products both good and bad it's

334
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:53,909
not is not able to be studied using this

335
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,048
kind of material if we if we go broader

336
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:56,909
and look at all of the total

337
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:58,828
cannabinoids it's basically the same

338
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:01,139
kind of story so basically this is

339
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:02,878
taking a whole broad range of

340
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:07,110
cannabinoids distilling it statistically

341
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:09,119
down into only two axes principal

342
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,579
component one principal component two

343
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:14,579
and what that does is this just tells

344
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,498
you it helps us visualize the diversity

345
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,628
of the chemical to the phytochemical

346
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:20,850
diversity available in some of these

347
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:22,139
different markets so just comparing

348
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,360
Oakland Sacramento and nighted we can

349
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,339
see that NIDA again only has a tiny

350
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,558
range of variation compared to what's

351
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,139
available in the state markets and these

352
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:33,629
are and you could see also a lot of the

353
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,209
state markets have have also these

354
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:38,688
outliers that are even more unusual

355
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:41,519
plant material whereas the night of

356
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:43,439
material has very little and

357
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,509
way of these extreme outliers and really

358
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,120
only covers a very small range of the

359
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:50,429
total total diversity the phytochemical

360
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,000
diversity that's present in the state

361
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:55,739
markets so just just to think about that

362
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,519
a little bit more you know we've we've

363
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,870
heard today about the effects of you

364
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,250
know individual cannabinoids or

365
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:07,409
groupings of cannabinoids and turf

366
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,879
beings and a lot of some of that is is

367
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:17,539
certainly done at the university level

368
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:20,309
but but a lot of what we hear about is I

369
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:23,759
guess a lot of I guess a lot of what you

370
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:25,169
read about in in the in the papers is is

371
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,149
going to be limited because NIDA

372
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:29,849
has very different levels of

373
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:32,100
cannabinoids they have roughly a quarter

374
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,860
of the THC levels in their teach see

375
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,690
lines they typically have lower CBD

376
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,389
levels then when you get a state market

377
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:43,230
but I would argue that it's not as

378
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:47,340
Extreme as the THC situation essentially

379
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:49,350
no measure - no measurable see HCV CBC

380
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,370
or other what we call what some people

381
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:55,259
term minor cannabinoids I should also

382
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:59,129
point out that they don't even report

383
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:03,149
terpene levels for their material that

384
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:06,720
they send out and so you can't request

385
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:11,849
material easily at least to have a

386
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,900
particular terpene content I think the

387
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,659
research using NIDA

388
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,769
marijuana is limited in terms of what

389
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:23,450
kind of terpene diversity is there there

390
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:27,509
are some things that I haven't shown you

391
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:29,190
from NIDA there are some can I have an

392
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:33,420
always that actually higher in NIDA

393
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:40,200
so what actually one in particular NIDA

394
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:46,830
has 11 to 23 times the cbn content so

395
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:50,910
what does that tell you yes oh oh bold

396
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:54,029
well it's also old so CBN is a natural

397
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,259
breakdown product of Delta 9 THC due to

398
00:17:54,029 --> 00:18:00,928
oxidation or UV

399
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:05,190
other other other processes occur over

400
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:08,240
time leading to CBN to breakdown so one

401
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,380
possible explanation using nidus

402
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,808
information or not his website that I

403
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,549
got just a few days ago they say the

404
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,899
university designates a secure plot of

405
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:17,639
land where marijuana crops are grown

406
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,309
every few years based on current and

407
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,929
expected demand the manner marijuana has

408
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,339
grown harvested stored and made

409
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:25,259
available as bulk marijuana or other

410
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,689
purified elements of marijuana to use

411
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:32,490
for research every few years

412
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:34,470
ok maybe that explains why it has ten to

413
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,120
twenty eleven to twenty three times as

414
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,940
much of the breakdown products of

415
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:43,439
cannabinoids as anything you'd ever see

416
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,720
in a dispensary and it's not this is not

417
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,080
an essay this is not necessarily an

418
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,548
innocuous issue because we know all of

419
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,289
these cannabinoids are interacting with

420
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:59,009
each other to create the physiological

421
00:18:52,289 --> 00:19:03,440
effects and the fact that the research

422
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:06,119
grade materials are so heavily degraded

423
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,950
that they don't have substantial

424
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,649
terpenes and have much higher rates of

425
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:14,279
the breakdown products limits our

426
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,750
ability to really really understand what

427
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,720
what's happening when people are using

428
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:22,400
very different material in the state

429
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:26,100
market so I would argue that you know

430
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,290
this issue NIDA having lower levels of

431
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:33,119
most cannabinoids a lower diversity of

432
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:37,259
cannabinoids and higher levels of the

433
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:39,750
breakdown products of THC CBD suggests I

434
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,519
would argue that's a major issue when

435
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,279
we're trying to understand the effects

436
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,918
of the marijuana that people are using

437
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,279
in the state markets and I would

438
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,940
advocate that something needs to change

439
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:55,470
such that ongoing and future research

440
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,110
can be improved in terms of its

441
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,730
relevance we need we need materials with

442
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:02,459
higher diversity of cannabinoids higher

443
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,048
levels of relevant products lower levels

444
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,579
of degradation products unless you're

445
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:09,148
interested specifically in studying

446
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:11,368
those degradation products and also

447
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:15,138
making sure that we have relevant levels

448
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:20,278
of the the key terpenes and terpenoids

449
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:22,738
compounds just to briefly thank people

450
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:25,700
before my time totally runs out daniela

451
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:28,139
Vergara constructed the bulk of the

452
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,200
statistical analysis along with student

453
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:33,269
Bidwell and my collaborator in the

454
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,450
psyche neuroscience department see you

455
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:37,528
ken hutchinson also the genetic analysis

456
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,598
that i mentioned in the beginning was

457
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:45,659
done by Ryan Lynch and funding from

458
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:47,338
several different sources and although

459
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:51,119
mainly mainly actually from from

460
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:53,608
donations and also I really should thank

461
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:55,439
steep hill for their expertise on the

462
00:20:53,608 --> 00:21:00,019
chemists chemical side of things and

463
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:03,838
their their help with understanding and

464
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:04,819
generating a lot of this data so thank

465
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:08,740
you very much

466
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:08,740
[Applause]

467
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:14,929
you
