1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,278
so I got a call from a lab in Florida

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,080
and they said that aspil terius was

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,759
showing up in all of their samples

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,440
including the negative control after

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,080
talking with them I learned that a

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,759
recent batch of R&amp;D samples had tested

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,839
positive for aspir gillus terius I

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,400
speculated that possibly the samples

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,399
were so hot that the aspergillus was

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:26,479
able to sporulate and contaminate the

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,879
entire lab cleaning up contamination in

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,960
a lab is no small task and so I flew

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,238
down the next day to in we wiped down

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,480
every surface with 10% bleach including

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,839
the floors pipets benches and any

16
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:41,479
equipment in the

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,520
room at one point I was on my hands and

18
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,479
knees scrubbing the floor when our sales

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,719
account manager walked in and he really

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,599
got a kick out of that after several

21
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,920
rounds of cleaning and running blank

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,760
samples to check if the mold was still

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,960
present we got a clean

24
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,960
result the lab thanked me for going

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,920
above and beyond but I was just doing my

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,920
job
