2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,439
to all of that I'm sure there are some

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,399
people watching or listening who aren't

4
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:23,640
familiar with CHS so can you give us a

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:27,879
rundown sure so this is a condition that

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,480
was first published in 2004 in Australia

7
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:32,719
um based on several cases Within index

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,480
case going back to

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,359
1996 now what's interesting is usually

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,718
when something's reported for the first

11
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:43,359
time you have a real evolution of the

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,719
description however they kneeled it

13
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,600
pretty much from the start so what they

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:53,079
were describing was a situation in which

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,800
uh chronic cannabis users uh developed a

16
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:59,719
syndrome in which they had nausea

17
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:02,558
vomiting abdominal pain often cyclic

18
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,280
that seemingly was relieved by hot water

19
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:07,959
bathing and some of the patients

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,079
involved would spend hours in the tub or

21
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:15,519
the shower um to try and relieve

22
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:18,719
symptoms um so uh this gradually has

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:22,478
become more frequent either

24
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,759
ascertainment has improved or uh what

25
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:28,200
many of us think is that has become more

26
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,200
prevalent over time with the greater

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,840
prevalence of H potency cannabis

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,439
materials and this seems mainly tied to

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:42,399
THC but we should point out that it's

30
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:45,959
really an issue with any CB1 canabo 1

31
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,478
receptor Agonist because the problem has

32
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,559
also been described in people who are

33
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:54,478
using some of the

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,600
synthetics uh the high potency synthetic

35
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:02,519
CB1 Agonist in total absence of cannabis

36
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:04,718
usage uh so clearly that's the problem

37
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,920
um there have been other people that

38
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,639
thought or would like to attribute this

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,479
to pesticide exposure but certainly

40
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:16,199
people get this even with organically

41
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:19,000
grown cannabis um and like it or not

42
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:22,399
cannabis is the culprit

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,439
here okay um so these bouts with

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,319
vomiting now as I understand it this

45
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,199
isn't just sort of like an acute

46
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:32,119
response where you know you kind of have

47
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:35,399
one episode it this is this is going on

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,120
for quite some time hours sometimes days

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,039
yeah that's an important distinction

50
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,519
anyone can get sick from Cannabis if

51
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:48,919
they have exposure all of a sudden to

52
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,680
too high a THC level so I I think many

53
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,598
people have had the experience of uh

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,120
using a vape for the first time or

55
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:59,518
having an edible that was too powerful

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,120
and actually getting sick so this is

57
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,080
part of part of the problem it's sort of

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,080
counterintuitive to people because

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,920
everybody knows that you use cannabis at

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,000
least in low dosages to treat nause and

61
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,839
vomiting associated with

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,439
chemotherapy so it doesn't make sense to

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,959
people that you can have

64
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,878
this reaction that seems illogical

65
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,360
however it's very consistent with what

66
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,840
we know about canono that they have

67
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,519
what's called a basic dose response

68
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,239
curve not a break that down it means

69
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,120
that a lot of the canabo will have one

70
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,280
activity at a low dose and an opposite

71
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,080
activity at a much higher dose and so

72
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,039
that explains how people can get sick

73
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,239
from THC acutely but that's quite

74
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:54,959
different from CHS canabo hyperemesis

75
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:58,840
syndrome because that is a Subacute a

76
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,680
chronic problem where people um will

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,840
have these increasing bouts of attacks

78
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:10,120
of nausea vomiting and abdominal pain um

79
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,598
and uh basically they go on until they

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,719
abstain um as we'll get into there are

81
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,000
treatments for it but uh they're a

82
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,639
little um different than what we'd

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
expect as

84
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,599
