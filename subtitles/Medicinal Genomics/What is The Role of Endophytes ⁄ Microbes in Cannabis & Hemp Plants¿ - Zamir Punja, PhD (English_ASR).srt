[Music]

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,400
So yeah, what what do we know? Are they

3
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,198
what kind of purpose are they are they

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,839
serving? Are they helping to carry out

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,520
certain process processes or or what's

6
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,879
going on there? So again, you know,

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,960
there's a fair amount of literature on

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,960
these endopites and microbiomes in other

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,679
plant species. So things like wheat and

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,359
corn and tomato and so we can learn

11
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,000
stuff from those plants because again

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,000
with with cannabis and hemp I think the

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,558
the earliest studies on microbiomes was

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,399
around 2020. So we've only been at it

15
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,679
for four or five years and and certainly

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,200
for cannabis or the the high THC strains

17
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,920
uh this has only been in progress for

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,239
about a year year and a half. So it's

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,399
relatively new for for these two crops.

20
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,238
But in other plants, there's these

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,920
microbes that sit on the root surface

22
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,399
that um seem to help absorb nutrients.

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,640
Um there's others that fight off uh you

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,719
know, pathogens that might try to gain

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,640
access to the roots. And then some of

26
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,280
these microbes enter into the roots, the

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,159
the beneficials or the the endopites.

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,478
And again, um some of the ideas are that

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,400
they do have some benefit. Um otherwise,

30
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,640
why would they be there? So, we've taken

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,359
the the opposite approach is that there

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,239
may be some in there that are not

33
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,239
beneficial and some of those would

34
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,158
include pathogens, right, that also gain

35
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,079
access to to the inside of the root

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,079
structure. And so, there's probably a

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,879
battle that goes on between the good and

38
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:37,039
the bad um within the the plant

39
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,679
structures. That part we haven't quite

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,000
figured out yet. Um what we've done up

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,040
to now uh using actually medicinal

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,680
genomics uh platform is to go through

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,759
and and sequence these organisms that

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,118
are there using you know what they call

45
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,239
whole genome sequencing where um using

46
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,799
your platform we're able to actually um

47
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,959
determine what what the species of these

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,000
microbes are based on their sequences of

49
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,478
of DNA. And so we've come up with this

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,239
quite a large volume of information that

51
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,840
we're sort of sorting through. I mean

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,640
what what does this mean? What is is

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,239
this X? Is this Y? Is this Z? And

54
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,399
eventually we'll come up with some sort

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,039
of answer to explain what these microbes

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,800
are doing. Right. And now are you trying

57
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,719
to kind of correlate to um the findings

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,680
that you have in the microbiome with,

59
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,280
you know, symptoms or morphology of the

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,360
plants themselves to try to make some

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,878
connections there? Yeah, that's really

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
hard to do, you know, because what we're

63
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,280
finding is that we there's no plant

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,439
there's no cannabis plant that is that

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,719
doesn't have a microbiome. Yeah. So, you

66
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,560
don't have you don't have a starting

67
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,639
point that's zero. So, everything that

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,640
we take up already has a microbiome in

69
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,359
it. So, you ask the question, well, if I

70
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,639
was to add X and Y, is that going to

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
make a difference or not? But you've

72
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,159
already got, you know, A and B sitting

73
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,400
in there already. And so, uh, it it

74
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,519
makes the evaluation of these new

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,719
microbes that you add more complicated.

76
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,640
Um, what what's A and B doing there? U,

77
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,359
we don't know yet. And so when you add,

78
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,759
you know, X and Y, what does A plus B

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,560
plus X and Y do together? We're not

80
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,519
really 100% sure. Um there's about two

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,560
or three recent reports that show that

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,719
when you do add X and Y back to whatever

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,959
is there already, there is some benefits

84
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,280
that you they do see sort of a

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,719
enhancement of growth. There's also

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,479
apparently an increase in some of the

87
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:35,280
canabonoids, but we we we need to be

88
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,280
sure that it's a consistent trend that

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,120
when you add X and Y that you're

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,120
actually going to see what you think

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
you're going to see, right? It must be

92
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
hard to try to control for all those

93
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,839
different variables. There's a ton of

94
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,439
variables and and that doesn't even

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,080
include the environment or or the

96
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,239
cannabis strain that you're using or the

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,040
fertilizer that you might be adding. So

98
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,120
that adds a lot of complications to to

99
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,519
what we might see. And again, similar to

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,039
the microbiome in our gut, you know,

101
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,560
depending on your diet, depending on

102
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,519
whether you take in a lot of yogurt,

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,759
depending on whether you take

104
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,080
antibiotics, that's going to influence

105
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,158
your your microbiome. I know yours is

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,480
different from mine because our diets

107
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,479
are completely different. So, there's a

108
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,480
lot of variables that also apply to

109
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,480
plants.

110
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:32,129
