00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,199
cannabis science medicine cultivation

5
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,239
and safety testing I am your host Ben

00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,439
Amaral I'm the marketing manager at

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,320
medicinal genomics and proud member of

8

the team that puts on the camed

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,759
conference first off I do apologize for

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,519
the lack of quality in the video here if

11
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,960
you're watching us I'm actually on the

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,440
road at a conference so I'm in a hotel

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,039
room with my fake background here um I

14
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,919
hope it's not too much of a distraction

15
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,719
it's only going to be for this intro and

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,439
for the outro the actual interview is

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,600
going to be the same quality that you

18
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,599
know and love but wanted to acknowledge

56
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:29,479
guest today is Dr Carla Gage Carla is

57
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,239
assistant professor of weed science and

58
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:35,399
plant biology at Southern Illinois

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,640
University Carbondale where she received

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,760
her PhD in plant biology with a focus in

61
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,039
weed ecology in

62
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:47,079
2013 in short Carla is a weed expert but

63
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,919
not in the weed that you smoke but

64
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,239
rather the weeds that you pull her

65
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,518
research focuses on using integrated

66
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,158
weed management to control and suppress

67
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:02,319
weeds in midwestern us rotational crops

68
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:04,719
including corn soy be wheat and now hemp

69
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,280
during our conversation we discussed

70
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,120
what negative effects weeds can have on

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,439
hemp which weed species are threatening

72
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,039
to hemp herbicides that are approved for

73
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,560
hemp and the threat of herbicide

74
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:21,919
resistance integrated weed management

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,479
strategies such as crop rotation cover

76
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:28,878
crops chaff lining plastic coverings and

77
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:31,119
more and how feral hemp varieties may

78
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,759
have traits to help breed for more

79
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,680
resistant hemp

80
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,719
varieties before we get to my

81
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,200
conversation with Carla I'd like to

82
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:43,400
thank this episode sponsor Rare Earth

83

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,319
partnership formed to accelerate hemp

85
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:51,239
research and produce critical tools for

86
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,919
the farmer re's mission is to increase

87
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,438
the likelihood of a successful Harvest

88
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,679
through genetic analysis and rigorous

89
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:02,078
Environmental Testing of vigorous

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,159
cultivars reliable data sets analytic

91
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,319
tools and stable germ plasm are core to

92
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:13,479
the program success for the farmer is

93
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,479
the goal you can learn more at rareearth

94

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,600
good afternoon Carla thanks so much for

101
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
joining us on the podcast hi good

102
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,800
afternoon yeah it's such a pleasure to

103
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,799
be here to talk with you today yeah I'm

104
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,120
excited to talk with you today about

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,478
weed control in outdoor hemp now we've

106
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,399
covered other plant pathogens on the

107
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:57,639
podcast before hop L and vroid pow

108
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,799
mildew pythium Bettis all those things

109
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,000
and even got into pests before with

110
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,600
russet mites spidermites Etc but never

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,399
weeds so this will be interesting um I

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,120
suspect that's because so much of

113
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,478
cannabis cultivation occurs indoors but

114
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,519
I know that the majority of hemp

115
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,038
cultivation is outdoors and after all

116
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,359
hemp and cannabis are the same plant for

117
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:22,918
all intents and purposes so be fun to

118
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,120
dive into this so let's start with the

119
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,159
basics what are the negative effects

120
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,519
that weeds can have on

121
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,800
hemp yeah well with any CR right uh

122
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:36,120
weeds can directly compete by uh taking

123
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,680
resources that the crop needs uh

124
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,800
resources like nutrients uh water space

125
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,600
um so there's that direct form of

126
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,800
competition but there are also other

127
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,680
indirect things that happen um for

128
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,360
example um cannabis can exude some

129
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,879
biochemical substances that can

130
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,759
interfere with the growth of other

131
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,800
plants potentially uh that's something

132
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,800
that my lab has been looking at but

133
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,038
weeds do the same same thing right so a

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,720
weed that's competing with a crop plant

135
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,439
may be releasing biochemical compounds

136
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,280
or having other effects on that plant

137
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,680
that are Beyond just the direct

138
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:14,679
competition for

139
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,759
nutrients great and now I know that hemp

140
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,639
can be grown for all different sorts of

141
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,199
things fiber um grain seed um and of

142
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,120
course cannabinoid Rich flour so are

143
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,160
there different considerations there for

144
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,560
how weeds can affect the crop for what

145
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,280
the crop will be used for

146
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,759
yeah so it's pretty amazing to look at

147
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,679
all the different um crop morphologies

148
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,800
meaning that if you're growing for each

149
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,759
of those different Commodities the crop

150
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,759
that you're growing is is going to

151
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,520
probably look different uh for example

152
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:51,680
if I'm growing a fiber crop that plant

153
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:55,079
has been bred over time to grow uh

154
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,840
directly upright to not Branch very much

155
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,560
uh and it's planted very densely

156
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,038
together in the field so for for weed

157
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,199
competition that would be a very

158
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,439
competitive crop and if it gets

159
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,598
established there should be relatively

160
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,160
few weeds coming up below that crop

161
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:13,560
canopy and you can contrast that with

162
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,080
how um Dual Purpose uh crops are grown

163
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,680
so those would be crops that you would

164
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:20,318
Harvest for both seed and fiber

165
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,079
potentially and those are typically

166
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,598
shorter plants they're a little bit more

167
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,598
branchy and uh they're spaced out more

168
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,639
in the field so there's more potential

169
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,199
for weed competition below that crop

170
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,319
canopy and then of course the most

171
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,280
sensitive type of cultivation to to weed

172
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,960
competition would be the CBD floral

173
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:43,918
biotype where you know those plants they

174
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,079
are branchy you know they are uh they do

175
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,359
take up a lot of space as they grow but

176
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,680
they're planted at um a pretty good

177
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,199
distance from one another and then you

178
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,360
have to do some weed control around them

179
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,158
whether that's you know uh black plastic

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,639
mulch or other organic mulches uh there

181
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:01,680
has to be some other type of weed

182
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,680
control tactic because the crop itself

183
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,519
is not going to suppress weeds as well

184
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,800
so yeah depending on what commodity type

185
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,959
you're growing the the weed control

186
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,840
problems are are can be dramatically

187
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:15,799
different yeah and are there any sort of

188
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:20,439
numbers around like weeds can affect

189
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,879
your your yield by X percent yeah so

190
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:25,000
actually that is such a fascinating

191
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,360
question and that is uh really one of

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,240
the things we're trying to determine

193
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,080
with our research uh in 2019 there was a

194
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,320
a publication that came out it was uh

195
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,879
basically a review of of all the global

196
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,278
literature looking at hemp cultivation

197
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:43,200
and uh in of the P of the Publications

198
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:45,439
that were reviewed uh weeds were either

199
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,120
neglected not even mentioned in the

200
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,120
Publications or they were mentioned as

201
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,679
inconsequential to the yield so that

202
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,720
brings up a a a really good question

203
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:59,799
right I mean we we know that this should

204
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,120
be a competitive crop hemp is uh is a

205
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:06,559
nitrophilous species meaning it should

206
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,240
be able to um you know uh accumulate

207
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,759
nitrogen and use nitrogen very

208
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,879
efficiently and uh could probably

209
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:17,319
outcompete a lot of other plants but um

210
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,559
the key seems to be uh getting it

211
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,399
established because even in our own

212
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,879
research we have seen a good number of

213
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,839
crop failures when the weeds come up

214
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,039
before the hemp or at the same time as

215
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,079
the hemp and uh and and then you know a

216
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,039
lot of times we don't even get a a good

217
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,759
hemp stand you know we see the weeds and

218
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:39,159
not the hemp so we know that competition

219
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,879
is a problem yet um the effects have

220
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,759
been

221
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,240
inconclusive and one of the things that

222
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,639
my lab has been working on um we do have

223
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,480
some uh some funding from the USDA as

224
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,879
part of a a larger multi-state project

225
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,759
and uh we've been looking at uh at what

226
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:57,320
is the called the critical weed-free

227
00:09:53,759 --> 00:10:01,159
period in hemp and and all crops have

228
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,399
this uh sort of the theoretical concept

229
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:06,120
where you know if you can control the

230
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,679
weeds during so many weeks initially as

231
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,519
the crop gets established then you can

232
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:13,159
maintain uh you know reasonable yields

233
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,799
by the end of the season so there's this

234
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,159
critical period when uh plants are are

235
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,879
more sensitive to competition and you

236
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,719
have to to Really take care of the weeds

237
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,879
during that period of time well we were

238
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,320
looking at this and uh there were

239
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,679
students in my lab that were weeding

240
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
hand weeding our hemp flots uh at

241
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,958
different intervals throughout the

242
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,799
season so some of the plots were not

243
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:36,239
weeded at all you know we planted the

244
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,879
hemp and and walked away basically and

245
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,159
then uh there was a there was a

246
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,120
treatment that was only weeded for a

247
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,039
week and then two weeks and three weeks

248
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,120
and so on and there was one treatment

249
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,240
that was weeded for the entire season um

250
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,399
so we were all a little surprised when

251
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,799
we did a preliminary analysis of the

252
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,839
data and we found that statistically

253
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:57,919
there was no difference whether or not

254
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,959
we we didn't weed the plants at all or

255
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,278
whether we weeded for 80 7 days which

256
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:07,278
was the entire season wow exactly

257
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:09,278
that's that's what we thought as well um

258
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,799
we could see a little bit of evidence

259
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,679
for um heavy grass competition so we

260
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,240
could see that the plots were had where

261
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,319
there was a lot of grass uh competing

262
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,680
around um those were our 14-day weed

263
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,200
weed treatments but but we could see a a

264
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,039
hit in the overall biomass uh with some

265
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,240
of the competition but it was just

266
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,519
amazing that statistically there was no

267
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
difference

268
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,639
so so we're now in our second year of

269
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,200
that study and we'll be um doing a more

270
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,480
um detailed data analysis and we'll be

271
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
looking at all the different yield

272
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,639
components because that was just a rough

273
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,440
look at overall biomass of uh fiber and

274
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:53,000
Dual Purpose crops so um so yeah it's it

275
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,399
seems like um it's one of those crops

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,839
where if it gets a head start it's it's

277
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,200
fairly competitive interesting yeah so

278
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,000
timing is everything yeah it is it is no

279
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,440
but so just want to make sure I heard

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that correctly so the amount that you

281
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,279
weeded whether you did none at all or

282
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,720
you weeded throughout the whole thing it

283
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:14,078
did it didn't have an effect on the

284
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,320
overall yield at the end it didn't on

285
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,919
the overall biomass that was produced

286
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,560
not looking at quality of fiber or

287
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,759
amount of seed yield so just overall

288
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,879
plant biomass now there may be

289
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,759
differences for each of those components

290
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,198
right because plants will uh in that's

291
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,319
it's an investment strategy right so um

292
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:36,879
they may have been investing in growth

293
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,560
and in structure and putting less into

294
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,720
seed production for example so uh now

295
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:44,119
that we have two years of data I I hope

296
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,800
that we're able to sort of tease apart

297
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,039
any any of those differences but um and

298
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,879
and now we do have of course we have a a

299
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,838
pre-emergence herbicide that's labeled

300
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:59,679
as well so if uh if Farmers want to grow

301
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,120
hemp now there's there's more um

302
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,359
more tools available to give the hemp a

303
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,720
head

304
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,159
start okay so that was going to be one

305
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,759
of my questions are there approved

306
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,639
herbicides for hemp H this is recent

307
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,078
yeah so there is now a pre-emergence

308
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,759
herbicide that would do hopefully um

309
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,439
what we're talking about and and give

310
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,120
the hemp the Head Start that it needs

311
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,360
for successful production um it's it's

312
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,120
not um there are going to be some

313
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,079
challenges for the weeds in our

314
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,720
geography not all of the problem weeds

315
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,479
are are going to be well controlled by

316
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,839
this herbicide but it's more than we had

317
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,320
before um so for Farmers that are um you

318
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,959
know accustomed to growing corn and

319
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,560
soybeans in herbicide managed systems uh

320
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,159
the the goal would be to see this as

321
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,239
another crop potentially in rotation

322
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,600
with those crops uh one of the reasons

323
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,919
that we have so much herbicide

324
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,600
resistance besides just the the sheer

325
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,278
amount of herbicides that we use um it's

326
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
because we have very simplified

327
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,078
rotations in our agricultural system

328
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,319
systems so if we could put more crops in

329
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:06,359
rotation with corn and and soybeans then

330
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,800
our Pest Management challenges would

331
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,079
would change and we wouldn't have um

332
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,319
such dominant weeds

333
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:16,078
theoretically right okay so a few things

334
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,839
I want to make sure that I that I touch

335
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,838
on with that question so the first one

336
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,959
you said do it was specific to your

337
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,320
geography so are there Regional

338
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:27,638
considerations here for for weed control

339
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,440
in hemp yes there are um you know some

340
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,159
species are not not uh uniformly

341
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,759
distributed across the United States

342
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:38,319
there are certain geographies that have

343
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:41,919
uh different problems um I think across

344
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,079
most of the the midwestern U cropping

345
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,278
region the amaranthus species are a

346
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:50,078
problem if you're familiar with

347
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,439
amaranthus seed it's it's basically

348
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:55,319
they're plants in the same genus as that

349
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,480
food crop that have become dominant

350
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,879
agricultural weeds and they've evolved

351
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,000
resistances to multip multiple

352
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,039
herbicides that have become a critical

353
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,360
part of our crop production systems so

354
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,399
um as they evolve very quickly we're

355
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,839
losing some of the herbicide tools that

356
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,679
our Farmers have relied upon and uh and

357
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,959
something there's something very special

358
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,879
about those weeds so those amaranthus

359
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:21,198
weeds are dous meaning that they are

360
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,078
males and they are females and they have

361
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:27,559
to cross-pollinate to produce seeds and

362
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:31,838
those are the only species in our system

363
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:33,719
that are what we call rver weeds that um

364
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,360
that are evolving herbicide resistance

365
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,278
so quickly so the genetic exchange

366
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,680
between those plants is in a sense

367
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:45,480
driving Evolution and genetic variation

368
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:47,239
and uh and of course the the plant that

369
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,000
we're introducing into the system you

370
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,278
know this is our first dious plant as

371
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,480
far as I've worked with that is a crop

372
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:57,318
species now and does that bring with it

373
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,519
other uh

374
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:02,039
challenges well potentially right

375
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,560
because uh hemp is the uh it's the

376
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:08,759
original weed

377
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:11,439
right the name yeah so uh you know we

378
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,959
have in Illinois a victory hemp left

379
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,839
over from World War II era that still

380
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:18,198
grows in the ditch Banks and roadsides

381
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,440
around agricultural Fields um so it's

382
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:24,120
still it still exists it still is

383
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,079
persistent so um that's another uh

384
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,039
another research question in the fields

385
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,799
where we're growing hemp for a crop you

386
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,278
know uh we're going to have to manage

387
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,318
those volunteers as we rotate into other

388
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:38,439
crops so how how easy is that going to

389
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,679
continue to be are we a are we going to

390
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,199
be able to continue to manage hemp which

391
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,359
is very susceptible right now to the

392
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:47,919
herbicides that we use so right now yes

393
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,560
yeah I'm I'm glad you kind of brought up

394
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,399
the the ditch weed that um is still out

395
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,159
there is that and is that a weed for all

396
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,159
intents and purposes for if you're

397
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:00,838
growing hemp could that potentially be

398
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,719
an issue issue um well it depends right

399
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,519
if you're growing floral uh CBD hemp

400
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,318
then

401
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,679
yes that is an issue for you in your

402
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:13,119
product quality um and potentially for

403
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,160
uh for other crops as well but I think

404
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,279
more importantly it's it's um it's

405
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,720
important to consider that as a

406
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:23,000
reservoir for very important genetic

407
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,078
traits that might be useful for future

408
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,558
Crop Production those plants have

409
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,079
existed for uh you know decades

410
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:31,798
successfully in these areas they are

411
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,359
tolerant to the environmental conditions

412
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,918
that they're being exposed to and to the

413
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,038
ecological interactions so so that

414
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,280
shouldn't be dismissed um I don't think

415
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:43,720
they should be devalued I think that in

416
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:47,480
the future they could have a very real

417
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,759
um a very a very real um contribution to

418
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,038
Future breeding

419
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,879
programs that's well that's actually

420
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:54,599
very interesting um I don't know if if

421
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,840
you're aware but here at mical genomics

422
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,480
we do um sequencing on cannabis

423
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,158
varieties temp varieties things like

424
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,798
that to help readers kind of identify

425
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:06,840
these traits I don't think we've ever

426
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,359
had any um ditch weed or any of that

427
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,319
that we've actually sequenced I know we

428
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:12,279
have some land race strains that are

429
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,839
kind of from other parts of the other

430
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:17,599
parts of the world but I don't know if

431
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,079
we have any that are um that are native

432
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,439
to the United States that would be

433
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:22,079
that'd be really interesting I'm gonna

434
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,558
I'm gonna bring that up to the CSO right

435
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,439
after this yeah yeah that would be um

436
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,319
you know in Southern Illinois we have a

437
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,240
very heavy soil type and and uh we find

438
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,678
that it interacts with our heavy spring

439
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,599
rainfalls so there's a there's a period

440
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,080
during the initial part of the Season

441
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,158
where you know we do have ponding in our

442
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,720
soils and you know it's it's really

443
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,039
difficult for the early planted hemp

444
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,720
crop to survive because it's it's not

445
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:49,798
very tolerant to um you know water

446
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,120
logging so uh that's where you know

447
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,918
maybe there is uh there's that trait

448
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:55,879
that exists in one of those weedy

449
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,919
populations that would allow it to

450
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,440
tolerate heavy soils a little bit better

451
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,320
so yeah those are the types of things

452
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
where you know I I do think there's a

453
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,918
lot of value in looking at those feral

454
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,558
populations that still exist interesting

455
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,038
okay all right so back to herbicides we

456
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,759
talked about that there are some some

457
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:16,359
approved or an approved herbicide that

458
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:19,240
that recently came online so um I know

459
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:21,918
that hemp is a bio accumulator so are

460
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,720
there considerations with that and using

461
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,480
like a an herbicide that it might you

462
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,600
know kind of accumulate in the in the

463
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,440
crop um yeah and I I guess I I'm

464
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,480
probably not the the best to talk about

465
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:40,960
herbicide tolerance levels uh so

466
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:43,120
residues in crops um I I yes I I do um

467
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,319
agree that hemp can be a

468
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,479
bioaccumulator um I guess the the type

469
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,000
of production that we're looking at um

470
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,159
I'm really more interested in seeing

471
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,400
fiber production so in that case um

472
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,840
anything that's bioaccumulated could

473
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,798
actually be a benefit if you use it for

474
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:03,038
remed ation purposes then uh you could

475
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:06,879
lock away those chemical compounds that

476
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,960
the plant takes up in in hempcrete um

477
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,799
you know into structures that are not

478
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,960
going to be degraded and released in the

479
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:17,319
future so so in that case um that could

480
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,480
be a benefit a beneficial characteristic

481
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:23,399
of that crop plant interesting you need

482
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,240
to be careful for other um food based

483
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,200
commodity types right for seed and

484
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,960
especially for floral uh production

485
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,038
yes um definitely and I know I think too

486
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,720
that there must be concerns also if

487
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:37,158
you're growing near other crops that

488
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,798
some of the herbicides that are maybe

489
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,720
used on those crops could drift into

490
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,918
your

491
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,919
Fields yeah and and we have seen that a

492
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:49,159
bit um herbicide drift has has been a

493
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,400
concern especially in some geographies

494
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,880
um we see that uh that hemp is sensitive

495
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,720
to some of those herbicides and uh in

496
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,039
some of the preliminary preliminary work

497
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,960
that we've done um we haven't seen a

498
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:06,240
huge yield impact when hemp is drifted

499
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,159
upon by other herbicides so again that

500
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,278
that does go back to the need to

501
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,840
establish herbicide tolerances and

502
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:15,319
safety levels on hemp depending on what

503
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:18,158
it's going to be used for in the

504
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:20,759
future and so given that you know hemp

505
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,360
was was banned for so long until kind of

506
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,798
the farm bill a few years ago kind of

507
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:28,918
open things up and so how far behind are

508
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:31,240
we in in researching you know uh weed

509
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,640
prevention and

510
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,919
hemp well

511
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:40,000
um really far behind yeah um yeah so

512
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,759
there's there's not really a lot known

513
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,880
as far as hemp's competitive ability um

514
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:50,038
I'm working with a colleague here at SIU

515
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,960
uh to to just set up some um species by

516
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,640
species competition studies just to look

517
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,240
at you know some of our most problematic

518
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,960
weeds uh put them in different numbers

519
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,440
growing with different number of of hemp

520
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,880
plants in in pots in the greenhouse and

521
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,159
just simply look at the impact of of

522
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,559
that competition at different densities

523
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,559
on that Target hemp plant uh so it's

524
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:14,240
just the the things that just a lot of

525
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:16,440
things that we don't know um in my mind

526
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,359
you could take pretty much any uh

527
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,880
publication that's been done in soybeans

528
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,439
you know looking at weed control and

529
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,919
probably redo that and it would be

530
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,720
completely novel and hemp uh so there

531
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,559
there's nothing but questions right now

532
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,600
uh very few answers

533
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:31,519
and we do have two herbicides actually

534
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,879
so

535
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,079
thein yeah ethol Florin is the

536
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,159
pre-emergence compound and then there's

537
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:42,199
a postemergence compound um which is

538
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,840
quizalofop or aeru is the trade name but

539
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,759
it's only a grass specific compound uh

540
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:48,918
so you can you can spray it across the

541
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,599
top of the hemp plants and uh and at

542
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,840
least kill the grasses that would be

543
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:54,240
competing but it's not going to impact

544
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,759
the the broadleaf plants that are

545
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,038
growing and competing with the hemp so

546
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,519
so it's but it's a you know it's

547
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,440
something right it's a it's a full

548
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:05,038
herbicide program a pre-emergence

549
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,640
compound plus a post-emergence compound

550
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,879
that that Growers are conceptually

551
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,759
familiar with working with and now are

552
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,799
herbicides the best tool against weed

553
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:18,640
control or are there other other options

554
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:22,240
they're the most commonly used Tool uh

555
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,840
it's partly as a as a um result of the

556
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,679
sheer number of Acres that our our

557
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:31,278
Farmers manage um you know if you go

558
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,759
into organic production for example

559
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:36,400
you're relying um either on tillage to

560
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:38,119
control the weeds up until a certain

561
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,120
point until you can't till anymore

562
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,599
without hurting the crop or you're

563
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:45,079
heavily Reliant upon uh cover crop

564
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,918
species that would suppress the weeds

565
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:52,000
and uh there is a potential to see cover

566
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,440
crops used in hemp production um I know

567
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,640
there have been some pilot studies that

568
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,919
have been conducted and uh you know the

569
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,440
cover crop literature is well

570
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,440
established that

571
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,759
you know you can suppress some of our

572
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,679
most problematic weeds with a with a

573
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:08,359
good uh cover crop that accumulates

574
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,200
enough biomass and that's really the key

575
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,879
is giving that cover crop the chance to

576
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,360
accumulate the biomass it needs and the

577
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,000
cover crop's not going to compete with

578
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:19,759
the hemp well you would uh you would

579
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,119
terminate it uh typically uh the way

580
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,599
that cover crops are grown ahead of corn

581
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:26,359
or soybeans um corn is a little bit more

582
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,798
sensitive so you terminate the cover

583
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:32,798
crop typically um before you plant the

584
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:35,398
corn uh soybeans are less sensitive and

585
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,918
some Growers are going into this this

586
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:39,479
program where they plant green meaning

587
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,640
that they don't kill the cover crop they

588
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,519
just plant the soybeans directly into it

589
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,679
and let the soybeans emerge and then

590
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,240
they come back and kill the cover crop

591
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,559
and again it's just going towards

592
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,599
accumulating the biomass uh there has to

593
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,240
be enough biomass for that cover crop to

594
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,879
suppress the weeds so they're just

595
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,278
trying to give the cover crop a little

596
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,440
bit of extra time after planting so

597
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,720
something Sim similar would have to be

598
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,278
done with hemp where uh you would kill

599
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,919
the cover crop and uh and we have a uh a

600
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:09,359
roller crimper planter where we can

601
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,159
terminate the cover crop by basically

602
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,959
mashing it down and creating a mat of

603
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,159
residue and we'll plant the crop into

604
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,720
that and clear spaces for the crop seeds

605
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,600
to emerge but then between the crop rows

606
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,679
we rely on the cover crop to suppress

607
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:29,079
the weeds interesting um so what other

608
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,159
what other tools are available to kind

609
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:35,519
of help control weeds yeah so uh again

610
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:38,679
going back to using hemp in a rotational

611
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,359
strategy um that's what I meant to

612
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:43,159
that's what I meant to come back to I'm

613
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:45,639
glad you excellent well I I think

614
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,840
there's a lot of potential because um

615
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,960
the the work that we've uh that we've

616
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:54,119
done that my lab has done um has shown

617
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,200
that some of our our our driver weeds

618
00:25:54,119 --> 00:26:00,079
the most problematic species don't

619
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:03,519
emerge well from hemp residue so uh

620
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:06,558
there is a system in um in management of

621
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:09,359
other crops called chaff lining and uh

622
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,440
you can think about a combine moving

623
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,079
across a field and harvesting soybeans

624
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,159
for example so the combine is collecting

625
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:19,720
the soybean seed and then out the back

626
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,919
of the combine all the residue the crop

627
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,960
residue the stems uh all the other

628
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,200
material is being deposited back on the

629
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,079
field well um Australian Farmers came up

630
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,278
with this really neat system where they

631
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:34,720
take the finest particles of that crop

632
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:37,200
and they funnel it into a line in the

633
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,120
back of the combine and not only is it

634
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,600
the the finest particles of the crop but

635
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,158
it's also the weed seeds so they deposit

636
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:48,319
the weed seeds in this crop residue it's

637
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,360
this this pile of biomass in a line um

638
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,079
and if you have Precision planting

639
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:55,398
technology then you make those lines

640
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:57,599
after every crop in the same place every

641
00:26:55,398 --> 00:27:00,239
year so you're always putting your weeds

642
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,599
seeds back in a line in the field and

643
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,720
then you know the the great thing is

644
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,319
they're they're going to be there so

645
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,600
that you can do other management

646
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,359
practices on top of that line you've

647
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:13,359
concentrated them it's not that you're

648
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:17,398
uh preventing them from germinating so

649
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:20,398
much uh but hemp on the other hand if

650
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:23,359
you were to use hemp in a chaff lining

651
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,759
strategy uh and look at the biochemical

652
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,839
properties of the hemp biomass there

653
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,798
might be the potential to suppress the

654
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,278
germination of those weeds because of

655
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:34,879
the the biochemistry of that crop plant

656
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:37,640
does so so that's one thing that that my

657
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,000
lab has conceptually looked at and a way

658
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,559
that I think hemp could actually be um a

659
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,200
positive

660
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,918
um a driver in um creating a more

661
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,720
sustainable rotational

662
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:55,679
system interesting so if I followed

663
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,679
so so you're kind of having all the

664
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,960
waste from from the previous harvest in

665
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,880
these lines and that includes the weeds

666
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,159
and the seeds and everything um and

667
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,120
typically those weeds will germinate but

668
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,120
with hemp they don't so what we found in

669
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:14,158
shaft lining systems in general we had

670
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:16,119
hoped that the seeds would Decay more

671
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,000
quickly because you're putting them in

672
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:20,839
in biomass where microbes are going to

673
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,960
be working harder right uh but we don't

674
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:25,839
see them decaying we actually see that

675
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,319
that biomass protects the seeds and they

676
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,439
can remain viable for longer

677
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,720
so that's not what we' hoped but at

678
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,080
least we can show that we're

679
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,480
concentrating the seeds in one location

680
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:39,879
if we concentrate them in hemp biomass

681
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,759
then then yes we do see a suppressive

682
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,440
effect of the hemp mulch uh I don't know

683
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:47,319
how long it will last it depends on you

684
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,960
know the amount of rainfall and and

685
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,480
microbial action so rainfall and

686
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,038
temperature would be major drivers of

687
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,960
that but um but yeah there's the

688
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,879
potential to get a little bit of added

689
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,440
benefit uh from compression of those

690
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,960
biochemicals found in hemp potentially

691
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,120
interesting so so going back to corop

692
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,600
rotation would hemp be a a good

693
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,918
candidate crop to be rotating with your

694
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:12,839
your soy soybeans or your corn or or

695
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,120
things like that oh I think it's still

696
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,359
unknown um so some of the Corn

697
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:21,479
herbicides may be a little bit hard on

698
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:23,678
hemp if you rotate uh from corn to hemp

699
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,278
um so that's uh that's something that

700
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,080
we' we've seen observationally but um I

701
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,919
haven't really Quantified

702
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,480
um so there can be some rotational

703
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,720
issues potentially but um it goes back

704
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,200
to you know if you really got the hemp

705
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,919
established you could get a really good

706
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,919
uh suppressive year where you didn't

707
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,120
have a lot of weeds germinate and that's

708
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,559
a form of Seedbank control right for

709
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:48,879
these uh summer annual plants that are

710
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,839
problems uh that are weeds in our in our

711
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,919
corn and soing systems uh their strategy

712
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,720
is just to produce seeds right if a

713
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,640
summer annual produces seeds then it's

714
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,600
it's basically one uh for that year uh

715
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,679
so we could possibly reduce seed

716
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,959
production if we can get a suppressive

717
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,840
stand of hemp and then any seeds that

718
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,558
are produced could be lined in a chaff

719
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,599
lining system potentially um but there

720
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,720
are a lot of uh questions as far as

721
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:18,439
rotational strategies you know um I

722
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,079
think it's unknown as far as the number

723
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,880
of pathogens that the crops may share in

724
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:26,558
rotation and I'm not sure if we know

725
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,760
which crop should follow which right now

726
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,639
you know what the best uh temporal

727
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:33,240
rotation really is so um I know there

728
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,278
are other people working on that so

729
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,919
hopefully um hopefully one day we'll

730
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:43,038
have an answer excellent uh what about

731
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,399
mulching or plastic covering um does

732
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:49,398
that does that help as well absolutely

733
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:52,000
yeah um that's one of the the more uh

734
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:54,558
common ways that I see um floral hemp

735
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,759
produced in our local geography is with

736
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,720
um plastic mulch of course that in

737
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:02,278
itself can have some environmental

738
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,960
sustainability implications um but any

739
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,679
sort of material that could be mulched

740
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,519
with so even an organic mulch material

741
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,399
that could suppress the weeds that would

742
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:15,000
be very helpful as

743
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:17,079
well excellent and in my research I I

744
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,720
will confess I am not a cultivation

745
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:23,319
expert but uh what is integrated weed

746
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:26,000
management so so that is uh that's the

747
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:28,158
um the focus of my lab

748
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,119
actually yes

749
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,840
GL

750
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:35,759
I we do a lot of work with herbicide

751
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:38,839
resistance and uh and I study herbicide

752
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,398
efficacy and the way that we should use

753
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:44,839
herbicides in our cropping systems to

754
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:47,079
control weeds but um if you look at the

755
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:50,839
evolution of herbicide resistance and

756
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:52,599
the increasing cases um it's very clear

757
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:56,558
that we're putting herbicides under a

758
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:59,319
lot of pressure uh so herbicid or weeds

759
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,960
are evolving herbicide resistance uh I

760
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,519
mean really faster than we can create

761
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,720
new herbicides at this point so

762
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,480
integrated weed management is the idea

763
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,639
that you um you should develop a more

764
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,558
Diversified strategy for weed control

765
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:15,278
and you should put more pressures on the

766
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:18,000
weeds besides just herbicides right it's

767
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,720
the same thing with uh you know um

768
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,359
microbial resistance to antibiotics it's

769
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,278
the same type of selection that's

770
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:28,959
happening so if we can put in um cover

771
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:30,720
crops and uh and harvest weed seek

772
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,120
control tactics like chaff lining like I

773
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,399
was mentioning um you know if we can

774
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,398
build an

775
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:40,479
ecologically um robust system where we

776
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:42,839
have uh seed Predators you know insects

777
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,120
in the field that are eating seeds uh

778
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,879
and we can you know capitalize more on

779
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,359
some of these ecological interactions

780
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,440
that are happening um then then that

781
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,479
integrated system you can still use

782
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,600
herbicides but you're putting less

783
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,679
pressure on the herbicides and you're

784
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,719
probably um at some point you're

785
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,159
beginning to slow the evolution of

786
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,519
herbicide resistance right yeah it seems

787
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,000
like herbicides are really the the

788
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:12,919
short-term solution but with really

789
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,240
potentially severe long-term effects

790
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,880
well you know and it's uh it partly goes

791
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,880
back to the need to be um you know

792
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,360
financially sustainable in the short

793
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,519
term and um you know learning to manage

794
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,759
other tactics like learning to manage

795
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,759
cover CR in the system it's like in a

796
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,558
way learning to manage a whole new crop

797
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,079
right so you're increasing the

798
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:37,759
complexity of the system whereas

799
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:40,278
herbicides are a simplified strategy but

800
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,919
they're um they come with a prescription

801
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:45,119
you know when to apply them you know

802
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,480
what to apply and uh and you're

803
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,719
relatively guaranteed to some degree a

804
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,558
success um if you do things in the right

805
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,120
way and when you start adding all of

806
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,558
these other tactics in then uh some of

807
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,158
the interactions become less predictable

808
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:02,278
and that means that the yields can be

809
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:05,000
less predictable and for a farmer who's

810
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:06,440
maybe not as comfortable financially it

811
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,719
can be very difficult to take those

812
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,599
risks so um so there's a lot to the

813
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,719
conversation as far as um you know the

814
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,599
adoption of more ecologically based

815
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,439
practices um it can be really risky for

816
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,838
some

817
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,679
people yeah no and that's a great point

818
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:25,440
and especially with hemp too I think um

819
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,918
a lot of people got into hemp production

820
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,240
particularly for CBD um assuming that

821
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,039
there was going to be this huge market

822
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,000
for it and then uh there was kind of

823
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,838
over production and the the prices

824
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,918
really fell through the floor so

825
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,078
definitely a

826
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:40,480
consideration yeah and for our Growers

827
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,440
here locally there there are a lot of

828
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,519
folks that are interested in in growing

829
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,280
fiber and um and potentially seed crops

830
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,039
but you know the market is still not

831
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,480
there to support them so they can

832
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,838
experiment on a small scale but there's

833
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,639
not going to be a you know a lot of

834
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,639
potential for that that return on

835
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,519
investment right now

836
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:02,838
yeah no I that is definitely the case

837
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:04,079
and I mean not to put you on the spot

838
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:07,400
and if if you don't want to answer this

839
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,960
we could certainly cut it out but um why

840
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,720
do you think that other types or other

841
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,079
Commodities associated with h really

842
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:17,279
haven't taken off yet it really has been

843
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:21,039
focused primarily on the

844
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,519
canabo yeah you know great question um

845
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:26,599
it's it

846
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:29,199
seems like it's kind of a a chicken and

847
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:31,440
the egg type scenario right I mean in

848
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,279
order to have a market that's built

849
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,480
around a commodity you have to have the

850
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,079
farmer that's going to produce it well

851
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,800
in order for the farmer to produce it

852
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:44,240
that person has to have a place to sell

853
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:47,240
it after they produce it so it's I think

854
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:50,838
more of a question of establishing some

855
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:53,919
of these basic uh Market initiatives

856
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:55,679
across a large scale right so you if

857
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,079
you're a processor if you want to

858
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,719
establish a processing facility that

859
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,200
means you know two years ahead of your

860
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,559
facility you're already reaching out and

861
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,679
Contracting up to a th Acres of

862
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:09,440
production with local Growers and then

863
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,078
you're working with them so that they

864
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,559
understand how to grow the crop and

865
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,440
you're providing some agronomic oversite

866
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:17,719
while you're building your facility and

867
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,159
then everything comes online and then

868
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:22,159
you have your Growers contracted and you

869
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,358
have your product coming in and then you

870
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:27,039
just continue to build capacity after

871
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:29,199
that so it's it's not it's it's not just

872
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,159
like building a facility and then it's

873
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,480
it's good right you have to have a

874
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:36,159
knowledgeable grower base to go along

875
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,280
with that to for that to be

876
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:42,598
successful got it well that is a great

877
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,440
answer so all right so winding down here

878
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,000
and you you've touched on it already but

879
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,720
I want to give you another chance to to

880
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,519
talk about so what's next what what are

881
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:52,000
you working on now and what can we

882
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:54,639
expect to see in the future yeah so

883
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,679
we're continuing to be part of a large

884
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,639
scale cul of our trial where we're just

885
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:00,919
planting different cultivars all across

886
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:04,719
the US and different geographies uh to

887
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,599
see what the um you know uh genetic by

888
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,519
environmental impacts are for each

889
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,318
cultivar so ideally uh you know I hope

890
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,239
that we can identify some cultivars that

891
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:15,519
do really well in Southern Illinois and

892
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:17,479
kind of expand our our grower options

893
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,318
here um so that's one of the things that

894
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,440
we'll continue to do and then uh we're

895
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:25,880
wrapping up our critical weed-free

896
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,639
period and uh um management study that's

897
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,000
funded by the US ta so uh within the

898
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,279
next year I hope to have all those data

899
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,599
analyzed and and published so that's

900
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,519
something to look for and then uh You'

901
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,640
mentioned cover crops I hope to

902
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,759
establish a couple of pilot cover crop

903
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:43,838
studies just to see what that looks like

904
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,640
because we've never really experience um

905
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,838
experimented with planting hemp into

906
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:51,799
cover crops at least not yet excellent

907
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,318
that sounds great um also want to give

908
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,039
you a chance to share any other

909
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:58,599
resources um that you think that the

910
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,358
audience might be interested in if

911
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:03,800
they're interested to learn more about

912
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:06,039
we control and how sure well um the

913
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,640
resources are still being developed so I

914
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:10,440
hope that those will be shared more in

915
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:12,480
the future but uh we do have a growing

916
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,519
cannabis Science Center here at Southern

917
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,240
Illinois University Carbondale so there

918
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,559
are some resources on the Cannabis

919
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,559
Science Center web page and you can see

920
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,318
what our diverse faculty group is is

921
