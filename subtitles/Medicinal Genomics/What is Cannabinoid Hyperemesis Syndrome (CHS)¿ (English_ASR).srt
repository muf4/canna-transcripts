1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,159
first what is this so this was a real

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:08,879
mystery it was first described in 2004

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,120
in Australia in eight patients but the

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,960
index patient first one that manifested

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,198
symptoms was cleared back in 1996 so you

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,679
can imagine going eight years with this

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:25,439
mysterious illness that nobody could

8
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:30,198
treat um they nailed the description

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,799
because what they've said um now uh

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,320
years ago is exactly the description of

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,280
the syndrome today which is a

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,399
combination of nausea vomiting abdominal

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,320
pain and hot water bathing behavior and

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,079
this was among people who had no

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,280
knowledge of other people being

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,799
similarly affected so it wasn't a matter

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,520
of one person saying hey if you take a

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:57,439
hot shower you'll feel better so this is

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,920
associated with cycles of of nausea

20
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,920
vomiting abdominal pain
