1
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:09,019
I think it is a very important event

2
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:11,359
here understand is the second second

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:14,359
time this is happening bringing together

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,600
all aspects of the field of cannabinoids

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:21,649
and what are the value of having this

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:26,000
field in health related issues so what I

7
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:28,509
want to do in these minutes I have is

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,579
talk to you about how we're approaching

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,800
this field and what my connection is

10
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,799
with the cannabinoids and perhaps give

11
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:43,899
you some feeling for where we are today

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:43,899
and where we are going so I I operate

13
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,710
something called the Center for drug

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,920
discovery and the Center for drug

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:58,159
discovery has as its mission to develop

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:00,679
new medications so do we have to have

17
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,468
some tools to be able to develop new

18
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:06,409
medications and I would say almost all

19
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:09,679
of our entire effort is based on the

20
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,569
cannabinoid system and to do this you

21
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:13,490
need a variety of tools that work

22
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:16,189
together you need to do some

23
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:18,259
biochemistry you need to do some

24
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:21,739
chemistry making compounds make a lot of

25
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:24,409
compounds we clone these receptors that

26
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:27,228
you have heard or the enzymes we study

27
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:31,159
their metabolism we do some biophysical

28
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:35,358
work and some computations and we also

29
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:38,420
do form ecology so this can be used this

30
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:40,759
approach and the tools can be used to

31
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,118
develop new medications however they can

32
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:47,418
also be used to study cannabis because

33
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:49,459
using the same approaches we can study

34
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:51,649
the different ingredients of cannabis

35
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:54,139
find out what each of these ingredients

36
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:56,659
does which is really the wave of the

37
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:59,868
future how we're going to find out more

38
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,880
about this it's just THC or is it THC

39
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:04,938
and CBD and cannot be general and other

40
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:10,310
things so we have all the tools to to do

41
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:13,789
that very quickly and you heard about

42
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,849
this is an old history he is starting

43
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:17,829
from China and then he came here to the

44
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,139
West

45
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,870
and you see way back in England and then

46
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,449
my good friend referred me shulam who

47
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,230
dis discovered and made delta nine

48
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:32,259
tetrahydrocannabinol 1964 so

49
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:35,560
subsequently i want to point out an

50
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:37,389
important ingredient of cannabis and

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,789
that is a trichome and you'll hear more

52
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:46,979
about it here but the trichome is a

53
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:46,979
little engine here it's a little engine

54
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,549
there we go

55
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,340
and manufactures all these ingredients

56
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,570
you know THC CBD the terpenes you've

57
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,219
heard a lot about the trapeze they're

58
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,079
all made here I'll give you a quick

59
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,569
glimpse of how these are manufactured

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,300
and for those who are not really

61
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:10,090
chemists or chemically oriented excuse

62
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,560
me but just follow how these things mix

63
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,509
together because they all come from the

64
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,460
same ingredients you mix them

65
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:17,469
differently you get a different array of

66
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,750
things that's why you have cannabis with

67
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:22,300
different proportions of constituents

68
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:28,209
etc but the building blocks are all the

69
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:32,170
same and you can see how these bioactive

70
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:36,009
molecules can have work in many

71
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:40,929
different conditions you've heard some

72
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:43,569
of them from dr. McCollum and then let

73
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,159
me identify the prints of all this

74
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:48,219
situation Delta nine

75
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:50,620
tetrahydrocannabinol THC which was the

76
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:53,139
beginning of the story prior to that we

77
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,520
didn't know very much about what's going

78
00:03:53,139 --> 00:04:00,699
on there but then a team during the late

79
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,189
80s we found out about these cannabinoid

80
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:05,709
receptors and now then we had some idea

81
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:11,919
how these things operate in the brain

82
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:15,250
and in the body itself and of course you

83
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,259
all know what happens if you smoke

84
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,279
cannabis you get an effect in the eye

85
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:23,139
and the heart all of these details here

86
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,219
dryness of the mouth and of course the

87
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:30,250
heart beat very quick heart beat and let

88
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,300
me spend just a couple of minutes on how

89
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,819
these ingredients

90
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,210
are manufactured you see they all start

91
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:39,520
from gimmick acid here mixed again they

92
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:41,258
need the sunlight coming in here and

93
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,878
this is one of the big building blocks

94
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:49,598
they cannot be general carboxylic acid

95
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:52,449
and you see the details here how they

96
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:55,779
keep building we start from the ad and

97
00:04:52,449 --> 00:05:00,728
they can go all the way to Canobie diode

98
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:02,348
or they can go to THC carboxylic acid by

99
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:05,110
the way what you find in the in the

100
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:07,628
plant as you know is not THC itself but

101
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,819
the THC carboxylic acid and then the

102
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:11,830
sunlight hits it or some heat or

103
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:17,020
something it drops out the carboxylic

104
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:22,930
acid becomes THC or while smoking it now

105
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:25,478
let me differentiate THC and CBD they're

106
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,329
actually very very similar these

107
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:31,810
molecules here all you need to do is tie

108
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:34,389
this oxygen in here it becomes from CBD

109
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,860
becomes THC and some people believe that

110
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,500
some of the CBD you take gets

111
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,080
transformed in the body into CBD in to

112
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,360
THC that's probably true and that's

113
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:45,339
probably how the reaction however if you

114
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,169
look at them chemically they have a very

115
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:54,189
big difference one of them is a flat

116
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:56,799
three cycles here it is tri cyclic and

117
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:58,810
abhaneri structure the other one this

118
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,028
tri cyclic structure is interrupted

119
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,430
right here and you see how they turn

120
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:06,759
around each other and they form CBD

121
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,250
because of that difference these

122
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,580
compounds appear to have very different

123
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:18,360
properties even very different way with

124
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:20,288
which they interact in the body now

125
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,259
additionally and you may have heard that

126
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:27,370
so THC has this tail

127
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:28,930
5 carbons very characteristic it turns

128
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,848
out that the tail is very important

129
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,139
because if you play around with the tail

130
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,329
and we did a lot of playing with these

131
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,759
things make all sorts of things and so

132
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:38,620
on the tail is very critical you make it

133
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,259
into a seven carbon tail all of a sudden

134
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,689
becomes much more potent however the

135
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,879
plant also has some ingredients that

136
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,160
have only

137
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:52,540
that have only three carbons in the tail

138
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,720
and they're called Canada Varian this is

139
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,819
gonna be very in dial this is gonna be

140
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,560
very in itself of the carboxylic acid

141
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,099
very much so so the difference is right

142
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,550
here

143
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:06,400
this has five carbons the THC this is

144
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,680
three carbons is that cannot be very why

145
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,959
is it important it looks like this also

146
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,000
plays some role there's some intriguing

147
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,069
things happening and they've been using

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,860
it with combinations we don't know

149
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:25,980
exactly what it's going to go now the

150
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,980
major metabolic pathway as you see here

151
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,250
oops

152
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:39,459
you have THC and then it gets

153
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:41,979
metabolized here that's very important

154
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:45,129
when you put one oxygen here very

155
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,810
important eleven hydroxy THC but then

156
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:50,409
when you put one more oxygen it becomes

157
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:54,009
a carboxylic acid and that is not active

158
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:57,550
in fact when you do forensic medicine

159
00:07:54,009 --> 00:08:05,550
etc you measure the amount of Delta 9

160
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:08,889
THC carboxylic acid now you heard that

161
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,918
from dr. McCollum way back from Israel

162
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:17,709
talking to us here and tell you how we

163
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:20,199
found out why this THC does its job it's

164
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:23,139
because it has some targets some

165
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:26,469
switches and these switches are what

166
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:28,089
produce the different effects of THC I

167
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,669
like to talk to you about these switches

168
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:33,250
there are really two receptors we call

169
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:35,439
them GPCRs or g-protein coupled

170
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,379
receptors and if you look at them

171
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,200
schematically if you look at the year

172
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:42,879
they have these seven hilly seas then

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,100
they have these three loops here three

174
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:49,439
loops here one tail on the top one tail

175
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:51,670
at the bottom and it turns out that also

176
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,460
another friend of it was discovered

177
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:56,319
about three years later and that's a cb2

178
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,300
and

179
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,240
what we know today that there are only

180
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:04,029
two cannabinoid receptors the cb1 and

181
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,029
cb2 but they do talk to each other very

182
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:09,519
well they combine to produce effects

183
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:12,100
they work either synergistically or in

184
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,659
different directions so we have been

185
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,070
very interested in these things and

186
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,439
we've been working with these for a

187
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,870
while we actually make them we clone

188
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,810
them and make things with them and also

189
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:27,639
you see they're distributed differently

190
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:29,109
you see here the the cb1 is distributed

191
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,960
in all of these places including liver

192
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,779
very important actually surprise liver

193
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,230
and also the fat cells that's why it C

194
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:40,990
b1 has a lot of control on the heat

195
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,500
that's produced in the body but also the

196
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:48,490
fat content of the body the CB tools are

197
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,899
more in places like the spleen and also

198
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:56,039
in anything that has to do with

199
00:09:49,899 --> 00:10:00,399
inflammation and this is a very complex

200
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:02,230
picture but you see basically what we

201
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,389
have here you heard about something

202
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,370
called the synapse this is the nerve

203
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:09,129
this is them and the Tor acceptors are

204
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,810
sitting on the upper part of the synapse

205
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:12,939
which is called the pre synaptic

206
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:15,069
Junction here so there are the two

207
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,260
players so if you want to tweak them and

208
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,270
that's what THC does it tweaks both of

209
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,490
them works on both of them a lot of the

210
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:25,029
ingredients of cannabis tweaks both of

211
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:28,779
these and then we have these enzymes

212
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:30,220
there's one that breaks one set of of

213
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:33,600
these are the cannabinoids the other

214
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:37,840
breaks the other set so for a chemist

215
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,590
got a lot of different switches can play

216
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:44,649
with also when we take these cannabis

217
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,690
they affect all of these switches they

218
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:48,730
affect the production of these so if you

219
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,070
want to really learn about it in some

220
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,620
detail you need to go after all of these

221
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,690
switches to understand how they work and

222
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:00,870
to make compounds that turn these

223
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,870
switches on and off agonist antagonists

224
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:08,980
now here is a little thing here your

225
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:10,029
soul looks here and now here is the

226
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,550
receptor

227
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,610
and we did some work early on to see how

228
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:19,479
this receptor is turned on you see right

229
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:22,389
here this molecule here is produced in

230
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,039
the membrane it's right there and guess

231
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:27,069
what this is an animal you've heard

232
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,209
about it and the way it turns it on see

233
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,870
this tail here

234
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:34,750
this is helix six its tinkers at tail

235
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:37,210
and as a result of this the receptor is

236
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,929
turned on acceptor is turned on what

237
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,000
does it mean

238
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:45,789
means your mouth is right your eyes are

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,009
shot it's an agonist now you also know

240
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:52,929
this this is what we call a phyto

241
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:54,279
cannabinoid right here THC and from

242
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:57,370
these guys here which are the

243
00:11:54,279 --> 00:12:00,850
endocannabinoids there are two families

244
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:04,000
actually there are two of them and an

245
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,759
amide and twerkin and a glycerol and the

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,080
other sort of over the princess of the

247
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:16,000
endogenous area are they the only ones

248
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:19,060
well let's see so you see these are

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,519
actually molecules and they're not very

250
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:24,969
important you know you'd think for

251
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,069
example this molecule is less potent

252
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,430
than THC but then you can make a

253
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:33,100
molecule and we have that is a hundred

254
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:35,109
times more potent very very important so

255
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,839
by tweaking molecules by playing

256
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,570
chemical games you can produce molecules

257
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,440
that can do modulate a lot of the

258
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:50,470
functions of cannabis itself but also

259
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:53,080
the endogenous compounds and as a matter

260
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,230
of fact because we're used to saying an

261
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,930
amide into AG the story is longer

262
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,240
there's a whole family of those and they

263
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:04,509
all get but these sort of made the good

264
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,470
news to AG in and an amide so we decided

265
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:11,049
to make all of them and also tag them so

266
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,029
as we come to measure the ingredients we

267
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:15,849
have exactly right we put them in

268
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:21,458
repository among them etc and you see we

269
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:23,290
made all this family very useful now you

270
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,948
mentioned about these and the

271
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:27,219
cannabinoid

272
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:30,159
they are made up from enzymes inside the

273
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,899
body and these enzymes are all present

274
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,328
in the membrane and they work together

275
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:39,369
and sure enough at the end of the day

276
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:44,618
they make what we know which is an an

277
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:47,709
amide is an an amide right here or two

278
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:49,509
AG right here and these you can't have

279
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,308
them just floating around forever

280
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:54,938
they have to be destroyed after they do

281
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:56,980
their job and there are enzymes here

282
00:13:54,938 --> 00:14:00,938
that do that there's an enzyme that

283
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:03,039
breaks down all these esters and an

284
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:05,259
enzyme that breaks down these amides

285
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:11,498
they called far fatty acid amide

286
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:13,568
hydrolase they called mono acyl glycerol

287
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:15,189
lipase and some other enzymes and we

288
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:16,778
work with all of these actually this a

289
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,730
very intriguing enzyme don't have time

290
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:25,629
to talk about it today but it does a lot

291
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:28,869
with inflammation now okay so we we have

292
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:31,438
now the tools what do we do with the

293
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:34,720
tools we'll be spending a lot of time

294
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:37,118
making molecules also studying the

295
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,949
switches what do they look like with a

296
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:39,339
lot of biophysical work that sort of

297
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:42,308
thing

298
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:45,059
why do we do that for two reasons first

299
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:49,899
we want to understand what cannabis does

300
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:53,798
how these effects are modulated if you

301
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:58,119
smoke cannabis but also we want to

302
00:14:53,798 --> 00:15:02,828
discover new molecules that produce good

303
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:07,389
results for health issues so it's a two

304
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:09,698
hand operation on one hand we want to

305
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,948
accrue all the benefits that you can get

306
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:18,058
from cannabis but hand-in-hand with that

307
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:23,409
we also produce new molecules that make

308
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:27,368
health related issues and and we use

309
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:30,249
this model how to make these and we have

310
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:31,959
actually made quite a few of those just

311
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:34,058
to give you an example we've made

312
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,629
compounds for appetite am six five four

313
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:39,329
five neuropathic pain you heard about

314
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:41,100
that neuroprotection somatic peripheral

315
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,830
pain a very interesting molecule we just

316
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,580
made it now and also you heard that how

317
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,590
these fight addiction so we have now the

318
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,030
tools we have been working a lot of

319
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,860
these made a lot of compounds some of

320
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:56,879
them you may recognize them under the am

321
00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:03,659
number am 251 and whatever it is my name

322
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:06,419
McCree honest greek name okay so now how

323
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:08,850
do we make these we have we need to have

324
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:10,589
some template and we started doing this

325
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:14,759
with a nice discovery in which we made

326
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:18,420
just very recently and what we did is we

327
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:22,039
took one of these receptors the cb1

328
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:24,959
receptor and made it into a crystal

329
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,939
first time made very tricky very tricky

330
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,360
business been working a long time with

331
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,470
my colleague ray stevens who also

332
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,440
crystallographer want to show you what

333
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:38,100
they look like here we go this is a

334
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,260
molecule we made right here am 6 5 3 8

335
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,930
turns out to be a cb-one antagonist we

336
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:46,500
know exactly now how it fits right here

337
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:49,079
and that's important to us because we

338
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,960
could use this as a template to come in

339
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,340
and synthesize before we synthesize just

340
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,080
ongoing the lab and just make anything

341
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,910
we need to know what we're gonna make

342
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,250
and how we're going to make it this

343
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:02,519
gives us a template then and this is the

344
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,629
cb1 cannabinoid receptor structure some

345
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:11,129
more pictures here

346
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:13,380
more details right here and then using

347
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,240
this we could use a computer and put

348
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:21,780
these different molecules in to see how

349
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:24,449
they fit in that hole there and then we

350
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:27,029
come to the end of my talk i try to give

351
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,580
you a sense how you could take cannabis

352
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:31,859
and the new medications that are

353
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:35,309
synthetic medications good medications

354
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:38,299
both of them very valid we work on both

355
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:38,299
sides thank you

356
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,679
you
