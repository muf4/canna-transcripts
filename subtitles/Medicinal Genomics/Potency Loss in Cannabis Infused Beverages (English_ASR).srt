2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,079
so you recently wrote an article on

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,240
Linkin um explaining some of the

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,879
challenges for this potency loss and you

5
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,439
kind of kicked it off saying that you

6
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:28,479
did a a poll of your followers to asking

7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,198
what they think is the most important

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,439
factor in you know preventing potency

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,359
loss and it seemed like most people

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,558
thought it was sort of this Emulsion

11
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,840
technology or the infusion technology

12
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,878
which is what you were describing um so

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,320
first of all do you agree with that

14
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,960
assessment and um why do you think

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:53,519
people think that that is the most

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:56,198
important um um I have seen issues uh of

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,320
the downst PO issues happening and the

18
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:01,198
root cause could be the emotion right I

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,840
have seen that but I also have seen um

20
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,158
many other areas along the supply chain

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,000
of making the can beverages when any of

22
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,400
the sector has issues or problems the

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,319
accumulated effect is contributing to

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,840
the end results which is pocy loss so um

25
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,478
yes the infusion tag is very important

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,680
because because it's complex right

27
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,679
because the infusion tag itself needs to

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,439
be stable right uh and then when you put

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,439
that infusion tag the emotion or

30
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,078
whatever

31
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,478
technology into the beverages it needs

32
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:37,158
to be stable in the beverage so it the

33
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,599
self- stability and the beverage

34
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,920
stability are two aspects right so

35
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:46,599
sometimes it's um it's hard to assume

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,840
you have a stable Emotion by itself and

37
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:51,239
you're going to have a stable product no

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,040
we have seen this um failure time and

39
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,959
time again um and you have to really

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,039
assess like the two lanes right make

41
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,959
sure you have a stable emotion but also

42
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,399
this is the most interesting part and

43
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,359
complex part because emotion could be

44
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,038
you know two to three formulas or four

45
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,120
formulas this could be a thousand skews

46
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,559
right they are having different PHS they

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,200
have different ingredients heat

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,080
stability packaging so it's it's really

49
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,560
the wild part of expanding the emotion

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,480
into the finished product so that's

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,199
where vertosa actually spend a lot of

52
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:28,280
time understanding our clients uh from

53
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,238
the industry okay what kind of um

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,800
beverage for formulation they are what

55
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,759
kind of packaging Co co- manufacturers a

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,200
testing lab so I know you're going to

57
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,799
dive into it but you know that's

58
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,919
essentially the whole supply chain that

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,400
could potentially impact the pocy yeah

60
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,878
no and you're right we're going to get

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,439
into kind of the different parts of the

62
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,878
supply chain but before I we get on to

63
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,598
that um I wanted to ask so when we're

64
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:55,079
talking about losing potency how much

65
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,280
are we talking about here like um are

66
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,519
there is there sort of a standard rate

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,680
of potency

68
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,239
loss um

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,200
if you ask me the standards you

70
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,480
know for beverages there are regulated

71
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,359
beverages by States and there are hemp

72
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:17,199
beverages so if you if you ask by um uh

73
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,440
state by state there is a 10 to 15%

74
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,359
variation from the label claim right but

75
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:26,639
if you ask me about hemp beverages so

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:29,000
far there is um no strict regulation yet

77
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,878
right so which the industry I know

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,120
they're advocating for um better

79
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:39,238
regulation better standards um so

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,319
um yeah the the hand beverages could

81
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,719
have you know a huge loss over the shelf

82
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,919
life right the shelf life they Brands

83
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,759
claimed and some some Brands may have um

84
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,078
you know not as much lost over the shelf

85
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:56,359
life some Brands may have a huge loss so

86
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:59,400
we see this um huge difference and we

87
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,400
see there's um big need for the industry

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,680
to better ourself because consumer love

89
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,480
this product and consumer need this

90
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,799
product and if we don't do a good job to

91
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,518
if we lose the trust of consumers and

92
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,400
they say okay all those hand beverages

93
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,560
are finicky and they don't give me

94
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,798
enough minrs on the claim I think that's

95
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,918
detrimental to the whole thing so that's

96
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:27,239
where verosa as a it try we try to lead

97
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,879
the conversation and educate our

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,519
partners and clients hey you need to to

99
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,519
pay attention to all the details that

100
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,599
leads to pocy loss you can't just assume

101
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,839
you had a good emotion you have a good

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,680
co manufacturer then everything's fine

103
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,439
right so that's where we want try we

104
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,879
want to try to uh educate people yeah

105
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,478
and I have to imagine with so many

106
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,639
different brands out there and so many

107
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:52,478
different products um using so many

108
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,120
different technologies that there

109
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,918
without sort of that standardization

110
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,319
like you're right I mean some consumers

111
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,159
might um experience a potency loss with

112
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:02,680
one and and sort of apply that to

113
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,919
everyone else where that's not really

114
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,879
the case right right I I feel the

115
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:12,399
history will we're early right it's it's

116
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,279
2024 we are early in this um canvas

117
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,758
beverage sector and more research are

118
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:21,000
needed more regulation are needed right

119
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,360
so I I'm strongly um advocate for for

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,360
those to happen

121
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:38,899
a

122
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:38,900
