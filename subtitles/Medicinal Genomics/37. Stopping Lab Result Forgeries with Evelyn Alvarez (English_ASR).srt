manager at medicinal genomics and proud

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,440
member of the team that puts on the

9
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,399
canmed conference

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,479
okay

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,640
you probably already know by now but

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,279
after careful evaluation of the current

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
situation in los angeles county and the

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,079
restrictions and requirements that would

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,359
have been necessary to hold canmed 2021

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,039
in september

17
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,359
our management team has made the

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,239
difficult decision to reschedule the

19
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,719
event from may 3rd through 5th

20
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,799
2022

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,640
this was not an easy decision to make

22
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,479
it's been almost two years since we had

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,320
a live canmed event

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,399
but everyone including the conference

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,719
organizers our sponsors and the

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,040
presenters strongly believe that in

27
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,118
order for canmed to be a success

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,880
it must take place in a comfortable

29
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,560
collaborative environment

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,719
and that's just not possible during

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,799
these uncomfortable and restrictive

32
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,478
times

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,479
so we will press on

34
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,640

50
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,438
i had the pleasure of speaking with

51
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:09,038
evelyn alvarez the quality assurance

52
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,878
director at encore labs evelyn has 10

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,519
years of experience working on

54
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,840
analytical instrumentation and in

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,200
regulated lab environments including

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,280
work on epa and osha methods

57
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,439
she received a degree in environmental

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,039
science with research experience on

59
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,840
pesticides

60
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,639
evelyn was recently quoted in a refinery

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,680
29 article that revealed an unfortunate

62
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,639
element of the unregulated delta 8 thc

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,959
market

64
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,559
that being that some delta 8 thc

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,120
producers will falsify lab results

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
also known as certificates of analysis

67
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
that they post online

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,039
we cover that topic and others in our

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,680
discussion including

70
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,439
how coas differ from state mandated

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,519
compliance tests

72
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,158
how the lack of regulatory oversight of

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,200
delta 8 thc products puts consumers at

74
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,439
risk

75
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,560
red flags consumers can look for when

76
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,598
reviewing coas online the recent

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,400
increase in delta 8 thc products

78
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,280
how the process of synthesizing delta 8

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,080
thc from hemp may introduce contaminants

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,318
that most labs are not testing for and

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,000
more

82
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,158
before we get to my conversation with

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,799

[Music]

104
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,599
good afternoon evelyn thanks for joining

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,439
us

106
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,840
hey thank you for having me very excited

107
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,439
to talk about these uh very important

108
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,000
topics for consumers

109
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,560
yeah about that so

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,040
you were quoted in a pretty wild article

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,918
that came out last month on the website

112
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,919
refinery29

113
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,959
i find the story concerning in a lot of

114
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,799
ways

115
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,959
but uh let's just start i guess with the

116
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,160
general premise so i don't know if if

117
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:51,039
you want to kind of explain

118
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,040
how you got involved in all of this or

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,280
if you want to if you want to do that

120
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,400
first sure yeah into some of the

121
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,399
concerns that it raises

122
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,758
yeah so uh a while back we got email to

123
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,719
our our

124
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,479
lab

125
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,639
uh and

126
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,560
molly the journalist from refinery29 was

127
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,120
reaching out initially just asking some

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,879
very straightforward questions about a

129
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,399
delta a product that she was going to

130
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,918
write a

131
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,839
review piece on

132
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,799
uh when i started digging into the

133
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,959
sample

134
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,840
information i realized that the reports

135
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,038
were very clearly fabricated just

136
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,079
completely

137
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,680
made up

138
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,519
uh when i reached back out to her with

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,199
that information she was pretty blown

140
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,758
away as well and that just kind of

141
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,160
started a good back and forth between

142
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,479
her and i which ended up turning into

143
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,520
this great piece by her i i mean she

144
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,439
really went down the rabbit's bowl and

145
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,159
spoke to many different people in the

146
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:51,360
industry you know from researchers to

147
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,600
regulators it turned into be a good

148
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,680
highlight for for everyone you know for

149
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,280
consumers especially in terms of safety

150
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,759
yeah exactly so

151
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,198
so basically molly had taken this delta

152
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,520
thc delta athc gummy and had a pretty

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,759
intense experience right more intense

154
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,120
than she was expecting or that was

155
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,038
advertised

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,439
and so she she went to the website and

157
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:19,038
looked at the coa that was listed there

158
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,719
um as many of these products have and

159
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,399
she looked at it everything looked good

160
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,240
less than 0.3 percent thc no residual

161
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,839
solvents everything looks good but she

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,639
goes one step further and actually

163
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,198
reaches out to the lab how

164
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,240
how common is that do consumers actually

165
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,120
reach out to your lab to confirm a coa

166
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,120
that they see online

167
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,319
prior to delta eight not very common

168
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,079
now that delta eight products have

169
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,000
become more and more popular we've

170
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,198
gotten a lot more inquiries to to our

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,199
line and it's it's good it's good that

172
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,160
people are asking these questions that

173
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,038
you know

174
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,000
there unfortunately is fabrication out

175
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:02,000
there um there's unfortunately not

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,120
enough education about what these

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,399
products are and what uh regulations if

178
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,079
any

179
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,719
that there are so

180
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,959
the more that people can call in and ask

181
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,840
us questions you know we're we're happy

182
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,638
to help

183
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:21,038
essentially relay the data to them we we

184
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,478
can't go into

185
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,038
safe

186
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:28,959
in terms of the physicians end of things

187
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,959
but we can interpret the results

188
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
right so i guess before we get too deep

189
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,319
into it can you briefly explain sort of

190
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
what a coa is and why is it important

191
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,439
for cannabis users and patients in terms

192
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,959
of product safety

193
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:48,478
yeah so uh coa

194
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,000
simply put is a

195
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,680
summary of the results of testing

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,519
performed on the product

197
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
so coa stands for certificate of

198
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,598
analysis

199
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
depending on the number of tests

200
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,680
requested it can tell you a lot about a

201
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,478
product so

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,038
uh it's cannabinoid profile you know how

203
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:10,639
potent it is how much thc or cbd is in

204
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:13,918
it it's terpene profile uh we

205
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,400
test for a lot of harmful things

206
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,918
things like pesticides heavy metals

207
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,038
residual solvents microbials mycotoxins

208
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,279
um

209
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,759
all of those are important in terms of

210
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,758
safety if we detect it's one of those

211
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,400
harmful compounds you know you shouldn't

212
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,158
be consuming it um

213
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,079
just the ponzi profile alone is

214
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,439
super important for the consumer

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,599
uh if they are purchasing these cbd or

216
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
delta eight products how do they really

217
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,640
know

218
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,480
that that's what is in the product or

219
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,399
how do they know that it doesn't contain

220
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,680
delta nine thc

221
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,639
um

222
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,879
i've heard of situations where

223
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,799
people consume cbd products and then end

224
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,799
up failing a drug test

225
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,559
uh you know maybe if they would have

226
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,000
gone one step further to look for for

227
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,518
the report

228
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,889
it could have helped

229
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,839
um

230
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,799
[Music]

231
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,880
but

232
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,439
even the

233
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,600
more importantly for

234
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,480
patients that are trying to dose

235
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
if

236
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,200
they want to make sure that what is

237
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,278
labeled on the container is actually

238
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,839
what it contains so that they can have

239
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,120
accurate dosing for whatever it is that

240
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,320
they're trying to

241
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,320
to focus on

242
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,278
exactly and so

243
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,200
so the coas that the manufacturers put

244
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,639
up on their websites it seems like a lot

245
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,320
of the things that they're testing for

246
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,159
is similar to what you would do for

247
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,879
compliance testing for products that are

248
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,039
on a dispensary shelf is that is that

249
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,120
fair to say is it is it really the same

250
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,360
battery of tests that are done for these

251
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,600
coas is it does it depend on what the

252
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,278
manufacturer requests what are the

253
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
differences between the two types of

254
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,240
tests

255
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,680
that is a very important question uh it

256
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,240
really depends on what they are

257
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,639
requesting for testing

258
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,799
for compliance testing here in the state

259
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,919
of california there are very specific

260
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,679
regulations that we follow uh

261
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,360
really from the beginning of testing to

262
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,479
the end and i can kind of get into that

263
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
um

264
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,278
how the sample arrives to the lab

265
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,559
and this is important

266
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,720
for

267
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,479
a compliance sample

268
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,600
we are required to send one of our

269
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,959
trained samplers out to

270
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
the facility

271
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,559
and we're required to sample something

272
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,799
that is unbiased and representative and

273
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,879
there are a lot of other requirements

274
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,199
say the larger the batch size is the

275
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,078
larger sample we pull

276
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,079
so

277
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,599
even just getting to the lab a

278
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,359
compliance one is is something that

279
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,159
we picked

280
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,278
uh we refer to non-compliant samples as

281
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:59,120
r d so things like cbd and delta eight

282
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,639
that are submitted uh those don't have

283
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,440
any requirements

284
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,278
manufacturers can send them in um

285
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,640
they can drop them off

286
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,958
they can cherry pick if they still wish

287
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,679
uh it's unfortunate but they do

288
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,399
um so

289
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,159
number from the get-go you're getting

290
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
something

291
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,159
potentially different than what you're

292
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,040
buying because of how it was submitted

293
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,319
uh when it gets to the lab

294
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,719
that was a great question that you asked

295
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
what kind of testing is performed so for

296
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,278
compliance testing

297
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,639
we

298
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,720
perform the whole gambit that the state

299
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,799
requires so a lot of what i mentioned

300
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,120
earlier pesticides microtoxins heavy

301
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,838
metals however for these

302
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,078
non-compliance tests it's whatever the

303
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,480
manufacturer requests so if they're only

304
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,039
concerned about cannabinoid profile

305
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
that is the only thing that

306
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,159
we test because they have no

307
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,439
requirements

308
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,199
um

309
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,200
so if it did have something harmful

310
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,200
since we're not testing for it

311
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,278
there's really no way for that to be

312
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,600
communicated to anyone

313
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:03,600
um

314
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,399
yeah besides that and

315
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,440
sorry go ahead no sorry and then and

316
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,600
furthermore even if that were

317
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,000
requested by the manufacturer

318
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,159
say microtoxins or heavy metals or

319
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,440
something like that

320
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,838
if you report that back to the

321
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,959
manufacturer is there any mechanism for

322
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,600
that to be reported also to some sort of

323
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,439
regulator or anyone to

324
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,399
make sure that that product still

325
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,360
doesn't

326
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,399
make it to the market like i assume

327
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,519
is in place for compliance testing

328
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,839
yeah another huge difference there is no

329
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,078
requirement for that information to be

330
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,000
submitted anywhere else than to the

331
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,919
person that requested it for anything

332
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,039
that is non-compliance

333
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,360
for

334
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:54,159
our compliance results the state has

335
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,320
really specific regulations when when we

336
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,919
finish and approve

337
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,120
the results we're required to

338
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,719
simultaneously report it to the

339
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,879
distributor that the people who

340
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,278
submitted and requested the testing to

341
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,759
the state of california the department

342
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,519
of cannabis control and we have to

343
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,679
upload it to a system

344
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,560
a track and trace system in california

345
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,638
we use metric and

346
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,799
all of that keeps

347
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,959
you know digital

348
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,519
data for everything so

349
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,599
even if this uh distributor tried to

350
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,200
transfer it elsewhere say to a retail

351
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,519
shop they won't be able to do that

352
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,639
because those failed results

353
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,320
are stuck with it um and even so since

354
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,240
we notified the the

355
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,639
department of cannabis control they're

356
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,480
already going to take action on that

357
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,159
but for these non-compliant samples um

358
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,800
those manufacturers really aren't

359
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:51,198
required to do much uh you know

360
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,039
maybe they're good actors and they're

361
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,198
going to go back and remediate their

362
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,360
match and submit again for testing and

363
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,879
then sell the product but maybe they're

364
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,959
not and they're just going to

365
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,919
submit a different sample and still push

366
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,919
it through elsewhere

367
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,399
right and you and like you mentioned

368
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,120
earlier the fact that they can sort of

369
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,120
submit samples that may not exactly be

370
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,959
representative of

371
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,159
an entire batch

372
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,159
um

373
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,120
yeah issue as well

374
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,360
yeah

375
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,320
yeah i mean there's really no way of

376
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,199
knowing

377
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,120
um that what you're buying is what was

378
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,039
tested for

379
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,198
anything that's not in these state

380
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,679
regulated

381
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:35,679
areas

382
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,679
and another thing that you mentioned

383
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,160
when i asked how common it was for

384
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,879
consumers to actually contact you to

385
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:48,000
verify results of a coa you said it was

386
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,000
more common now with delta eight thc yet

387
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
i know that coas have been in place for

388
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,159
cbd products um you know in the past so

389
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,278
what is it about the delta eight thc

390
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,278
products that are causing more red flags

391
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,958
i guess

392
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,480
um

393
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,799
i would imagine it is because of the

394
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
mild psychoactive properties

395
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,799
so

396
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,759
say you bought cbd and

397
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,278
um

398
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,759
cbd gummies

399
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,439
you may not necessarily get high you may

400
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,639
have some feeling but probably nothing

401
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
that's concerning

402
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,919
i think what happened with delta eight

403
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,919
is um you know it's very new so people

404
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,039
don't know how to dose um

405
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,278
it's

406
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,480
very new on the manufacturing end so you

407
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,559
also might be getting something that you

408
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,879
weren't expecting so if people are

409
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,439
having a psychiatric reaction that they

410
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:44,000
didn't expect uh that is more cause for

411
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,720
concern of like what did i just take you

412
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,159
know like let me dig into this and

413
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,720
unfortunately a lot of the times the

414
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:55,799
calls that we get are after the fact not

415
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,800
before so after they've consumed it

416
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,120
and so how often are those inquiries do

417
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,039
they

418
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,560
does it come up that

419
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,919
they may have

420
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,078
used a product that had a fake coa or

421
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,078
one that's been modified is it is it

422
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,359
increasingly common

423
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,758
um

424
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,639
i can't say increasingly and

425
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,199
even for the common um for the number of

426
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,560
calls that we get it it actually hasn't

427
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:21,679
been as common

428
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,479
okay um

429
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,958
but at the same time um

430
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,440
i also don't know how many people

431
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,879
go to that extent you know someone may

432
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,600
buy product

433
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:36,399
look up the report find it and think

434
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
okay this looks fine um so there could

435
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,679
be a lot out there that we just don't

436
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,839
know about

437
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,239
right but like you said you

438
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,959
you encourage people to reach out to you

439
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,320
um to confirm that these results or is

440
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,198
it is it becoming overwhelming

441
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,720
uh

442
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,799
you know on some days

443
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,879
we do get a good amount of calls but we

444
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,719
definitely do not want to cut that off

445
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,600
you know we're

446
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,920
we are a cannabis testing lab we're not

447
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,798
just gonna hide behind our results we're

448
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,038
going to

449
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,038
help

450
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,720
absolutely and

451
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
i guess to that end

452
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,600
are there any red flags or maybe warning

453
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,759
signs that people if they're if they are

454
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,240
looking into a coa for a product that

455
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,879
they had a maybe a strange or unexpected

456
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,240
experience with are there some some

457
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,720
indicators they can be looking for

458
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,000
yeah um this is a bit of a tough

459
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,200
question because uh to the trained eye

460
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,919
like uh

461
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,960
me and our staff we can quickly tell

462
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,919
what's what um

463
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
i guess

464
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,559
the

465
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,840
main points that i want to pass on is

466
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:51,038
most coas have pictures of products

467
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:53,439
so if you pull up a coa and the product

468
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,919
that you have in hand does not match

469
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,120
what is on the report that is a huge red

470
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,559
flag

471
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,319
already they're just

472
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,678
slapping on a qr code to a different

473
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,839
product assuming that you're not gonna

474
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,600
go to the extent of scanning it

475
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,439
um

476
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,079
even on the pictures

477
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,960
we we take the pictures in our lab

478
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,839
um

479
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,720
we take some nice pictures

480
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,720
don't expect a like a marketing

481
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,679
photograph to end up on a report that

482
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,919
comes from our lab you know if it has a

483
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,400
fancy background that's

484
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,160
that's going to be a red flag

485
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,610
we take very simple pictures

486
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,240
um

487
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,399
[Music]

488
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,200
i mentioned qr code so

489
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,360
qr codes are not only on products but we

490
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,519
also put qr codes on our reports and a

491
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,399
lot of other labs do as well

492
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,679
and

493
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,679
um this helps a lot because if you scan

494
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,280
the qr code on the report it actually

495
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,720
takes you to

496
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,759
the website that we use to host our

497
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,600
reports

498
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,160
so if

499
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,519
you're pulling up a report if you're

500
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,679
just getting a qr code and it's taking

501
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,440
you to some random website that doesn't

502
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,440
pair up to what is on the report that

503
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,679
could be a red flag as well because that

504
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,600
means they've probably downloaded it

505
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,679
possibly changed something uploaded it

506
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,399
elsewhere because they can't upload

507
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,798
anything to our site it's only

508
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,160
what we upload ourselves

509
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,879
um

510
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
if it is missing a qr code

511
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,360
that

512
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,879
could be red flag as well depending on

513
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,959
where it's coming from um but other than

514
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,880
that it's a lot of kind of minuscule

515
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,519
differences that would be

516
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,000
more so caught by us than anyone else

517
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,720
no but the one with the fact that the

518
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,599
report is most likely going to be hosted

519
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,240
on

520
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,558
the lab's website that

521
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,798
that i think is is a pretty good

522
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,558
indicator right there so if

523
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,279
if it's a pdf uploaded to the

524
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,359
manufacturer's website that's probably a

525
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,759
little more concerning than if it's

526
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,959
going to

527
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,759
encorelabs.com correct

528
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,919
it may or may not be um some some do

529
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,558
download it and and re-upload it very

530
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,679
directly without changing everything but

531
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,759
let's say

532
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,600
they uh they did do that and you scan

533
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,919
the qr code as long as it still goes

534
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,158
back to our hosted website um

535
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,679
that that would be fine and as long as

536
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,360
the one that you're looking at on their

537
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,000
website isn't any different than the one

538
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,038
that's on our website that would be fine

539
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,279
um

540
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,960
we do we use a lymph system that's

541
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,359
called confident cannabis and here in

542
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,519
california actually across the

543
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,959
nation a good amount of labs use that

544
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,038
website as well so that's a common one

545
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,880
that you would see reports on

546
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,759
excellent excellent

547
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,600
okay so i want to talk a bit about delta

548
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,558
t8 delta 8 thc specifically too because

549
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,079
you did

550
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,038
mention that

551
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,599
you know folks are still not

552
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,879
really familiar with how

553
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,879
these products are manufactured and how

554
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,799
kind of the differences in how they're

555
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,240
manufactured could introduce other

556
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,240
concerns

557
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,319
i was wondering if you could start maybe

558
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,720
briefly explaining what the process is

559
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,480
for creating these products and then you

560
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,279
can go from there

561
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
yeah uh i don't have hands-on experience

562
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,000
with this part more so just on the

563
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,840
testing

564
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
but just kind of very briefly

565
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,119
um

566
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,519
they're not extracting it from the hemp

567
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,439
plant there's not enough delta eight

568
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,759
naturally occurring in the hemp plant to

569
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,480
do that extraction like would be normal

570
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,720
for

571
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,759
cbd or thc

572
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,440
um what is actually being done is

573
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:33,679
uh cbd isolate which has had an

574
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,000
overstock because of the the hemp

575
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,798
legalization they're taking the cbd

576
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,839
isolate and they're introducing a

577
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,569
catalyst so a lot of the times it's a

578
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,879
combination of acid

579
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,558
[Music]

580
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,240
solvents and heat

581
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:49,359
and they are

582
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,038
converting

583
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:56,158
cbd into delta eight thc

584
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,798
uh so it's it's a it's an isomerization

585
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,360
process it's a conversion it's not an

586
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:01,359
extraction

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,640
right

588
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,479
um

589
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,600
and so i guess

590
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,640
in general how do sort of delta eight

591
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,879
thc products compare to the more

592
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,280
dispensary grade products that you test

593
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,679
in your lab i mean i i know i saw one

594
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,319
article recently out there and someone

595
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,798
was calling some of these delta ap thc

596
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,200
products bathroom gin

597
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,240
um is that is that something that you're

598
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,080
seeing

599
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,440
how do they compare to to things that

600
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,480
are coming from the regulated market

601
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
uh

602
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,360
you know unfortunately because

603
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,400
they don't have all of the required

604
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,359
testing

605
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,720
we don't have as much data points so a

606
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,719
lot of it is

607
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,720
kind of ignorance is bliss you know they

608
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,079
may have solvents but since they're not

609
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,679
required to do all this testing we don't

610
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:55,678
have those data points

611
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:58,798
um in in terms of cannabinoid potency

612
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,000
we have some pretty consistent products

613
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,279
that we see

614
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,798
with

615
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,119
90 plus

616
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,720
uh potency so

617
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,399
what i mean if i say

618
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,679
to say by that is uh

619
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,840
if we have a an oil that is coming from

620
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,080
a delta eight cartridge we're seeing

621
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,399
that it has uh

622
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,759
greater than ninety percent of only

623
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,240
delta eight thc in there which is pretty

624
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,919
comparable to some of the the delta nine

625
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,839
thc products

626
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,600
um

627
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,918
we see

628
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,319
a good amount of gummies and a good

629
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,919
amount are hitting the targets that are

630
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,599
labeled and

631
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,679
you know visibly

632
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,079
gummy looks like a gummy

633
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,600
overall um

634
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,278
but

635
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,798
i think what's really difficult for for

636
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:47,759
the consumer

637
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,119
is

638
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:55,200
that delta eight thcs is

639
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:57,278
as a primary cannabinoid is is new uh so

640
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
the effects are different the effects

641
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,159
are different from person to person

642
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,278
um

643
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,640
that is something that

644
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,558
needs to be

645
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,200
studied more

646
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,519
absolutely and

647
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,919
yeah i i just keep coming back to the

648
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,240
just the process of synthesizing delta a

649
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,880
thc and how that can just introduce all

650
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,519
these other you know residual stall

651
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
solvents or other compounds that you

652
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,639
wouldn't traditionally see if you were

653
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,719
doing just a straight extraction of

654
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,400
sort of naturally occurring

655
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,759
compounds in the plant

656
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,798
and it sounds like a lot of these

657
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,558
manufacturers aren't even going as far

658
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,119
as what's

659
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,839
what's commonly performed on

660
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,479
products in california to maybe even

661
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:48,000
capture those additional compounds that

662
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,240
come with the the process of

663
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,759
creating delta 8 thc so that's a that's

664
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,839
a little concerning

665
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,158
it is yeah and another key point to make

666
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,240
on that is the testing that we perform

667
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,200
is based on the california regulations

668
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,038
which were based on the knowledge of

669
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,240
historical

670
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:08,640
thc manufacturing so so these lists that

671
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,319
they create especially for like solvents

672
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,799
you know we're looking for butane and

673
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:16,558
that's a very common extraction solvent

674
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:18,158
but what is common for for delta 8 thc

675
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,879
is kind of still being figured out

676
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,440
there's a lot of different extraction

677
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,840
methods that are being tested so even if

678
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,278
we test for residual solvents with that

679
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,199
california list

680
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,000
it's not going to encompass

681
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
all

682
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,599
of the potential solvents that they

683
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,599
could use all right

684
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,599
yeah i just

685
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,839
the whole delta athc thing really

686
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,319
concerns me just because i feel like

687
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,599
that there's so many

688
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,319
so many great

689
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,719
growers manufacturers in the regulated

690
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,639
space that have all these regulatory

691
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,720
hoops that they need to jump through and

692
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,200
are doing things the right way

693
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,278
and you know have gained a lot of trust

694
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,600
in the marketplace for people to to

695
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,079
trust cannabis products

696
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,918
and now we have this new compound that's

697
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,439
coming out it's

698
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,640
unregulated

699
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,080
folks aren't

700
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,600
not testing for the things that they

701
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,439
should and i worry that they're

702
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,359
going to sort of erode the public trust

703
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,720
a little bit with cannabis products

704
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,079
because

705
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,079
they're not doing things the right way

706
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,840
yeah i would definitely agree with all

707
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,679
that it's it's not to say that there

708
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,439
aren't um

709
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,840
companies that have good manufacturing

710
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,400
practices and that are doing a good

711
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,158
amount of testing and have transparency

712
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,480
but there's a lot of bad actors that are

713
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,039
completely taking advantage of of this

714
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,558
uh seemingly gray area you know that is

715
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,400
up for interpretation

716
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,960
but um

717
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,080
yeah i mean a couple states have already

718
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,679
taken action outlawed and and we'll kind

719
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,918
of have to see what the

720
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,600
continuing regulatory landscape turns

721
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,880
into for this but

722
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,038
um

723
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,760
i guess another thing to worry about is

724
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:02,079
even if delta 8 becomes outlawed or

725
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,558
included in regulatory schemes who's to

726
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,480
say that the next cannabinoid isn't

727
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:10,000
going to become the next trend you know

728
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,200
right delta 10 thc sure so

729
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,400
we'll really have to see how this

730
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,798
evolves but i mean on our end the main

731
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,798
thing is

732
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:24,158
for consumers is continue to ask about

733
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,678
testing uh from the manufacturers

734
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,360
continue to push for that because if

735
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,159
there's no regulatory push then it has

736
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,000
to come from the consumers

737
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,520
yeah agreed um

738
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,759
and yeah i think it's unfortunate that

739
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,319
some states have taken to to banning

740
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,720
delta a thc instead of what you

741
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:44,558
suggested you know maybe sort of

742
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,880
bundling it in or including it with um

743
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,480
with the with the legal market and kind

744
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,399
of letting sort of things like we've

745
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,599
said these established

746
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:55,599
um operators who are operating within

747
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,678
the regulated market making sure that

748
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,240
you know they're

749
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,240
maybe the ones that are that are

750
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,399
bringing these delta athc products to

751
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,240
market instead of these new actors who

752
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,759
may be just um

753
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,278
sort of trying to make a buck no and

754
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,960
like you said not to say that there

755
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,038
aren't some good ones out there but it

756
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,079
seems yeah at least it seems to me as a

757
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,319
consumer

758
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,079
a potential consumer it's hard for me to

759
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,678
be able to suss out who are the good and

760
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,720
the bad actors if if folks are sort of

761
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,360
um

762
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,000
doing what they're doing with the coas

763
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,199
yeah definitely

764
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,839
yeah

765
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,919
um and yeah so just in general with with

766
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,599
delta hchc testing how much has that

767
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,120
grown in the past 12 months because it

768
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,439
seems like it's really exploded as

769
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,719
as a recently

770
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,558
yeah it has um it definitely

771
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,839
hasn't taken over a majority of our

772
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:52,558
testing we really still focus on on our

773
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,759
compliance testing and uh supporting r d

774
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,480
testing that that supports that

775
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,640
compliance testing but um

776
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,120
you know a year ago if you asked us

777
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,759
about delta 8 thc it was

778
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,359
it was a minor cannabinoid that

779
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,519
occasionally came up

780
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:11,359
because uh someone didn't treat their

781
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:14,398
their normal thc distillate well uh but

782
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,240
now you know we're seeing a good variety

783
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,879
of products come through

784
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,720
that are solely for for delta eight and

785
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:26,640
um you know some days we we see 10 to 15

786
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,278
of our r d testing is solely from delta

787
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
a

788
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,398
wow

789
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,600
wow yeah and so maybe this is a good

790
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,678
point i know we're coming up to the end

791
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,319
of it um maybe if you could tell us a

792
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,679
bit about encore labs what you guys do

793
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,798
and

794
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:44,480
how people can learn more about you guys

795
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,519
yeah so um we are a

796
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,720
licensed

797
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,079
cannabis testing lab here in california

798
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,679
[Music]

799
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,199
different states obviously have

800
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,559
different

801
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,880
regulations if it has become legalized

802
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:01,440
so in california you have to be licensed

803
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,240
to test for these compliance tests uh we

804
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,240
are iso accredited as well so that's

805
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,240
kind of a big thing for us and to

806
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,640
educate the consumers on the differences

807
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,159
between iso credit labs and non-iso

808
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,640
accredited labs

809
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,559
we have to go through an accreditation

810
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,360
process

811
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:23,119
that encompasses a huge list of

812
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,839
requirements

813
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,759
and we have met that

814
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,678
so if you're looking at a coa that's

815
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,640
actually another thing to look for are

816
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,038
the testing labs being used iso credited

817
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,120
are they licensed by your state

818
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,398
if they're not then there could be more

819
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,759
questions on the lab producing the

820
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:40,879
results

821
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,599
um

822
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
so

823
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,519
we are

824
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,399
located in pasadena california and we

825
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,599
feel like we have a very uh strategic

826
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:50,479
location

827
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,678
for

828
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,679
the

829
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,060
cannabis landscape

830
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,200
um

831
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,678
[Music]

832
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,038
we've been here since 2018 and have

833
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,080
really grown

834
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,278
with our experience and with our team

835
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,038
and

836
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,679
we're always looking for opportunities

837
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,599
to educate consumers and um to partner

838
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,038
up with different companies to

839
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,038
to push for testing

840
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,278
absolutely and you're located in

841
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,880
pasadena california which is where i

842
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,278
came at conferences

843
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,880
so that's um it's great that we're very

844
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,480
happy to have you guys on board as a

845
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,760
bronze sponsor

846
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,880
and um

847
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,558
i think if you're looking to partner

848
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,080
with companies that are looking to to

849
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,599
educate you you've come to the right

850
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,839
place

851
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,879
yeah

852
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:36,480
