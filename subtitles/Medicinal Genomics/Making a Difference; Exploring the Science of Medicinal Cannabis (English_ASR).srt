3
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,750
when we started working on cannabinoids

4
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:58,210
which was many many many years ago in

5
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:03,100
the 60s we isolated quite a large number

6
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:05,228
of compounds in in hashish which is the

7
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,659
resin of cannabis and of course there

8
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:09,099
was a cannabidiol the major compound we

9
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,989
looked in collaboration with many

10
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,849
friends that the activity of some of

11
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:15,369
these compounds but we still don't know

12
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:17,679
much about them for example there is a

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,500
compound which we called canopy Jarrow

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,450
we know very little about it it seems to

15
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,700
have anti-cancer properties but it has

16
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,728
to be looked into in much more an

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,868
underbite has never been given to a

18
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:36,640
human so we don't know what it does

19
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:39,159
when administered to a human which is

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,090
again a strange situation we know that

21
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,519
it's not toxic we know that it it is

22
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,759
formed in the body when needed and

23
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:52,090
immediately broken down nobody has seen

24
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,640
any major side effects in animals and

25
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,679
yet it has never been administered to a

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,710
human although it was discovered by us

27
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:02,500
in 1990 to compare this to what happened

28
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:06,759
with insulin when insulin was discovered

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,280
in the body in the 20s in Canada within

30
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,189
six months it became a drug it was given

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,280
to a few patients after they found it is

32
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:17,800
not toxic given to a few patients

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,280
insulin was found to lower diabetes and

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:26,010
it became a drug excellent red still

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,750
widely used we synthesized new compounds

36
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:32,379
which are much more active than

37
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,409
cannabidiol so we are developing them

38
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:37,780
and hopefully they can become the new

39
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:39,579
drugs the moment we have more practical

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,568
things looking at endogenous

41
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:47,680
cannabinoids like compounds which seem

42
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:50,318
to be of major importance basically what

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,280
I'm doing at the moment is collaborate

44
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:56,649
with a huge number of people and we do

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,408
the chemistry so there is

46
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,349
think that we can start initiate we do

47
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:04,658
the chemistry my collaborators do the

48
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:07,389
biology in different fields and together

49
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:10,030
we come up with a with something that

50
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:15,250
hopefully contributes we do a lot of

51
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:18,098
research and it involves investment in

52
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:22,299
in the people that they do the work in

53
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:24,158
my lab I have a small group with two or

54
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:26,170
three people working part-time you have

55
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,259
to find money to support the lab and

56
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:32,488
support the people that work in the lab

57
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:33,639
there's two basic things that have to be

58
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,370
learned

59
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,259
strangely enough still after so many

60
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,539
years we don't know enough about the

61
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:43,870
compounds the activity of the compounds

62
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:46,298
in the plant itself very strange but

63
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,750
that's where we are we know a lot about

64
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,489
THC we know a lot of CBD but we know

65
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,120
very little about some of the other

66
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,120
compounds

67
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,000
