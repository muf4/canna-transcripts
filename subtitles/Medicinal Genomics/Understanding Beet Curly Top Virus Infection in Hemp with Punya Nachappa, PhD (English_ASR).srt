00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,318
identified several different viruses in

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,719
colorado hemp samples most notably beet

110
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,719
curly top virus which is a pathogen

111
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,000
known to infect several different plant

112
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,239
species

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,639
in our conversation we discuss the

114
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,399
prevalence of beet curly top virus in

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,560
colorado hemp

116
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:31,839
how bctv compares to hop latent viroid

117
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,519
the bctv disease progression in hemp in

118
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,000
cannabis plants

119
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,439
we also talk at length about the only

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,040
known mode of transmission for bctv the

121
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,879
beet leaf hopper

122
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,000
we also get into strategies for

123
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,560
preventing bctv in keeping leaf hoppers

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
away and finally we discuss other

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
viruses and viroids cannabis and hemp

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
growers should be aware of

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,479
growers that's viruses

160

161
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,360
you and your team have published a paper

162
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,160
in december that examined symptomatic

163
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,280
hemp leaf samples from colorado for beat

164
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,120
curly top virus which might be a virus

165
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,359
that listeners might not be familiar

166
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,959
with but before we get into that tell us

167

dr whitney crenshaw who had done most of

172
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,120
the work

173
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,478
on

174
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,598
characterizing pests complex complex

175
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,318
insect pests on hemp had um you know

176
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,879
alerted me to these virus-looking hemp

177
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,800
plants um in the field

178
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,120
um of course we didn't know anything at

179
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,120
that time it looked like you know very

180
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,038
typical yellowing and stunting um

181
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,000
symptoms and i was planning to go take a

182
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,639
look at it in the 2019 field season

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,360
but before i could do it myself we had

184
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,319
growers reaching out to my lab and the

185
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,479
plant diagnostic clinic here at csu it

186
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,639
was just an outbreak so of course we

187
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,360
went out uh dr whitney cranshaw came out

188
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,918
with us and it was incredible

189
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,479
the range of symptoms uh which i

190
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:48,079
published some of it in a short review

191
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:50,399
in outlooks and pest management

192
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,680
and the high level of incidents like you

193
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,478
mentioned 81 percent uh incidence is

194
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,160
just staggering uh you know in this new

195
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,240
crop

196
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,439
so it's pretty spectacular and spread

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,120
across

198
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,839
you know the western slope where we grow

199
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,079
most of the hemp here in colorado and

200
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,279
the northeastern area as well so pretty

201
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,399
widespread

202
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,119
and

203
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,439
my student who led that work judah

204
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,038
chiginsky we we continued to survey in

205
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,800
2020

206
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,199
uh because the initial survey was in

207
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,520
2019 and 2020 it was limited because we

208
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,639
had another virus disrupting our lives

209
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,198
coveted

210
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,639
still we found in the limited survey we

211
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,439
found close to 100 percent bctv in hemp

212
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,440
wow

213
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,479
and then but last year i have some good

214
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,919
news for my growers um only only around

215
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,719
20

216
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,718
we think it was um it was very dry and

217
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,680
there was hardly anything green many

218
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,240
hemp growers didn't even grow much hemp

219
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,199
and the lack of you know green

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,600
vegetation may may have been one reason

221
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,480
for a lower incidence so it's been up

222
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,480
and down uh but it's definitely

223
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,159
you know it's this disease this virus

224
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,879
has been around for over hundreds of

225
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,919
years and other crop species so it's

226
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,958
definitely to show up in hemp again

227
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,240
so that percentage of um

228
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,399
of prevalence that you're finding with b

229
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,120
curly top virus now is that in

230
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,839
symptomatic leaves only or is that in

231
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,399
asymptomatic plants as well very good

232
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,480
question so you know in 2019 the work we

233
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,039
published in the paper was very targeted

234
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,800
so it was just the symptomatic plants

235
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,079
and like i said even that was

236
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,838
questionable because we'd seen such

237
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,000
range of symptoms

238
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,560
from curling to

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,958
something that we fondly call taco leaf

240
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,119
the leaf had completely curled up like

241
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,439
like a taco would all of them tested

242
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,839
positive for bctv so only in symptomatic

243
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,240
plants but currently we are having an

244
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,959
experiment in our greenhouse we're

245
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,200
working with this hemp genetics

246
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,759
developing company here in fort collins

247
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,720
new west genetics and we're screening

248
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,278
some of their lines and um some of them

249
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,800
are asymptomatic but test positive for

250
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,559
bctv uh using pcr

251
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,439
wow

252
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,359
and then

253
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,519
sorry go ahead please go ahead no i was

254
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,320
gonna say you know and then you've seen

255
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,879
our paper we we've had so many different

256
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,680
viruses in there right um and some of

257
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:21,200
them were healthy in fact the the sample

258
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:24,479
from larimer county uh that had um

259
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,160
cannabis cryptic virus was

260
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,320
healthy and beautiful as ever so

261
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,639
we really don't know the impact of these

262
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,560
viruses and the one viroid which is also

263
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,439
pretty important yeah i know that

264
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,119
cannabis cryptic virus it's no

265
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,079
it's no wonder why they call it cannabis

266
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,078
cryptic right it's uh

267
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,039
yes

268
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,639
yeah and i was gonna ask you about other

269
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,799
viruses too because you know i had

270
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,199
mentioned that it's viruses are becoming

271
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,679
more top of mind for hemp and cannabis

272
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
growers but the one that's that gets all

273
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,919
the publicity or gets all the notoriety

274
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,000
is is actually the viroid hoplite

275
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,399
thyroid so i wonder how does b curly top

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
virus differ from hot plate and viroid

277
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,919
how are they the same could there be

278
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,399
some sort of

279
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,838
um a case of misidentification people

280
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,240
thinking they have hoplite and thyroid

281
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,160
they actually have beet curly top um

282
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,360
your thoughts on that

283
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,838
so um

284
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,879
what's in we i'm just going to initiate

285
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,000
an um hop latent viroid project to do a

286
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,480
like you said you know better

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,679
characterization of it to help growers

288
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,920
but as the name suggests it's latent

289
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:35,519
right so it's dormant in the plant and

290
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:38,240
can go asymptomatic for uh you know

291
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,639
weeks to months is is my understanding

292
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,560
but then it causes the so-called duding

293
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,639
at least that's what the growers call it

294
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,879
where the flowers just don't flower and

295
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,559
are completely um

296
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,399
you know destroyed

297
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:54,638
um we haven't seen so in you know um we

298
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,480
detected hot plate and viroid in our

299
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,959
samples from two counties

300
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,600
and those samples predominantly had bct

301
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:04,159
symptoms had you know and coincidentally

302
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,240
they were infected um

303
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,559
with the hoplite and viroid or may it's

304
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
possible that the samples came from a

305
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,239
different plant and uh

306
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,479
because we had pooled samples you know

307
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,320
from from different plants in our um

308
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,759
sequencing so

309
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
um

310
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,759
i haven't first hand seen it but in

311
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,480
talking with a colleague in um

312
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,559
simon fraser university in canada

313
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,639
uh dr zameer punja who is a very well

314
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,359
known hemp a plant pathologist he was

315
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,360
telling us how predominant and prevalent

316
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,200
it is in canada with i think he

317
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
mentioned something like 70 or 80

318
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,278
percent

319
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,879
of um the cannabis uh being infected

320
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,240
with hot plate and vitroid in a study

321
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,120
that he had done

322
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,200
um you know so pretty staggering

323
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,639
how how it is so you know that's what

324
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,800
i'm that's the big difference between

325
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,159
bctv and hot plate and viral oil to me

326
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:59,199
but hoplite and viroi unlike bctv can be

327
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,919
transmitted mechanically right so you

328
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,759
touch an infected plant and then

329
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,240
and you have no idea that it's infected

330
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,120
because it's presumably asymptomatic and

331
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
you

332
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,480
handle a healthy plant and it gets

333
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,000
transmitted now with pctv

334
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,079
fortunately

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,799
we only there's only one mode of

336
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,278
transmission that's the beet leaf hopper

337
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,199
no other species of leaf hopper can even

338
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,159
transmit it to our knowledge

339
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,560
yeah it is it's it's just such a tight

340
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,759
evolutionary relationship just one

341
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,439
species and i work with aphids that

342
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,439
transmit viruses

343
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,519
like this potato virus y and there are

344
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,279
over 60 species of aphids that can

345
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,240
transmit the virus

346
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,838
but with bctv just the one so

347
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,759
that's really cool

348
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,760
and as far as we know it's not c

349
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,439
transmitted pctv

350
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,278
the cloud we're confirming that in our

351
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,160
lab because some growers

352
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,720
um

353
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,879
have that concern hemp growers

354
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,360
so that's the big difference right in in

355
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,439
some ways i think hot plate and viroid

356
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,399
because of the mechanical transmission

357
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,839
is you know spreading more rampantly in

358
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,120
fact we just got a

359
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,560
sample from a

360
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,879
colleague in

361
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,078
california

362
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,480
that

363
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,799
outwardly looked like bctv but tested

364
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,879
positive for both bc tv and hot plate

365
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,639
and viroid so you have this mix

366
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,000
infection and who knows what kind of

367
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,480
synergism or antagonism you know

368
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,399
multiple infections can have

369
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,399
yeah no that's a great point about hot

370
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,639
plate and viroid and sort of the unique

371
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,399
challenges that that raises another

372
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,799
thing to consider too is just you know

373
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,799
the clonal propagation of cannabis in

374
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,399
hemp as well right if you're if you're

375
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,359
taking a cutting from a plant that you

376
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,159
presume

377
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,879
yeah

378
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,679
is

379
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,639
not infected now you're handing a a bomb

380
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,399
to your

381
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,839
uh your colleague or your friend that's

382
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,600
going to be right

383
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,600
right exactly and

384
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,079
yeah and then who knows yeah the impact

385
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,440
on uh yeah

386
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:01,679
with you know crust uh prostate across

387
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,040
country movement and introducing these

388
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,278
pathogens

389
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,559
because it's not very well defined yet

390
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,600
as yet

391
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,919
you know seed certification or cuttings

392
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,519
right yeah or you know certified clones

393
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,559
too that are yeah

394
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,159
i mean

395
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,879
i know we ourselves in medicinal

396
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,719
genomics we're trying to develop pcr

397
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,720
assays to help people screen and do

398
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,120
things like that um so maybe eventually

399
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,560
we'll get there but um yeah it's still

400
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,120
very um

401
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,399
very early in that process so i want to

402
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,639
come back to the leaf hoppers because

403
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,958
that is really interesting i didn't

404
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,959
realize i i read in the paper that it

405
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,239
was you know the primary source of

406
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,039
infection but i didn't know that it was

407
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,799
the only source so

408
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,759
um

409
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,879
i'm curious more sort of about that is

410
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,800
it

411
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,078
how does that synergistic relationship

412
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,758
work

413
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,198
oh that's a great question so as i

414
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,519
mentioned you know the virus and the

415
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,479
vector um

416
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,959
the virus is only able to um you know

417
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,680
infect a plant via the beet leaf hopper

418
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,000
this one vector circular tenalis

419
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:09,120
and then and that's my training i'm an

420
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,879
entomologist by training so in these

421
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,679
fields in these hemp fields like you can

422
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,480
see in my background when we go over we

423
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,239
we use insect nests to sweep and there

424
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
we found around eight to ten different

425
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,480
species of leaf hoppers

426
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,959
and we tested each and every one of them

427
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,680
and only circular for tennelis

428
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,000
was positive for this exact same strains

429
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,799
that we were detecting in um

430
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,639
in our hemp sample so uh to date no one

431
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,679
has shown any other more means of

432
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,879
transmission of bctv there was one study

433
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:43,519
uh from iran i believe showing obesity

434
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,320
was seed transmitted in petunia but not

435
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,720
in

436
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,120
and it was very low uh transmission rate

437
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,360
but not in sugar beets or tomatoes some

438
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
of the other major crops that bctv

439
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,120
infects

440
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,518
so the the insect

441
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,759
picks up the virus from an infected

442
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,519
plant it's a phloem uh limited virus

443
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,160
right it's in the flow only in the floam

444
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,078
tissue of the of the plant so the insect

445
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
feeds on in the foam it's a foam feeding

446
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,159
insect sucks up the virus the virus

447
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,079
enters the insect gut

448
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,959
it does not replicate

449
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,279
uh as far as we know it just circulates

450
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,679
through the gut of the insects and then

451
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,519
comes and reinfects the salivary glands

452
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,079
of the insect and when the insect feeds

453
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,359
on a healthy plant usually they salivate

454
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,438
and that's when the

455
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,519
the virus particles of the virions come

456
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,000
out and infect the plant

457
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,240
now what's interesting is judith a

458
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
second part of her thesis my student

459
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,558
that led this work

460
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,240
she we're getting ready to publish

461
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,720
where we're showing that

462
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,319
virus infected insects actually have

463
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,759
better

464
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,519
reproduction better um life history

465
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,079
characteristics so you know when they

466
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,319
get infected they do better

467
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,319
um and able to proliferate more and

468
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,279
spread the virus more so the virus is

469
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,599
you know

470
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,440
uh manipulating vector performance and

471
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,959
this has been shown for other systems

472
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,000
but first time for bc tv

473
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,880
wow

474
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,319
so very intimate relationship yeah very

475
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,200
interesting

476
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,918
yeah that is interesting and

477
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,160
am i correct in maybe assuming that

478
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,480
the virus doesn't replicate via

479
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,840
mechanical transmission because

480
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,240
the the virus um you know is exposed to

481
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,079
the elements or whatever on the

482
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,000
instruments that you might be using and

483
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,038
it's not able to proliferate but then if

484
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,880
it's within the the gut of this leaf

485
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,879
hopper it's kind of more protected from

486
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,760
that is that safety now there are

487
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,080
viruses that do proliferate via

488
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,079
mechanical transmission you're right

489
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,960
like the most notorious one is tobacco

490
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,319
mosaic virus i mean that is um

491
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,360
so um

492
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,599
i'm not sure yeah there's you know how

493
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,279
that come this evolutionarily tight

494
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,000
relationship has come around with just

495
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,399
this one species of insect vector but

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,279
presumably you're right they are

497
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
um

498
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,960
you know

499
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,400
being um sort of um

500
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,798
protected

501
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,919
by the insect vector and then this

502
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,119
insect feeds on over 100 different plant

503
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,840
species

504
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,798
and able to transmit the virus to all of

505
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,480
these species now what's interesting is

506
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,440
we find that

507
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,360
the insects cannot reproduce on hemp

508
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,240
beet leaf hoppers

509
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,079
they can

510
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,558
and for that matter they don't do very

511
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,359
well on tomato or pepper the other major

512
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,480
hosts they can go maybe one generation

513
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,719
so the

514
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,360
females can produce one set of offspring

515
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,600
and then they just perish

516
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,639
so there's something um you know they're

517
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,519
not they haven't evolved with this um

518
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,160
plant uh potentially but

519
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,480
but they can they'd still do feed on the

520
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,759
plant and in in during that time it only

521
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,679
takes a couple of

522
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,440
hours for them minutes to hours to

523
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,200
transmit the virus

524
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,919
while they taste and they say oh i don't

525
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,840
like this too much this hosts too much

526
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,360
in the meantime they are transmitting

527
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,558
the virus

528
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:11,279
interesting so do the leaf hoppers not

529
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,599
particularly like the taste of of hemp

530
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,119
they don't feed on it as much they do

531
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,959
not in fact

532
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,719
more you know we

533
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,600
when we go looking for the leaf hoppers

534
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
in hemp we hardly find a handful but

535
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,839
then

536
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,600
in across in the surrounding fields we

537
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:31,199
or you know the ditches we see all these

538
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,199
weeds weed species

539
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,759
you know dandelion and kosher and

540
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,200
russian thistle that's where the leaf

541
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:43,200
hoppers are they really thrive on these

542
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,120
um bouquet of uh weed or buffet of

543
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,840
uh weed species and of course sugar

544
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,279
beets that's how we maintain them uh

545
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,279
in our lab

546
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,000
yeah that makes sense hence the name

547
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:53,119
right

548
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
yes

549
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,239
so

550
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,240
given the fact that it's just this

551
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,960
particular species of leaf hopper that's

552
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,759
spreading is this sort of a regional

553
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,960
issue and less of an issue with in other

554
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,960
areas

555
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,840
no not at all so in fact um leaf hoppers

556
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,600
don't even overwinter in colorado is

557
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,399
what we believe

558
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,879
it gets too cold for them we at least we

559
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,880
think uh uh some of our tracking work

560
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,760
has shown them that they

561
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,840
they are coming up from new mexico and

562
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,558
um arizona the population they

563
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,558
overwinter there and the more uh on weed

564
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,879
species again that it's more warmer

565
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,119
right than it is in colorado and once

566
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,480
those weeds dry down they are moving

567
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,839
northward so it's a huge problem

568
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,759
in

569
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,879
beet leaf hoppers and bctv is a huge

570
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:47,359
problem in peppers in new mexico

571
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,360
in arizona as well but most importantly

572
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,038
in california

573
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,359
bctv and

574
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,000
beetle hopper is a huge issue on

575
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,399
tomatoes and just devastated the tomato

576
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,798
industry you know some decades ago but

577
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,960
we have some tools and tomatoes

578
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:05,918
and i have talked to some researchers at

579
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,159
uc davis that have confirmed bc tv in

580
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,120
hemp they just haven't published it as

581
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,600
yet

582
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,879
yeah and i've also talked to some collab

583
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:17,678
some colleagues in oregon state

584
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,679
where again we have uh bc tv and beatles

585
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,159
and they've confirmed it in hemp as well

586
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,840
they just haven't uh published the work

587
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,080
so it's that at least you know

588
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,319
um western united states where most of

589
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,798
the hemp is grown it is

590
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,798
an issue

591
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,798
is it less of an issue in indoor

592
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,798
cultivation facilities

593
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,119
so that's what i'm trying to figure out

594
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:44,079
because one of the growers that that is

595
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,719
who is pretty convinced that it um it's

596
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:50,240
sea transmitted he thinks that he got it

597
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,640
in seeds uh not um clones

598
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,720
but i don't know if um a leaf hopper

599
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,038
came in and infected the plant or if the

600
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,360
bctv came in via the seeds you know it's

601
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:02,480
not 100 but even in our greenhouse

602
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:05,359
they're not hundred percent um you know

603
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,240
insect proof sure um they are pretty

604
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:11,199
they're bigger than something small like

605
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,079
mites or trips but um

606
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,038
i

607
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,038
definitely um be given that they like

608
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:20,000
like i mentioned you know this buffet of

609
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:23,759
um or a variety of plants they're more

610
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,599
likely to be an outdoor issue

611
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,879
and you mentioned i think it was when

612
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,959
you were talking about tomatoes that

613
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,240
there are some tools to sort of be

614
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,720
limiting the leaf hoppers um from

615
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,319
you know munching on the the crops so

616
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,640
what are some of the options for

617
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,399
preventing uh the curly top virus or

618
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,520
these leaf hoppers from infecting your

619
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,440
bro

620
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,038
so i'm so glad you asked that and in you

621
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,759
know um

622
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,679
given that like given that this virus is

623
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,519
only transmitted via via the hoppers

624
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,360
it's important for entomologists and

625
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:57,200
plant pathologists to work together

626
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,798
right but um and and this this is what's

627
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,759
helped the industry at least for

628
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:04,240
tomatoes um there are varieties and and

629
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,359
for sugar beets too there are varieties

630
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,960
that are resistant to the virus

631
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,038
um

632
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,400
they say it's between

633
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,240
low to moderate levels of resistance not

634
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,440
not extremely high

635
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,480
in

636
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,320
and tomatoes um they also use um

637
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
insecticidal sprays

638
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,798
yeah uh that you know but none of that

639
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,319
is an option for hemp growers in fact

640
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,480
and and that

641
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,879
that's okay but you know like i said it

642
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,200
only takes a few minutes two hours to

643
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,039
transmit the virus so timing is

644
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
important you know how are the growers

645
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,158
gonna know when the leaf hoppers are

646
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,240
coming in you know that's it's tricky so

647
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,159
what's worked for the sugar beet growers

648
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,839
because it's a huge problem in sugar

649
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,320
beets is uh systemic insecticides that

650
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:56,000
that's in the plant so you actually

651
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,200
in fact here in colorado and

652
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,519
our region

653
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,679
sugar beet growers have to buy

654
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,400
seeds sugar beet seeds that are coated

655
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,679
with a with the systemic insecticide so

656
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,080
when the plant

657
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,798
uh germinates the the

658
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,720
insecticide is in the plant

659
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,839
so that gives them the protection for

660
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,640
around

661
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,319
roughly around 50 to 55 days when the

662
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,159
first wave of the leaf hoppers are

663
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,599
coming in from the south and that

664
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,679
protects them but

665
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,240
none of that is an option for hemp

666
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,159
growers right in fact

667
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,400
that's where the issue is and my

668
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,760
collaborators from california the ones

669
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,480
that sent us that tissue we just

670
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:38,079
submitted a proposal trying to come up

671
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,079
with um management tactics for um hemp

672
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,119
growers

673
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,278
wow

674
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,879
and i wonder if we could talk a bit more

675
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,839
about sort of

676
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,159
once the plant is infected sort of

677
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,798
what's the timeline in terms of you know

678
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,120
how the disease progresses and does it

679
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,720
eventually kill the plant and just

680
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,038
totally wipe it out or is it more like a

681
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,519
hot blatant viroid situation where it's

682
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,480
just the yield and quality is greatly

683
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,798
reduced

684
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,200
you know that's such a good question so

685
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,558
like i mentioned our whole culture we've

686
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,400
got um cultures of beet leaf hoppers um

687
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,200
in the lab and we maintain them on sugar

688
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,798
beets and sugar beets just die in a

689
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,798
matter of um

690
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,839
a week to ten days because it's a

691
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,519
preferred host they just go you know i

692
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,359
wish you could come see our colony we

693
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,440
cannot keep up with

694
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,439
the pressure and how fast because of

695
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,519
course we're using a susceptible uh you

696
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,120
know line of sugar beets

697
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:37,759
now with hemp it's not that drastic

698
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:40,158
and i've gone to visit fields over weeks

699
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,000
and you can see the plant it still looks

700
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,159
pretty bad but not

701
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,240
dead yet and and that's one thing i tell

702
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,480
my growers you see an infected plant or

703
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,278
you suspect one that's looking infected

704
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,278
get rid of it so it doesn't serve as a

705
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:57,119
as a source so hemp lasts longer in fact

706
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,319
you know we're doing this um screening

707
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,439
right now

708
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,960
and um in several weeks months and the

709
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,880
plants look look

710
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,840
look diseased but not dead yet

711
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,960
eventually i i am sure they will

712
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:13,119
what we need to figure out and help and

713
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,679
its top priority for my lab is to see

714
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,278
how the virus affects cannabinoids and

715
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,080
the quality

716
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,640
yes

717
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:23,038
cbd but in particular

718
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,120
that needs to be done i um growers tell

719
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,839
me that the yield is reduced and the

720
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:30,719
flower quality is uh is poor

721
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,558
but we haven't had any actual evidence

722
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,440
of that

723
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:38,000
okay and and so i i heard you say there

724
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,880
so is the is the recommendation too if

725
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,839
you id if you identify an infected plant

726
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,360
just just pull it immediately

727
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,759
yes

728
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,479
definitely and then after my students

729
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:53,278
work we can tell the growers that two uh

730
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,720
dandelion and um

731
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:56,558
russian thistle

732
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,720
are top v you know there are some

733
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,200
specific weeds that they need to in fact

734
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,278
any weeds just get a surrounding hemp

735
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,240
you need to just get rid of it

736
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,079
yeah

737
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,000
yeah yeah i was going to ask about that

738
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,158
because you mentioned that you know

739
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,839
the leaf hoppers they don't prefer

740
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,559
hemp but you know they'll they'll take a

741
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,639
bite if they're kind of buffeting on

742
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,639
some other um

743
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,159
some other plants in the area so yeah i

744
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,200
was going to ask if it makes sense to

745
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,039
kind of make sure that there's a an air

746
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,480
that you clear the area around your grow

747
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,359
to kind of prevent that

748
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,038
totally yes definitely yeah

749
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,719
that's a that's a great idea too and

750
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,879
then another thing we do and you can see

751
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,200
in the in my background i don't know if

752
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,840
you can see very closely you know

753
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,120
growers use mulches plastic mulch is

754
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,678
right for

755
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,519
mainly for weed control

756
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,159
but there are some mulches research has

757
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,879
been done with aphids and other insects

758
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,080
there are some reflective mulches that

759
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,080
um you know

760
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,639
reflect light off and that prevents the

761
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:59,038
insects from landing on the plants so

762
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,120
we're trying to test that to see if

763
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,960
maybe growers could just switch it use a

764
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,759
different kind of mulch

765
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,679
uh that could then um

766
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,158
you know act as

767
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,720
weed control and also confer um other

768
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,760
benefits like reduce the pest landing

769
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,319
especially

770
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,679
leaf hoppers so some small easy things

771
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,918
that they can do

772
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,200
um to reduce

773
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,480
uh you know

774
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,679
infection

775
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,319
yeah

776
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,798
you know and i know that there are some

777
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:31,038
folks who with other viruses

778
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,000
are attempting tissue culture as a way

779
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:33,038
to

780
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,759
um

781
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,359
produce a new virus free variety has

782
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,119
that been attempted with anything that's

783
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,278
been affected with the curly top virus

784
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,439
is that not an option

785
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,319
so um we do have a tissue culture lab

786
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,720
here at csu and and we're trying and

787
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,519
i've given her you know our primer some

788
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,798
of our leaf tissue and rna samples

789
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,720
to develop

790
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,679
some diagnostic tools so then she can

791
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,120
test uh these tissue cultured plants but

792
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,360
i think it's very much in um you know

793
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:06,319
early stages not anything ready for

794
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,319
commercial um

795
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,840
you know

796
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,919
not commercially available but pretty

797
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,398
much once a month like just last couple

798
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,640
of days ago i got an email from

799
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,558
a diagnostic company one you know

800
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,080
wanting samples

801
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,798
um

802
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,278
from our study to develop diagnostic

803
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,918
tools but the issue is not all states

804
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,839
are allowed you know can work even on

805
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,440
hemp for that matter never mind

806
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,839
marijuana

807
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,558
yeah that is definitely um a challenge

808
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,079
that we need to navigate as we yes as we

809
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:38,798
explore these plants

810
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,079
so

811
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,158
i was wondering

812
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,720
i know that you identified other viruses

813
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,278
and viroids um in some of these samples

814
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,960
in your paper um

815
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,798
anything interesting there that you know

816
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,319
growers should be aware of or that maybe

817
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,158
you and your team are going to be uh

818
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,278
investigating the in the years to come

819
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,880
here

820
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,038
that's a great question you know my

821
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,840
department head uh

822
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,519
dr amy charkowski she told me one you

823
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:05,199
know when i was telling her about all

824
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,960
the viruses we found he's like you have

825
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,759
your carrier here you can just keep

826
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,480
studying this right and that's

827
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,640
and that'll that'll do it uh so yes of

828
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,640
course hot plate and viroid and um

829
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,759
there's a grower coming being bringing

830
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,919
me some

831
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,319
samples some plants infected so we can

832
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,919
figure this out and and actually there's

833
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,200
one report of

834
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,038
hop aphid transmitting hopleton viroid

835
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,519
so i want to look into aphid

836
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,200
transmission the other one that i i

837
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,399
think was particularly interesting in

838
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,480
our virum analysis is was a tobacco

839
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:39,918
streak virus

840
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,679
um

841
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,880
the reason it's interesting is because

842
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,679
it it has a worldwide distribution it

843
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,399
goes to it in fact several species and

844
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,679
trips transmitted and you know any any

845
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:56,398
grower in doing any kind of um you know

846
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,278
agriculture is where are familiar with

847
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,599
trips

848
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:02,079
highly ubiquitous several species of

849
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,278
trips transmitted and what's interesting

850
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,918
is our

851
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:08,880
sequences indicate that it's a new

852
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,919
genotype of virus or a new

853
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,880
isolate of this tobacco strict virus in

854
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,960
hemp

855
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,278
interesting so you know so

856
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,360
that makes it all the more

857
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,640
challenging

858
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,038
um

859
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,799
and tobacco stick wise goes to peppers

860
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,720
and all these other crops that we grow

861
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,639
here in colorado and definitely in other

862
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,319
places so i think that's that's an

863
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,720
interesting one but then you know you

864
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:36,879
think about cannabis cryptic virus and

865
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,880
this uh cannabis that have a mito virus

866
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,278
all of them i i have no clue what they

867
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,840
do and um

868
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:43,839
yeah

869
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,558
yeah go ahead we touched on it before

870
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,240
but were you surprised not to find

871
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:54,720
tobacco mosaic virus i was surprised not

872
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,359
to find but i i believe um

873
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,319
again talking to my uh colleague in uh

874
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:04,639
canada they have found tobacco mosaic

875
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:06,158
virus we did not yes he they did

876
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,399
um what was that the one i was going to

877
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,960
say oh and the other uh paper that we

878
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,839
just published last week

879
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,720
was

880
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:18,240
showing cannabis aphid it's a newly

881
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,440
identified aphid it's original to asia

882
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,720
we only discovered it in colorado

883
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,200
in 2015 a couple of years ago and now

884
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,159
it's one of the most prolific aphids in

885
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,600
um this potato growing region here in

886
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,080
colorado and

887
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,798
happens to transmit very efficiently

888
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,278
potato virus y which is the number one

889
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:42,558
virus that affects potato

890
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:44,960
uh crops so but we did not find potato

891
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:45,839
virus buy in our hemp samples

892
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,278
okay

893
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,879
it's possible

894
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:52,240
right yeah i think everything's on the

895
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,440
table huh yes hemp is just you know

896
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,558
changed the whole um patho system

897
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,200
no and i wasn't aware that folks had

898
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,839
identified tobacco mosaic virus in

899
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,640
cannabis and or hemp yet i know we have

900
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,759
a lot of customers asking us about it we

901
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,039
haven't been able to find it in the

902
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,800
literature so if you do have some

903
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,918
information we'd be definitely

904
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,519
interested in that

905
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,799
i can definitely put you in touch i'm

906
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:19,358
pretty sure uh he mentioned this

907
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,079
but it's no it's not published okay okay

908
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,398
yeah so um but i could put you in touch

909
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,079
with dr zamir punjah he's super oh yeah

910
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,519
oh i didn't realize it was doctor punjab

911
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,519
yeah

912
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,759
yes he's he's been a guest on the

913
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,918
podcast before has he now yeah so reach

914
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,480
out to him unless i'm mistaken but

915
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,158
you're right so that's prolific it is uh

916
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,199
yeah it's interesting that we haven't

917
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,240
found it yeah especially i mean again we

918
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,598
have a lot of customers who are

919
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,439
interested in it so i've done i've done

920
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,119
some research and you know interesting

921
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,480
to find out that it was the first virus

922
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,559
ever identified

923
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,800
and that it's you know it sounds like

924
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:53,918
it's very robust and can

925
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,320
um

926
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,838
you know can still be viable long after

927
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,680
it's it's been on you know other

928
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,358
surfaces so

929
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:05,118
uh tmv i i've even heard that it can be

930
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,598
on cigarette

931
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,280
uh exactly

932
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,960
yeah we had a customer mention that like

933
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,400
oh i don't let anyone who smokes go

934
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
anywhere near our plants and we were

935
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,119
kind of

936
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,800
thinking he was just paranoid but then

937
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,599
you read more about it and like no that

938
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,880
seems pretty prudent actually yes yes

939
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,680
yeah

940
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,559
so

941
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,078
winding down here um again i think you

942
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,480
mentioned some of the the things that

943
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,359
your team is working on and things to

944
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,920
come

945
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,639
um i won't give you an opportunity to to

946
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,079
share that again and if there's any

947
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,719
website or materials or social media or

948
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,640
anything people can connect with you and

949
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:44,399
stay up to date with the

950
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,920
with the work that you guys are doing

951
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,160
please plug away

952
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,000
oh that's great thank you so like i

953
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,960
mentioned we just um published this

954
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,358
paper on cannabis aphid um

955
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,159
being a vector for pvy what we're doing

956
00:35:55,358 --> 00:36:01,119
now and this is funded by usda which is

957
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:04,078
so great that you know the usda has

958
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,599
removed these um

959
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,280
restrictions

960
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,160
against the crop which allows

961
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,519
researchers to get funded so i have um

962
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,279
good funding for um to work on pests and

963
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,838
the the big one we're focusing on is

964
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,400
hemperos it might it's almost a virus

965
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,960
it's microscopic so that's a huge one

966
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,720
that we're focusing on uh another usda

967
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,159
grant is looking at a more systematic

968
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,239
survey of

969
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,358
the virum across

970
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,159
different

971
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:36,000
growth plant phenology or growth stages

972
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,559
different cultivars to see you know if

973
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,400
there is some natural resistance

974
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,440
so that's one project that we're looking

975
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,240
on

976
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,079
um we're we're just our universities in

977
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,598
the process of updating our website so

978
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,800
we're but we were coming up with the

979
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:54,480
hemp disease website to have uh you know

980
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,720
um all of this information um updated

981
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,800
there but of course i would love to

982
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,118
connect with people on twitter i'm on

983
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,280
twitter uh just my name

984
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,160
nacho papuni i believe is the handle so

985
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,119
uh

986
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,559
yes

987
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,880
there will definitely be more things

988
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,639
coming and another thing lastly i want

989
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,599
to talk about um

990
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,679
sort of the

991
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,440
adaptive role of cannabinoids you know

992
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,399
there's research coming out about how

993
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,720
cbd has in some cases a negative impact

994
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,200
some cases a positive impact so we're

995
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,358
looking into that um

996
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,000
on insects with different mouth parts

997
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:30,000
like an aphid with a piercing mouth part

998
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,320
hemp preset mite that has more like a

999
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,039
little stub and a chewing mouth part

1000
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,720
like corn urban or eurasian hemp porter

1001
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,199
so we're trying to see how it affects

1002
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,519
different insects that feed differently

1003
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,519
so that's very exciting too

1004
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,480
yeah that is exciting and you touched on

1005
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:46,159
something we

1006
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,320
probably should have talked about it is

1007
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,480
uh resistance right i mean let's say

1008
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,480
that you know pesticides and some of

1009
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,880
these options aren't available to hemp

1010
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,800
growers um identifying natural

1011
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,920
resistance and breeding for that would

1012
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,359
would definitely

1013
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,880
be an option yes and growers you know um

1014
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:04,559
of course we're working with new west

1015
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,119
genetics and that's that's really great

1016
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,199
when growers as you probably know they

1017
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,160
are doing their own little breeding and

1018
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,159
uh

1019
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,519
you know developing their own varieties

1020
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,078
and they swear

1021
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:19,440
how one is more resistant than or

1022
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,960
tolerant to another so i think that is

1023
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,079
going to be key for hemp

1024
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,760
given how limited the insecticide

1025
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,760
options are

1026
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,800
