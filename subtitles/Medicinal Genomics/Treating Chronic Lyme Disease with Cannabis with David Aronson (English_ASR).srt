treats with cannabis his experience made

46
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,318
him curious whether others have found

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,280
success using cannabis to treat

48
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,878
persistent lime and has shared his

presentation and also with me in the

51
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,479
conversation you're about to hear we

52
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,400
covered what is Lyme disease and how

53
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:31,119
does one acquire it the different stages

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,519
of Lyme disease treatments that are

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,560
available to treat chronic lyme how

56
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,959
David collected data for the study and

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,959
which types of products are effective

58
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,800
for chronic lme

59
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,640
symptoms before we get to my

60

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,400
Aronson good afternoon David thanks so

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,759
much for joining me on the podcast

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
thanks for having me glad to be here all

82
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,759
right well I'm excited to talk with you

83
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,000
today about using cannabis to

84
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,639
potentially treat persistent in post-

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,360
treatment disease and this is a timely

86
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,199
topic for me because I actually found a

87
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,560
deer tick on my torso a few weeks back

88
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,000
thankfully I caught it early and took a

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,920
prophylactic dose of antibiotics so I'm

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
hopeful that I prevented an infection

91
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,120
but maybe we can get into that a bit um

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,079
but nevertheless Lyme disease has at

93
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,918
least been on my mind recently so uh I'm

94
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,839
happy that I've had a chance to to talk

95
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,159
with you about it here today and about

96
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,159
whether cannabis can be used to treat

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,000
long-term cases but before we get into

98
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,639
all that I think it would be helpful to

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,478
establish the basics of what Lyme

100
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,000
disease is so could you could you do

101
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,319
that for us sure absolutely and so and

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,519
and so when first defining it's

103
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,399
something important to note so Lyme

104
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,918
disease is a bacterial infection so

105
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:55,120
cannabis is not going to cure Lyme

106
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:57,560
disease at all um it's a I would I look

107
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,280
at as a as a symptomatic and pallative

108
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,918
treatment for the illness because

109
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,319
there's so many symptoms um and so many

110
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:05,519
side effects from treatments and stuff

111
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,000
like that that's very helpful in that

112
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,519
way but lime is a bacterial infection

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,360
that is transmitted uh primarily by

114
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:16,959
ticks um and the ticks uh Deer Tick

115
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,680
primarily although they're found in

116
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,038
other types of ticks um there's uh

117
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,959
blacklegged ticks in the northern

118
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,360
latitudes and in the western part of the

119
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,159
country too like in California that

120
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,919
aren't deer ticks but they also carry

121
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,240
lime disease but they're also finding it

122
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,359
in

123
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,038
uh lone star ticks and and um and uh dog

124
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,759
ticks and wood ticks it can be found in

125
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:40,120
any kind of tick it's just most commonly

126
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,680
in the deer tick

127
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,759
because uh the way the life cycle works

128
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,360
they contracted from mice actually so

129
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,160
just regular old mice are the reservoir

130
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,560
for lime and then the baby ticks pick it

131
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,160
up from that they and they can give it

132
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,439
to Deer but then they get on the deer

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,720
and they fall off deer and then they

134
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,839
often find us or they find us before the

135
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,479
deer um but like I said there are other

136
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,079
ticks and they all carry lots of

137
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,240
different presents for us so it's not

138
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,879
just lime um an ex having only Lyme

139
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,960
disease is often an exception to the

140
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:15,279
rule and so what I would encourage you

141
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,519
to do is uh just ask for a follow-up

142
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,439
test for for a full panel of the other

143
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,719
stuff um in if you at all feel unwell in

144
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:25,319
the next few weeks um because that

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,800
there's there's about a dozen things

146
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,560
that they carry that they can pass on to

147
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,478
us and it's very common for people have

148
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,560
two or three infections at a time oh wow

149
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,079
um and it's a it's a special kind of

150
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,680
bacteria it's a spet um much like

151
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,680
syphilis so it's like a little cork

152
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,120
screw and so it really gets into cells

153
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,800
um and into tissue and so it can hide

154
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,160
really well from our immune system we

155
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,240
can even hang on to white blood cells

156
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,880
themselves and then not only that but it

157
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,800
can change shape so um they you know

158
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,519
when you take if if it's been in the

159
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,520
body for a long time and well

160
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,839
established there's enough of them when

161
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,719
when they're exposed to one type of

162
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,679
antibiotic they'll actually change into

163
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,800
a different type of bacteria that's not

164
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,400
uh susceptible to that type of

165
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,918
antibiotic until it's gone then they'll

166
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,918
change back it's really it's wild

167
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,918
there's a it's just a Nutty thing so

168
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,279
it's very Advanced and it's hard to

169
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:20,598
treat once it becomes systemic in the

170
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,878
body but if you catch it very early um

171
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:24,839
then it's then just you know a few a few

172
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:29,960
rounds of doxy cycl is pretty much all

173
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:32,318
it takes for most people um but when you

174
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:34,478
when it persists it can La it can

175
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,280
persist into and tell me want you read

176
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,079
10 to 20% of people can end up have

177
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:41,239
chronic conditions um either from A

178
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,318
continuing infection or from Damage Done

179
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,000
by the the illness so what is sort of

180
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,280
like I guess this is more of a personal

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,879
question so how what is sort of the the

182
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,399
timeline from you know initial bite to

183
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,720
you're experiencing symptoms there's

184
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:59,918
three basic stages so the initial stag

185
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,840
is flu like symptoms um and so and so

186
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,038
people feel pretty sick right away so

187
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,000
like I so the reason I came so

188
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,959
interested in this is I had a really bad

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,279
case so I and so when I first had it I

190
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,719
definitely had like a summer flu that

191
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:18,119
didn't go away I went and saw the doctor

192
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,159
and she uh she gave me a line test but

193
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,158
she said I want you to come back in two

194
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,800
weeks these are very often

195
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,680
wrong and a couple weeks later I felt a

196
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,000
lot better and she said it was negative

197
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,360
so I never went back I really should

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,719
have gone back

199
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,038
um so that's something to be aware of is

200
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,320
that the the testing is terrible um for

201
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,399
Lyme disease in general it's got a

202
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,080
little better but it's uh but it's it's

203
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,599
a hard thing to detect in the body they

204
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,680
don't culture it or anything like that

205
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,839
they're looking for

206
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:50,639
antibodies that can be hard to detect

207
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,279
and so did you ever find a tick or oh

208
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,519
yeah yeah I got a scar from it and

209
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,600
everything because because what happened

210
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,799
to me was I found it the day bit me um

211
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,240
but I uh didn't have a like a tick scoop

212
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,759
or a pair of tweezers um so I I did what

213
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,879
my dad did for me as a kid which is

214
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,720
definitely you're not supposed to do is

215
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,919
I heated a paper clip red hot and I

216
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,040
killed the tick while it was on me but

217
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,039
that just uh made what that does is make

218
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,439
it regurgitate everything into you and

219
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,199
so like almost guarantee an infection oh

220
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,760
wow so that that was that was bad and I

221
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,040
had pieces of it in me I had to dig it

222
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:30,000
out is bad it really it's like worst

223
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:33,000
case scenario for that oh wow um

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,958
but they laid dormant for many years um

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,278
such was Subacute and then uh I either

226
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,439
got bitten again or or or it was also at

227
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,278
the same time it was a major life

228
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,160
stressor and then I became I had major

229
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:45,958
neurological symptoms after that oh so

230
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,838
the symptoms you experienced was well

231
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,000
after that initial so I yeah I had that

232
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,839
and then I had this like weird back pain

233
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,120
for somebody in their 20s for many years

234
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,640
um and then like I said major life

235
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,320
stress or loss in the family and all of

236
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,799
a sudden I started numb from my feet

237
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,160
up wow and then having all sorts of

238
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:08,599
weird like getting lost on the way home

239
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,879
from work and all sorts of really

240
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,639
unpleasant things lots of pain um and it

241
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:17,879
took a long time to get the right

242
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:19,639
diagnosis wow wow so I think we sort of

243
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,879
touched on it there like the different

244
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,639
stages right yeah sorry yes so there's a

245
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,439
second second stage is when it becomes

246
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:29,639
kind of more disseminating in the body

247
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,279
um where and it uh starts like joint

248
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,159
pain and stuff like that and then uh the

249
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:37,399
third stage is is in the nervous system

250
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,559
and that's when it becomes much harder

251
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,278
to treat because the typical courses of

252
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:45,399
antibiotics generally aren't effective

253
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:47,799
um usually IV antibiotics are needed so

254
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,159
prior to that sort of last stage like a

255
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,919
course of antibiotics yeah but might

256
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,719
need to be for a long time and if

257
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,559
they're multiple infections that have

258
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,920
gotten out there then you might need

259
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,679
multiple types of antibiotics um get it

260
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,319
can the treatment side like getting the

261
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,838
diagnosis is one thing but then the

262
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,278
treatment side of things is a whole

263
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,880
other kind of mess honestly because

264
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,320
there's not there's no established

265
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,639
protocol um for these multiple

266
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,120
infections and so um everybody's got

267
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,079
their own way of doing it everybody

268
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,839
thinks they're right and they're

269
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:25,039
probably right for some people and not

270
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,720
for others and sort of it's you know it

271
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,439
gets to be a tricky thing and a lot of

272
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,920
it's not covered insurance and it gets

273
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,040
really messy and so is it also an issue

274
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,958
too like you could get rid of the

275
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,199
bacteria but there's lasting effects yes

276
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:40,119
absolutely so that's that's where I'm at

277
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,320
um at this point in my life too where um

278
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,600
I I've got periperal neuropathy now from

279
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,160
it um I have an immune

280
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,720
deficiency I definitely don't have Lyme

281
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:53,278
disease anymore um but I have uh I have

282
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,320
a lot of symptoms of of without a better

283
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,120
explanation might start to look like

284
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,639
Ms um but as long as I take good care of

285
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,200
myself I'm fine

286
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,320
so what you're telling me is I should

287
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,519
call my doctor and get more antibiotics

288
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,680
yeah if You' all feel unwell in the next

289
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,919
couple weeks yeah that's what I would do

290
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,799
all right so we did all right so that

291
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,838
was great I think we we touched on how

292
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,039
people acquire it what the different

293
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,760
stages are we briefly touched about

294
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,360
different treatments now is that a

295
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,159
rabbit hole that we can go down it's a

296
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,879
bit of a rabbit hole what what I would

297
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:29,159
suggest when people get if people get

298
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:33,000
Lyme disease and the initial treat

299
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:36,240
treatment isn't enough then a great

300
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,039
thing to do is um there's a few

301
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,039
resources one is to look up um your

302
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,078
local line many especially if you're in

303
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:45,399
a major urban area or in a largely

304
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,919
populated state there's going to be lime

305
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,198
disease support groups he contact them

306
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,919
he say I'm really sick my initial

307
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:52,399
treatment is not working I'm looking for

308
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:54,479
names of doctors who specialize in

309
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,440
treating lime because it really is a

310
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,360
specialty it's called lime literate um

311
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,440
is a is a term to use I'm looking for a

312
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,680
lime literate physician there's another

313
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,800
organization called ilads it's called

314
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,559
International lme and Associated disease

315
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,120
Society they they really have

316
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,000
established a protocol for this and

317
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,000
that's where uh your lime literate

318
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,879
Physicians get their training from you

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,120
can go to their website and do a search

320
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,320
for doctors trained in your area um and

321
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,120
find somebody to talk to most of the

322
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,600
time these people will not be accepting

323
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,480
insurance and

324
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,920
so I good rule of thumb is to get a get

325
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,199
a good quality Ru out if you're sick and

326
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,759
and you want to know if you truly have

327
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:36,799
Lyme disease or not you probably expect

328
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,319
to spend somewhere around $1,000 oh wow

329
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,479
yeah just to find out if you have it

330
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,760
really yeah well if you're talking about

331
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,039
spending a doctor $200 an hour for their

332
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,240
time and then the testing is generally

333
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,919
out of

334
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,159
pocket and the testing would be from

335
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,639
those lime literate Physicians and not

336
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,480
well they would they would draw the labs

337
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,440
but there's there's a few Labs that

338
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,320
really because I told you the testing so

339
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,800
bad the standardized test there's yeah

340
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,240
Labs that are fully accredited and good

341
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,599
Labs but they they they're not uh

342
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,000
insurance covered uh generally because

343
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,360
they do their own assay um and so they

344
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,360
that's uh but they do a good job and

345
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,440
that's usually where these um doctors

346
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,120
will send the

347
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,320
tests okay yeah and I have to imagine

348
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,320
too I mean at least from my own

349
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
experience with with finding the deer

350
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,920
tick it's tiny I mean I think they

351
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,000
describe it's like the size of a sesame

352
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:30,198
seed yeah the nips can be that small yep

353
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,839
so I imagine that you know like perhaps

354
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:33,919
in your case too where you have some of

355
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,639
that that summer flu or something or

356
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,679
that you know that sickness that you

357
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,799
just can't kick and you know attribute

358
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,399
it to oh it's a virus or something but

359
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,319
it really could have been yeah my you

360
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,198
sometimes people don't know they're a

361
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,278
bit my dad almost died last year uh he

362
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:49,919
was in the emergency room in and out for

363
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:51,120
for three days they didn't know what was

364
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,719
wrong with him and he kept getting

365
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,480
fevers and and his organs were failing

366
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,560
and I showed up and I said have you

367
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,159
tested for ticks and they went what do

368
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:04,838
you do for a living never you mind and I

369
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,559
was right and then they gave him my ab

370
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,040
biotics and he bounced right back wow

371
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,078
yeah yeah and so that didn't develop

372
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:14,360
into some sort of persistent condition

373
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,599
no because it was it was a it was that

374
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,959
was a that was a rare kind of case where

375
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,000
it hit him hard and fast and it was

376
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:23,039
anaplasmosis that was really um tanking

377
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,639
him um and that and that happens

378
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:29,480
sometimes I mean he's old say 80 and and

379
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,399
yeah sometimes that happens is

380
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:37,560
fevers of like 104 oh wow yeah that's up

381
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:40,159
there yep so your your study looked

382
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,278
particularly at persistent and post-

383
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:45,399
treatment lme disease well yeah so we

384
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:49,360
called it that because um in the the

385
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:52,000
from our uh so a couple things one is I

386
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,278
didn't want to um allude to the fact

387
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,958
that one should treat acute you know

388
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:59,879
like an acute case with just cannabis

389
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,399
but also um in the data that these are

390
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,318
people that are are you know filling out

391
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,519
of form saying I have Lyme disease so I

392
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:10,318
don't know what stage they're at um but

393
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,679
so uh it's that's seemed like a large

394
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:14,679
enough grouping it's kind of safe to

395
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:16,719
assume that that they're either treating

396
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:18,120
persistent cases or post- treatment but

397
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,560
there's no reason that some of them

398
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,440
couldn't have been acute but it's just

399
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,039
unlikely if they're just in that short

400
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,440
treatment window of two weeks on doxy

401
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,519
cycling that they would enter this world

402
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,920
of treating it with cannabis right yeah

403
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,399
right the symptoms that we're tracking

404
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,198
like anxiety inflammatory pain sleep

405
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,639
those kinds of things are are common in

406
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:39,078
the later stages of life um and again if

407
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:40,639
you're treating it with cannabis you've

408
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:42,799
probably already been through the

409
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,680
standard round these are those are

410
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,559
assumptions that but we can't interview

411
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,078
these these patients so we're really

412
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,719
just looking at they say they have

413
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:55,679
lime and they're treating X symptom and

414
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,000
um and the tool helps them rate it on on

415
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:01,159
different scales so what's interesting

416
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
though as ubiquitous as lime is as much

417
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,558
as cannabis is being looked at nobody

418
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,199
had ever looked at these two together

419
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:11,160
before um and if you which is really

420
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,318
surprising because if you do a just a

421
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,160
simple Google search there's a lot um

422
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:18,918
where every dispensary is telling you

423
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,199
you should treat your lime disease with

424
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,319
cannabis and lots of lots of uh doctor's

425
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,439
websites have you know blog posts about

426
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,240
using cannabis to help with Lyme disease

427
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,519
and lots of lime blogs and and lime

428
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,400
websites tell you CBD and cannabis are

429
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,639
good symptomatic treatments but

430
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,679
absolutely nobody has done any academic

431
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,799
or formal uh look at it until now which

432
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,000
is really weird um and you know we're

433
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:46,960
doing a retrospective sort of

434
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,119
naturalistic study um and we're

435
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,200
continuing to examine more symptoms and

436
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:56,000
and and kind of parse out the data um

437
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,600
because it really is uh effective and

438
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,038
and it's interesting that it affects

439
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:04,240
people people

440
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:05,919
so the things that lime people sorry

441
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,200
Lyme disease is often a root cause of

442
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,200
things like

443
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:16,319
rheumatoid ALS it can be mistaken for

444
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,440
Parkinson's um if for loopus

445
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,480
fibromyalgia these are all things people

446
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,440
commonly use cannabis to treat right so

447
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,360
very so and they're not always caused by

448
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,919
lime but lime is one of the potential

449
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:34,158
causes of these syndromes um and so that

450
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,440
was very interesting to me too um and so

451
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,440
what we found though is that people who

452
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,679
like use it for arthritic for

453
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,519
inflammatory pain if they have lime

454
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,240
respond differently than people who are

455
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,079
using it for inflammatory pain who don't

456
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,079
have

457
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:52,480
lime uh same thing with anxiety how so

458
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:56,519
so like higher THC formulations were

459
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,759
found um more relieving for anxiety than

460
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,679
mixed Cambo ratios um

461
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,079
with in people with lime whereas when we

462
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,759
look at overall on the other end it's

463
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,240
usually the other way around like a one

464
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:09,879
to one or a high higher CBD ratio

465
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,000
Formula will be better better for lime

466
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,440
uh for anxiety I see so the THC is more

467
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,960
helpful for lime because it's better at

468
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,558
relieving inflammation right got it in a

469
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,240
sense or and so it's interesting so

470
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:24,798
there's a lot when we talk about the

471
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,359
data there's a lot I can I can say about

472
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,879
that it's pretty interesting yeah let's

473
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,158
talk about that I mean first of all you

474
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,280
know where where are you getting this

475
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:35,960
data like how yes where's it coming so

476
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:39,918
there's a there's a great um uh app and

477
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,919
website called strain print uh strain

478
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,840
print.com um and but they also track a

479
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:49,519
fair amount of American Products as well

480
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,678
so it's a really great um uh use

481
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,759
tracking

482
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:56,320
tool um

483
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:58,720
so um and I so I suggest to people

484
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,240
regardless because it's helpful because

485
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,640
you know you might say say you use you

486
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,200
use and you find oh my Pain's really

487
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,880
relieved but it also then will ask you

488
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,919
are you feeling tired are you feeling um

489
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,679
you know a irritable or upset stomach so

490
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,400
helps you note side effects as well and

491
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,038
help dial in so kind of help dial in

492
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,360
your dosing that way um but it asks

493
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,960
people to identify their disease or

494
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,079
diagnosis and then it'll give a list of

495
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,240
symptoms commonly associated with those

496
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,399
but then you can also choose your own it

497
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,720
tracks up to like 70 different symptoms

498
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,038
a

499
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,360
um and then uh you rate it how you're

500
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,038
feeling on a scale 1 to 10 before you

501
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,959
put in what you took and then and then

502
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:40,599
rate after and so he's got for if you're

503
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,038
in Canada for example all the products

504
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:45,359
in dispensaries are loaded into that app

505
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,599
so it tracks all the testing data and

506
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:51,000
stuff like that so it's also useful for

507
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,279
producers and and looking and studies to

508
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,119
say you know what canabo ratio might be

509
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,678
good for this El and that sort of thing

510
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,000
so that that's it's interesting that way

511
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:59,640
so we were able to track a lot of

512
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,480
different

513
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,360
uh ratios of uh products that people

514
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,120
used um and in this one we were no is

515
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,240
that down to like the batch level too

516
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,798
yeah yeah yeah if if it's a company

517
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,798
that's regularly submitting their stuff

518
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:18,359
yeah yeah that's awesome um yeah and so

519
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:22,798
it's it's it's it's useful in oh so many

520
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:25,678
ways it's really cool right um so the

521
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,639
the um we looked at a a combined of

522
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,278
inhaled and edible products so we kind

523
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,720
of put it all in but it would be

524
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:33,720
interesting to parse that out in the

525
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,240
future um and we looked at a range of

526
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,038
cannaboid ratios of including THC only

527
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,319
CBD only and then naturalistic ratios so

528
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:44,119
you might in the data you might see like

529
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:46,960
a 25 to1 that's that's a very high

530
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,639
THC um cannabis but it's still a

531
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,159
naturalistic ratio so it's got some

532
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,000
measurable amount of THC or CBD and

533
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:55,039
other cannaboids in there but we're

534
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,640
really just looking at THC and CBD as

535
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:01,200
well and which is something I think is

536
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,559
often not enough but it's what we have

537
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,400
more often than not um and uh and going

538
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,720
all the down one to one and on the other

539
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,120
end of things um and what we found in

540
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,600
this data set was there was an

541
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,519
overwhelming preference for THC very

542
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:21,199
very strong preference and and very high

543
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:23,759
in the THC only I note that to a product

544
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,840
availability um what's what's pushed in

545
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,519
dispensaries you know there's a higher

546
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:31,678
margin in distillate in in uh for some

547
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,200
in some way sometimes so um and then the

548
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,320
convenience factor um there as well so I

549
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,240
think that's part of it and then that's

550
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,839
also primarily what's in Edibles right

551
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,558
they use distill in Edibles as well

552
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:44,399
because then they can have an even

553
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,678
measure of dosage even though it may not

554
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,600
be the best delivery method so while

555
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,919
that was used the most often not in

556
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,879
every case was it the most preferred but

557
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,640
it always scored very high um but when

558
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,159
you when you look at other ones what

559
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:07,120
often scored equally High um and uh or

560
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:10,919
better with less dosages um uh was

561
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:13,918
naturalistic ratios or one to one um CBD

562
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:17,000
only often also didn't perform very well

563
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,159
in general um then what was we also

564
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,159
looked at gender differences what was

565
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:26,240
really fascinating here was um so for

566
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:29,640
pain um I just I want to make sure I get

567
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,679
it right so yeah no take a

568
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:37,120
we found in

569
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:43,440
anxiety um like I said uh THC only um

570
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:46,599
performed uh really high um among uh it

571
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,720
performed better um for for women than

572
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:53,359
it did for uh for men which was

573
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,480
interesting I'm sorry for then than the

574
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,439
CBD

575
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,200
did um and then it was somewhat reversed

576
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:05,159
for the inflammatory pain where men

577
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,960
found it uh found a better uh result and

578
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,039
efficacy from higher CBD than THC and

579
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,319
and women found High higher THC more

580
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:14,798
efficac interesting inflammation too

581
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,918
which is so that doesn't say anything in

582
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,000
particular other than it's really

583
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,640
important that we continue to examine

584
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,159
gender differences because there

585
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,640
whenever we do there are um I I believe

586
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,080
it's been a long time since I looked at

587
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,360
what it was um but um there's a study

588
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:36,000
that looked at uh blood levels um and

589
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,639
women have will yield higher levels of

590
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,159
THC from equal dosages often in their

591
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,399
blood so there so there's it's just

592
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,440
really important that we look at those

593
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,839
differences so that we can better

594
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,360
understand how to help people so what I

595
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,678
for example so if you had somebody with

596
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,119
high anxiety you might not suggest that

597
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,840
they use a high Tac product but with

598
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,038
this data you could you could feel

599
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,000
better about that or when they're

600
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,960
telling you that that's what they're

601
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,359
using you might not say oh you shouldn't

602
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,278
do that H and sorry to Circle back but I

603
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,479
believe you were saying that you know

604
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:10,159
you know a lot of these symptoms are

605
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,159
similar to other conditions like

606
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,480
fibromyalgia or you know inflammation

607
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,480
and things like that but the what was

608
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,880
effective for you know for that versus

609
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,798
what's effective for lime was different

610
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,360
so I

611
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,839
mean if if someone is at the stage where

612
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,599
it's sort of more persistent lime and

613
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,959
that may have been uh undiagnosed before

614
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,158
is that something that they could get

615
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,319
tested for to kind of get a better yep

616
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:42,840
absolutely yes yeah and so I you know

617
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:45,439
anybody so I um have been a therapist

618
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,038
for a long time that's how I kind that's

619
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,880
why I got into the education of this

620
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,720
because I realized as I was sick that I

621
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,080
had I know I had seen so many people

622
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,640
that had had this because there's really

623
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,879
strong psychiatric presentations and so

624
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,640
whenever somebody if somebody gets this

625
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,240
far along into it they're going to have

626
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,320
anxiety or uh insomnia uh depression is

627
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,679
very very common um in line in fact

628
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,398
there's a guy out of Columbia Brian

629
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:14,600
Fallon who uh has done studies where he

630
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:19,759
he draws a causitive link to L which is

631
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:21,599
a pretty daring thing to do um so the

632
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,599
it's anytime people have a kind of

633
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:28,439
persistent mental health disorder with a

634
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:31,480
um not clearly diagnosed or or a Sy

635
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,519
syndrome type illness that's chronic I

636
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,798
it's and and especially if you live in

637
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,240
the northeast or spend a lot of time

638
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:41,359
there it's worth

639
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,919
checking right you know and and uh and

640
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,079
that that can be a challenge to get

641
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,600
people to look

642
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,199
at though the tide is changing slowly um

643
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,398
it is looked at more and more especially

644
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,360
up in this area and now so once people

645
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:57,398
kind of get to this persistent or post

646
00:26:54,359 --> 00:27:01,199
treatment stage is it then just all

647
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:04,119
about managing symptoms yeah yeah so I

648
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,840
mean it's it's complicated some people

649
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:09,879
get a lot better um when they they take

650
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:12,158
antibiotics and uh and but there's a way

651
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,799
that the illness works that there's a

652
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:19,000
stage in treatment where um and it waxes

653
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:20,960
a way it Cycles where you it

654
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,038
precipitates symptoms and you feel a lot

655
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,798
worse for a while and then before you

656
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:27,919
feel better and that the length of time

657
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,278
that goes on is different for some

658
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,799
people and a lot of people get um get

659
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:35,679
really discouraged and don't continue

660
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,240
their treatments um and so it really VAR

661
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,000
and some people can't don't get any

662
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,278
better some people hit a wall and they

663
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,159
they don't get any better um or there

664
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:46,000
are certain things they could do that

665
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,039
they don't do you know like major diet

666
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,640
changes and things like that um so it is

667
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:54,038
really really

668
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,159
variable is all I can say is it's a it's

669
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:58,640
all very um individualized treatment um

670
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:02,200
which is one of the reasons can is so

671
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,559
helpful um so like before I was

672
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,159
diagnosed um you know I I would use

673
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,480
cannabis for the thing that we would

674
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,919
always use Canabis for you to have fun

675
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,759
um and relax and unwind and help me

676
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,880
sleep but um when uh when I was

677
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,960
diagnosed I was taking you know

678
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,559
prescriptions for pain the nerve pain is

679
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,919
terribly hard to treat I was taking uh

680
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:26,639
prescriptions for sleep and and uh uh

681
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:30,000
things to help me stay

682
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,679
awake awful it was really awful um yeah

683
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,319
because I'd be ex I'd be basically

684
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,600
falling asleep during the day and unable

685
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,960
to sleep at night and when I when I

686
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,278
understood that I had lme disease I

687
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,440
stopped taking all those things and I

688
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,359
was able to manage all of my symptoms uh

689
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,159
with cannabis um and and I would I so I

690
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:48,319
was able to get through all that

691
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,760
antibiotic treatment you know the nausea

692
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:53,798
and the the the the it can really caused

693
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,079
you know low mood and all that I was

694
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:57,798
able to get through all that and manage

695
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:59,879
that really well with with using canvas

696
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:03,480
and is that um you know a combination

697
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,640
THC CBD yeah yeah I mean I I for me it

698
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,960
was it's it was pretty much High I used

699
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,159
a lot of high CBD flour and a lot of

700
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,919
high THC flour I I am not able to use

701
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:11,799
Edibles I'm one of those people that I

702
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,679
could

703
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:17,319
eat and that nothing happens um that is

704
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,720
generally the the best for people

705
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,079
although with when you have a lot of

706
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,519
medications that's one of the good

707
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,639
things about cannabis is you can use it

708
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,759
in a method that's not going to tr cause

709
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,440
um dangerous drug interactions by

710
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:32,640
inhaling it so you bypass the liver so

711
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,360
it's one a good Advantage um but yeah it

712
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,960
really it managed pain it help me sleep

713
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,479
um it can uh help um you know lower

714
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,159
immune inflammation without lowering

715
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,440
your immunity because steroid treatments

716
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,000
when you have an infection aren't an

717
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,000
option right so that's a it really fills

718
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,519
in a lot of gaps for people with this

719
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,919
kind of chronic illness yeah no and

720
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,120
that's true for cannabis in general

721
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,720
right it is very useful for sort of

722
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:00,558
these tough to treat um diseases yeah

723
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,120
it's not it's you know my I do a lot of

724
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,639
education for health professionals and

725
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:07,000
and what I always started by saying is

726
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,278
it doesn't cure anything but it's it's a

727
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,960
just the one of the best symptomatic

728
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,919
treatments for almost

729
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,679
everything in many

730
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:19,399
ways all right well David winding down

731
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,880
here um any sort of closing thoughts or

732
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:23,278
maybe things we didn't cover with

733
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,200
respect to Lime or or the data that I

734
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,720
would say look for more you know uh

735

myself and the person Dave David Berg

736

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,360
examining more symptoms and and uh we're

738
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,000
looking for academic Partners to help

739
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:37,558
