canmed medical practicum

74
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,479
topics we discussed include why dosing

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,759
medical cannabis is different from other

76
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,598
therapeutics

77
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,719
the fact that cannabinoids can have a

78
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:59,199
biphasic and even triphasic effects

79
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,080
how a patient's optimal dose can change

80
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,719
over time

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,879
commonly going down how patients

82
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,639
commonly build a tolerance to the

83
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,359
adverse effects of cannabis

84
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,839
but not the benefits the benefits of

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,120
working with a trained medical provider

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,959
to determine one's optimal dose but also

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
strategies for how patients can find

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,158
their own

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,719
how cannabis can be used for health

90
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,878
promotion and disease prevention

91
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,199
and how using a variety of cannabis

92
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,000
cultivars and not sticking to just one

93
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,039
strain

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,639
can actually be a benefit for patients

95
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,479
before we get to my conversation with

96

with dr dustin sulak

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
good afternoon dustin thank you so much

140
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,839
for joining us

141
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,000
my pleasure ben glad to be here okay

142
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,679
let's talk about dosing it's one of

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,759
those topics that our audience

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,120
is always curious about and for good

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
reason i suspect

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,319
it seems that cannabis is difficult to

147
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
dose properly

148
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,519
for a number of reasons is that fair to

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
say

150
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,680
i would call it different maybe not

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,479
difficult it's it's different than

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,959
what medical providers are used to

153
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,879
because

154
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,478
you know we're used to saying oh you've

155
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,038
got high blood pressure here let me give

156
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,038
you

157
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,318
this number of milligrams take it twice

158
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:01,599
a day and that's kind of the standard

159
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,840
prescription

160
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,039
and cannabis really requires that we get

161
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,918
into more of a

162
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,519
personalized recommendation a

163
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,399
personalized regimen

164
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,240
for each person and not only that but

165
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,318
sometimes for each problem

166
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,400
so it's it's more individualized and

167
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
therefore more nuanced but i think with

168
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,399
some basic principles it doesn't have to

169
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,599
be

170
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,038
difficult or confusing

171
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,039
okay so what are some of those basic

172
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,959
principles okay

173
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,318
well let's let's start out with the fact

174
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,399
that everybody's different in their

175
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
response to cannabis in particular their

176
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,918
response to thc

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
so if i'm sitting across the room from a

178
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,758
new patient that's never tried cannabis

179
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,080
before and say they're wanting to use

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,879
cannabis for pain or sleep or anxiety or

181
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,199
anything else

182
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,519
i have no idea is this a two milligram

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,000
person or a 20 milligram person

184
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,598
and and literally that it's that range

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
and sometimes even broader you know i

186
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,560
have some people that

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,919
would be sensitive to as little as one

188
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,598
milligram of thc

189
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,680
when taken by mouth and some people that

190
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,560
can go way higher than that without side

191
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,959
effects

192
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,680
or or tolerance building which i'm sure

193
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,000
we'll talk

194
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,598
talk about in a little bit so without

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,038
knowing where someone's at in their

196
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,918
level of sensitivity

197
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,639
which probably has many factors that

198
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,519
influence that

199
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
including one's age one's gender

200
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,120
probably

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,399
less so influenced by one's size or

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,560
one's body weight

203
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,318
but um there's probably genetic factors

204
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,000
in there and we don't know all of them

205
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,919
so if i don't know if you're a two or

206
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
twenty milligram person we start at two

207
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,478
and we methodically work up through that

208
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
range

209
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,839
with a lot of patient education on

210
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
here's what to look for

211
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,918
when you start responding here's what to

212
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,000
look for when you might start having

213
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,318
adverse effects and that's going to

214
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,759
inform you where that therapeutic window

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,479
is like where does that range

216
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,240
between what works for you and what

217
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,399
starts to cause side effects and so

218
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,400
we we identify that and it often takes

219
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,198
people anywhere between a week and

220
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:58,239
even a month depending on how slow and

221
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,000
cautious we're going

222
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,280
and and then i'll just comment on cbd

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,240
which is you know so

224
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,000
so similar to thc in a lot of ways in

225
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,519
terms of it can help a lot of the same

226
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,120
things it can help with pain

227
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,878
inflammation anxiety and so forth but

228
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,639
very different when it comes to dosing

229
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,000
because people it's usually very

230
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,319
forgiving right people

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,360
rarely get into trouble taking too much

232
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,000
cbd

233
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,680
uh you know it's a more common problem

234
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,560
is that they're not taking enough so the

235
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,439
milligram dosing for cbd and thc is way

236
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,759
different you know i

237
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,918
think very few people are ever going to

238
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,759
feel 2 milligrams of cbd

239
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,360
most people need to get to 5 or 10

240
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,479
milligrams before they even start to

241
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,200
feel something

242
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,879
and with cbd often more is better

243
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,640
especially if they're using a cbd a

244
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,000
really cbd dominant like a hemp

245
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,439
preparation

246
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,799
it's usually upper limit limited by cost

247
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
you know i think a lot of people would

248
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,359
be using higher doses and getting better

249
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,838
results

250
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,839
if it weren't so expensive but then that

251
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,519
there's the opportunity to really

252
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,360
uh do what i think so many of your

253
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,959
listeners understand is the combination

254
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,519
of the two it's not thc or

255
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:06,719
cbd it's it's really using both of them

256
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,720
strategically together

257
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,519
and then i would imagine too beyond just

258
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,240
thc and cbd there's there's terpenes

259
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,919
there's other

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
minor cannabinoids that could be playing

261
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,240
a role so how does that

262
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,000
entourage effect further complicate

263
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,240
dosing considerations

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,039
sure so i you know i think the biggest

265
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
influence

266
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,159
is when it comes to inhaled cannabis you

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,559
know when people are either smoking or

268
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,919
vaporizing cannabis flower i will see

269
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,759
extraordinarily distinct extraordinary

270
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,519
distinctions between

271
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,439
you know one variety of cannabis and

272
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
another one might be very uplifting and

273
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,560
energizing one might be very sedating

274
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,759
one might do nothing for pain but really

275
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,919
help with anxiety

276
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,838
and the other you know the opposite some

277
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,159
might stimulate appetite or suppress it

278
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,399
so

279
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,439
it's just really all over the place with

280
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,399
those varieties

281
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,920
i think that in most situations once the

282
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,320
flower is processed

283
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,000
into an oil or a tincture or a capsule

284
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,640
or edible or something like that

285
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,559
a lot of those differences are kind of

286
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,879
washed out with the processing

287
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,559
now more people in the cannabis industry

288
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,399
and my company healer

289
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,559
are one of the leaders in this are we're

290
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,759
working on how do we get all the virtues

291
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,719
of that flower

292
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,240
into a bottle you know or into a pill

293
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,040
because those distinctions are are

294
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,839
really nice

295
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,679
there's also um in my mind and in my

296
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
experience a lot of rationale for

297
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,399
blending

298
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,560
the varieties together and having you

299
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,639
know like a wide spectrum kind of a

300
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,719
shotgun approach product

301
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,759
which can be more straightforward and

302
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,639
easy to use and

303
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,958
and more versatile for a wide range of

304
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,958
people

305
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,278
so um yeah so i guess getting back to

306
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,519
you know your question terpenes

307
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,720
i think i think of that more as like the

308
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,200
fine tuning

309
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
and so my first goal with the patient is

310
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,839
to

311
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,839
kind of orient myself to their general

312
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,279
dosing range general sensitivity like

313
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
first of all are they responding to

314
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:59,679
cannabis i mean believe it or not not

315
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,518
everybody

316
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,199
who tries to use cannabis for pain or

317
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,600
sleep or one of these conditions

318
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,640
uh receives benefit even though most do

319
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,720
you know what

320
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,319
and um those who don't usually we can

321
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,320
kind of switch to

322
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,839
cannabis plan b and get some good

323
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,360
results there too because there's always

324
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,120
so many different things to try in the

325
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,519
world of cannabis

326
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,839
but if they are responding general

327
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,440
ballpark of what number of milligrams

328
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,920
are we talking about that's like

329
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,120
the big knob on the old-fashioned radio

330
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,759
where you're like tuning into the

331
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,440
station

332
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,720
and then the fine-tuning knob we do it a

333
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,760
follow-up visit which might have

334
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,600
everything to do with

335
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,120
the terpene profile of the product

336
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,720
they're using and

337
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
then what's been really exciting to me

338
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,240
are the acidic cannabinoids

339
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,959
so i've been watching this for several

340
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,120
years now that thca and cbda in

341
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,599
particular are powerful agents that have

342
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,278
been

343
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,879
overlooked for a long time they seem to

344
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,679
be more top

345
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,838
you know better tolerated more effective

346
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,439
especially at very low doses than their

347
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
neutral counterparts

348
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,600
but not substitutes you know i'm not in

349
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,560
any way suggesting that thca is a

350
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,278
substitute

351
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,679
for thc they act very differently but i

352
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,879
almost

353
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,679
always recommend including some thca

354
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,000
in any thc product and and that's for a

355
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,159
variety of reasons number one thca

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,399
does have some distinct mechanisms of

357
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,319
action that thc doesn't have

358
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,559
but also it's been shown to be a

359
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,720
positive allosteric modulator

360
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,719
at the cb1 receptor which means it can

361
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,600
kind of turn up the volume turn up the

362
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,560
activity

363
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,480
and actually potentiate or make the thc

364
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,078
more potent and more effective so one

365
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,560
could use a lower dose

366
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,078
also the the pharmacokinetics are all

367
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,399
interacting which means

368
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,919
when we take these cannabinoids together

369
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,799
especially say we take

370
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,919
thca and thc we take them by mouth and

371
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,759
they go to the liver

372
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,679
well now we've got two compounds that

373
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,319
are competing for metabolism in the

374
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,958
liver

375
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
and that would slow the breakdown of thc

376
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,319
so having some thca

377
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,000
in there again kind of not only

378
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,839
potentiates

379
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,120
what we would call the pharmacodynamic

380
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,160
effect it doesn't

381
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,000
only make the action of thc more potent

382
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,519
but it slows its breakdown

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,278
and therefore makes it last longer in

384
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,159
the system and be more potent in that

385
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:09,439
way

386
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,519
and then finally these acidic

387
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,200
cannabinoids are absorbed way better

388
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
you know what makes them acidic is they

389
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
have a carboxylic acid

390
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,799
functional group on them so they're a

391
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,680
little bit more water-soluble

392
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,240
and that increases their absorption it

393
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,638
looks like

394
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,799
you know the uh the cbda is absorbed

395
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,919
somewhere between 5 and 11 times better

396
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,559
than cbd

397
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,199
thca might be absorbed up to 50 times

398
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,278
better

399
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
than thc when taken by mouth so you

400
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:35,519
don't need much of those so that that's

401
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,919
another

402
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,198
really exciting piece uh for improving

403
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,639
results with and

404
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,399
being able to use a lower dose

405
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,919
yeah and i would imagine being able to

406
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,078
use a lower dose

407
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,240
is better for patients just because cost

408
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,958
has to be such a limiting factor when

409
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,600
trying to determine dose it really is i

410
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,278
mean my

411
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,680
like kind of the nature of my practice

412
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,198
is cost effective solutions to

413
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,638
problems that have failed to respond to

414
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,519
conventional treatment this is what i've

415
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,759
been doing

416
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,399
for 11 years and um yeah it's

417
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,639
finding a way for people to afford this

418
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,360
or to be able to produce their own

419
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,839
and and make their own and sometimes not

420
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
have to

421
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,839
to be able to do that without spending a

422
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,958
lot of money on lab tests and all that i

423
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,560
think these are two

424
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,000
really important strategies for

425
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,319
empowering patients

426
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,198
you know the the self-cultivation and

427
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,240
self-production

428
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,319
is just such a therapeutic activity unto

429
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,639
itself you know i feel like that alone

430
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
has

431
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
great healing power and the patient just

432
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,519
feels so good about the fact that

433
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,439
they've made something that's now

434
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,198
bringing them relief so i support that

435
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
in a lot of my patients as well it's

436
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,198
obviously not legal for people to do

437
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,120
that everywhere but it certainly is here

438
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,759
in maine

439
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,839
that's excellent and so you talked about

440
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,319
when you're starting with a patient you

441
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,959
you have a starting dose to sort of be

442
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,519
able to

443
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,599
determine the therapeutic window what is

444
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,399
that where where do you typically start

445
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,120
yeah so on a thc side of things if

446
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,759
there's no

447
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,240
nothing that informs me that they're

448
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,559
either

449
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,759
super sensitive to thc or that they're

450
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,278
not that sensitive

451
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,720
you know if i have no historical

452
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:11,679
information like that i started two

453
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
milligrams

454
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,799
i warned them that the starting dose

455
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,799
might do zero for them

456
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,479
but um we're gonna we're gonna go up

457
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,439
methodically and find the dose that

458
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,759
works

459
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,440
um and that you know there's some

460
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,120
exceptions to that sometimes if it's a

461
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,639
daytime treatment and somebody's very

462
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,000
active and they're driving and i want to

463
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,159
really make sure that there's

464
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,879
no impairment i'll start with say one

465
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:36,000
milligram we have a product here that's

466
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,838
four one part thc and four parts cbd

467
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,198
with a little bit of the thca and the

468
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,920
cbda in there

469
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,838
and so a common um kind of take with

470
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,319
breakfast recommendation i have it would

471
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,320
be

472
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,519
start with five milligrams total of that

473
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,759
so that's

474
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,560
approximately one milligram of thc and

475
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,720
one of c

476
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,758
and five of cbd and that's a nice safe

477
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,040
starting place and

478
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,879
believe it or not a lot of people are

479
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,639
starting to say yeah i think i actually

480
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,639
felt a little something there

481
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,560
and then as we go up it it starts

482
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,720
getting better and better so that kind

483
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,799
of orients that lower end of the dosing

484
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,639
range

485
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,039
and so in preparation for for talking to

486
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,639
you about about dosing today i went back

487
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,278
and i watched the

488
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,039
the panel from kmed 2019 that you were a

489
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,240
participant on along with

490
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,399
a number of other doctors and you guys

491
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,839
got into some really great data a lot of

492
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,679
great information and i'll share the

493
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,959
link in the show notes here

494
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,719
and one of the things that was really

495
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,758
interesting was sort of this

496
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,160
biphasic effect that cannabinoids can

497
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,399
have

498
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,000
where at a low dose they can be not as

499
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,519
effective but and at a very high

500
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,559
dose they can't be very effective i was

501
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
wondering if you could talk more about

502
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,239
that

503
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,879
right so this sweet spot that we see in

504
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,480
cannabis

505
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,198
is um yeah this this is what can i say

506
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,440
cannabis

507
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,120
is known for these dichotomies like

508
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,480
everywhere you look in cannabinoid

509
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,000
research you see them

510
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,680
it's of course it's going to show up in

511
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,679
dosing as well but

512
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,439
this would indicate that if someone

513
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,000
starts at a low dose

514
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,199
and they gradually increase the dose for

515
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,199
a little while there

516
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,359
each dose increase is going to result in

517
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,240
a stronger therapeutic effect so that

518
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,399
would be

519
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,480
one phase of the relationship a direct

520
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,720
relationship between dose going up

521
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,000
and therapeutic effect going up and then

522
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,558
at some point

523
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,279
there's an kind of an apex to that phase

524
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,279
and as you

525
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,879
increase the dose even more the

526
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,160
therapeutic effect will start

527
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,240
to diminish and what what often happens

528
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,640
to patients that don't understand this

529
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,798
is they're saying wow i increased the

530
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,080
dose and it's not working as well as it

531
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,359
used to

532
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,119
you know something must be wrong with

533
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,599
this i should increase the dose even

534
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,918
more

535
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,719
right it's it that only makes sense to

536
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,400
most people

537
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,240
so they increase the dose even more they

538
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,160
might temporarily feel

539
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,079
a stronger effect but then within a few

540
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
days they're feeling even less of a

541
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,240
therapeutic effect than they did

542
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
previously

543
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,599
and they repeat and repeat and before

544
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,038
long they're taking this high dose and

545
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,519
barely feeling it at all

546
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:00,079
and this is a process known as tolerance

547
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,720
building it happens readily with thc but

548
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,720
it's also

549
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,839
very easy to reverse and we can talk

550
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
about that as well

551
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,079
another really strange thing about thc

552
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,400
is that it's might not just be biphasic

553
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,199
it could be triphasic so at very high

554
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,519
doses

555
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,200
they could start to recover that direct

556
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,720
relationship and have the therapeutic

557
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,880
effect start growing

558
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,720
again in the in the in a positive

559
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,799
direction unfortunately that's going to

560
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,440
be a much more expensive treatment

561
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,359
and usually the kind of maximal

562
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,000
therapeutic effect at the high dosing

563
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,959
range

564
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,720
isn't as nice isn't as beneficial to the

565
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,000
patient as it is in that kind of low

566
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,038
moderate dose

567
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,119
so the other thing is though people

568
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,919
when they find their sweet spot like if

569
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,359
they really explore this dosing range

570
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,360
and figure out what is that

571
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,119
maximum dose that gives me the benefit

572
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,719
without the tolerance building without

573
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,798
the loss of efficacy

574
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,120
people are able to stay at that dose for

575
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,839
years or decades without it ever losing

576
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,119
effects

577
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,038
so it really benefits people to take the

578
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,279
time to methodically figure out

579
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,960
what is their optimal dose because when

580
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,440
they know that they're set they can

581
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,480
stay on that dose for a long time and

582
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,240
usually

583
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,480
over time people will start to feel

584
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,839
better and then their dose goes down a

585
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,519
little bit you know as their health

586
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,399
improves they require less and less

587
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,720
cannabis maybe

588
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,679
the physiology just doesn't need it as

589
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,000
much

590
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,600
so that's the trend i typically see but

591
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,359
most people would never think

592
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,279
oh wow the cannabis isn't working as

593
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,839
well as it used to i should reduce my

594
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,160
dose

595
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,199
like that's just not that intuitive but

596
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,880
that's actually what works

597
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,038
yeah that's really that's really

598
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,520
fascinating and

599
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,160
i wonder and you can certainly tell me

600
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,240
if i'm wrong

601
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,440
but i mean the whole idea of having a

602
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,079
cannabinoid therapy

603
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,759
is to make up for a deficiency in

604
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,759
endocannabinoids right

605
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,038
so could it be that by using

606
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,599
cannabinoids

607
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,279
it sort of retrains your system to be

608
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,240
producing those endocannabinoids and

609
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,200
maybe that's why

610
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,160
you don't need to supplement so much

611
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
absolutely

612
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,080
that's i think that's a lot of what we

613
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,679
see in that lower dosing range when we

614
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,439
first start out you know there's a

615
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,000
a handful of animal studies that have

616
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,798
shown when you administer thc to

617
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,599
rodents in particular at certain doses

618
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:13,038
you can kind of

619
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,879
up regulate their either their

620
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,319
production of endocannabinoids or their

621
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,400
cb1 receptor

622
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,599
density meaning how many receptors their

623
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,320
cells are producing

624
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,319
or the sensitivity of those receptors so

625
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,720
there's some evidence to suggest this

626
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,960
but i i think this takes us um back to

627
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,079
this concept of therapeutic window

628
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,000
what we see in um because this this

629
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,759
concept of tolerance building

630
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,440
can happen at different rates in

631
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,720
different parts of the body in different

632
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,120
parts of the brain

633
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,919
and reverse tolerance can also happen

634
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,359
you know i think

635
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,759
one of one of the really interesting

636
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,639
features i've recognized about cannabis

637
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,960
over the years

638
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,480
is when i ask large groups of people you

639
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,079
know the first time you ever smoke

640
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
cannabis when you were a teenager or

641
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,319
whatever did you feel it

642
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,519
and so many hands go up like no i did

643
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,759
not feel it

644
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,599
right some sometimes people have to use

645
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,480
it two or three times to even experience

646
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,240
it at all

647
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,400
now that might just be due to the fact

648
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,839
that their kind of sensory awareness

649
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,600
wasn't attuned to that

650
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,038
psychoactive shift and they didn't know

651
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,639
that they were stoned but they really

652
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,119
were i think there's probably some of

653
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,799
that

654
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,879
but there's also some evidence

655
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,720
suggesting that it was that first dose

656
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,600
of cannabis that kind of primed their

657
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,679
system

658
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,719
and then made them more sensitive to it

659
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,640
when they took it

660
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,400
the second time and so from a

661
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,880
therapeutic window perspective

662
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,880
what i see when people that are cannabis

663
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,080
naive so they haven't used cannabis

664
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,559
before when they first start using

665
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,678
cannabis and we get kind of over that

666
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,119
threshold

667
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,679
of some therapeutic effect

668
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,519
in the next few days they become more

669
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,798
sensitive to that without changing the

670
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,119
dose at all

671
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,879
so like say two milligrams did nothing

672
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,399
three milligrams i start to feel a

673
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,640
little bit of relief in my back

674
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,400
okay stay at three milligrams on day

675
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,159
three or day four that three milligrams

676
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,159
is starting to feel stronger than it did

677
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,159
when they first started three milligrams

678
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,840
so that would be a widening of the

679
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,840
therapeutic window with the

680
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,038
lowest effective dose actually going

681
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,879
down a little bit

682
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,240
and then we also get this widening of

683
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,400
the therapeutic window

684
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,480
with the dose that causes the adverse

685
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,880
effects getting pushed back a little bit

686
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,679
and this we typically see it with some

687
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,760
of the um

688
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,320
the motor effects so when when people

689
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,200
first kind of go over that line

690
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,000
into side effect territory one of the

691
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,000
things they

692
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,919
they report us either dizziness or

693
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,798
clumsiness or just feeling a little

694
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,559
unsteady

695
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,079
and that has to do with kind of the

696
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,200
psychomotor response in some of the

697
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,759
areas of the brain

698
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
that control our body movements and it's

699
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,640
it's been

700
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,600
shown that the areas of the brain that

701
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
control these

702
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,798
physical functions will build tolerance

703
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,519
to thc

704
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,519
faster than areas of the brain that

705
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,798
control pain signaling or that control

706
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,879
anxiety

707
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,158
or some of the other effects some of the

708
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,280
cognitive and cerebral

709
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,600
effects of the thc and so

710
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,879
people could stay at that dose they're

711
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,639
feeling a little wobbly

712
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,480
okay well don't go up anymore but just

713
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
stay at that dose for a few days

714
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,079
and a few days later the wobbly thing is

715
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,079
gone but the pain relief is still there

716
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,159
so this whole idea that you can build a

717
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,119
tolerance to the adverse effects but not

718
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,440
to the benefits

719
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,319
exactly and to do that you got to be

720
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,759
methodical

721
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,599
and you really have to be paying

722
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,519
attention to your body's response and

723
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,839
your mind's response to cannabis

724
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,759
um but but yeah absolutely and same with

725
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,240
the memory loss same with the kind of

726
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,279
uh you know the giggles i mean anything

727
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,919
whether it's a

728
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,279
an adverse effect uh in some situations

729
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,640
and maybe not in others but

730
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,798
you know most of my patients don't want

731
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,200
to be high all the time and

732
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,158
you know even without cbd even with a

733
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,600
pure thc

734
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,360
treatment i really want to emphasize

735
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,278
that people can get relief of pain

736
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,678
relief of anxiety spasm

737
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,119
many other symptoms without getting into

738
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,000
the territory of

739
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,359
impairment you know and and even if at

740
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,759
first they're feeling a little bit of

741
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,119
that

742
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,879
they can build tolerance to that and

743
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,879
maintain that therapeutic efficacy

744
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,679
so seeing as though you need to take a

745
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,240
real methodical approach and there's a

746
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,559
lot of

747
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,319
patience that needs to be taken as well

748
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,158
with really finding the right dose

749
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,079
how important is it for patients to work

750
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,840
with an experienced health care provider

751
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,240
when trying to figure out their optimal

752
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,158
dose

753
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,839
i really don't like to limit people

754
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,760
because unfortunately there's not a lot

755
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,240
of experienced healthcare providers out

756
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,919
there

757
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,759
that work with cannabis and so you know

758
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,240
a big part of my mission is to help

759
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,359
people

760
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,120
circumvent that if they need to but of

761
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,399
course if you have the option of seeing

762
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,000
someone that's been

763
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,679
you know treating patients with cannabis

764
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,519
for five years or something like that i

765
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,038
i encourage any listener to at least

766
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,679
explore that they're likely going to

767
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:43,759
find

768
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
uh some pearls there that they wouldn't

769
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,158
have found on their own

770
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,079
plus it's um a lot of people just in

771
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,520
in general in our society but especially

772
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,038
people that have been suffering for a

773
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,558
long time have been through the medical

774
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,798
system and haven't found the

775
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,240
results they're looking for they might

776
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,278
be less aware

777
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,720
of their bodies and less aware of their

778
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,119
you know just kind of like where they're

779
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,640
at i had a patient yesterday who i was

780
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,239
you know i said well how have you been

781
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,120
doing in the last month since i saw you

782
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,278
last well

783
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,558
you know my back pain is a little bit

784
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,759
better okay

785
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,000
how much better you know and eventually

786
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,359
i

787
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,119
kind of fished out of her that it was

788
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,399
about 30 percent better and she really

789
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,119
noticed that she was able to do the

790
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,038
dishes

791
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,879
without having you know to stop a few

792
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,119
times in the middle so that was a big

793
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,720
a big one i said anything else no i

794
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,359
think that's it otherwise i'm doing

795
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,798
pretty good

796
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,639
how about your migraines how many of

797
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,918
those have you had in the last month

798
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,440
oh my god i've had none okay and so like

799
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,799
she wouldn't even have known that she

800
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,320
wasn't paying attention to that she

801
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,400
wasn't taking notes on that that was a

802
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,000
huge surprise for her when i asked her

803
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,200
that question because previously it was

804
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,278
one to two a week

805
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,640
and and the listeners right now might be

806
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:49,839
thinking like oh my god how can this

807
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
woman not know

808
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,519
that you know that she stopped having

809
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,559
migraines but this is very common so

810
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,400
people

811
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,839
sometimes really benefit from a third

812
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,679
party there that can

813
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,278
be more objective and hold them

814
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,880
accountable and ask the right questions

815
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,880
and kind of reflect back to them

816
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,240
the progress and the pitfalls and the

817
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
successes

818
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,640
to help people accomplish that without

819
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,239
the help of a provider

820
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,159
i developed something really simple

821
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,319
called the inner inventory

822
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,159
which is just a three to four measure

823
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,519
scale that takes about 30 seconds to

824
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,440
perform on oneself

825
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,200
you take a deep breath you rate on a

826
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,240
scale from one to ten how smooth and

827
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,558
easy that was

828
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,079
you hold still for a few seconds and you

829
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,720
rate how comfortable you are in your

830
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,480
body

831
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,319
and then you put on a fake smile and you

832
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,919
see how real it feels

833
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,519
over the course of a few seconds and

834
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,200
that's you can rate that on a scale from

835
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,879
one to ten and then if there's a primary

836
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,798
symptom you're dealing with you can

837
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,080
rate that's and that that symptoms

838
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,000
intensity and

839
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,678
and so with our products that we make we

840
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
provide worksheets

841
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,038
for people to record their inner

842
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,840
inventory a few times a day basically

843
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:51,599
before

844
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,599
in a little while after their cannabis

845
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,278
dosing and a shift in that inner

846
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,639
inventory is a nice sign

847
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,720
that they're at a dose that they're

848
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,480
starting to feel a response to

849
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,038
and and so that's you know there's all

850
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,640
sorts of ways to circumvent but i think

851
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,400
i would recommend the listeners if

852
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,080
you're using cannabis and your goal is

853
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,038
optimal health and you have access to

854
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,558
someone like me

855
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,240
that's been doing this for a long time

856
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,720
it's probably worth a consult

857
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,278
and then if you're new to cannabis and

858
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,798
you're

859
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,640
worried about it and you just want

860
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,038
someone to be there to support you and

861
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,600
supervise this i you know i think

862
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:27,440
working with an expert is going to

863
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:29,359
create a faster path to success

864
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,558
that's excellent those resources sound

865
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,038
great and i'd love to link

866
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,960
those as well in the show notes and one

867
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,278
of the things i was going to ask is

868
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,960
you know what about folks who are

869
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:40,240
looking to use cannabis just for kind of

870
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,000
general wellness or just

871
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,558
general well-being maybe they don't have

872
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,079
a specific condition but

873
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:47,359
you know everyone wants to everyone

874
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,480
wants to feel good everyone wants to

875
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,959
feel better

876
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,120
i imagine that those principles would

877
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,200
hold true for those folks as well

878
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,398
yeah this is a great topic that i'm very

879
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,240
interested in

880
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,398
cannabis for health promotion and

881
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,960
disease prevention you know i feel like

882
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,599
if if you could take almost any field in

883
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,558
medicine

884
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,038
whether it's psychiatry or pain medicine

885
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,519
or neurology or gastroenterology

886
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,200
and take all their the cases that have

887
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,720
failed to respond to all of their

888
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,720
treatments and send them to me and i'm

889
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,720
getting success with 80 to 90

890
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,798
you know if cannabis can be so useful

891
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,880
for all these refractory conditions

892
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,639
what could it do to prevent them what

893
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,399
could it do to keep people healthy what

894
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,000
could it do to help people perform at

895
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:29,599
their best and feel their best

896
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,200
i actually wrote a chapter on this in a

897
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,639
book that's coming out in the next month

898
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,480
or two

899
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,320
that i wrote for physicians and other

900
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,319
clinicians but it's

901
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,678
uh yeah cannabis for health promotion

902
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,839
and disease prevention

903
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,960
i think there's some you know very basic

904
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,798
principles that i'll share with the

905
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,798
listeners here you know number one is

906
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,839
you do not want to build tolerance to

907
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,079
thc

908
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,079
because building tolerance to thc means

909
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,960
you've down regulated your cannabinoid

910
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,439
receptors

911
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,759
and that means that you are undermining

912
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,600
the function of your

913
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,278
system and this is a system that is

914
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,439
there to keep you healthy

915
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:04,720
to respond to injury and to respond to

916
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,840
illness and to keep everything in

917
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,038
balance in the body

918
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:11,119
so so no tolerance to thc um

919
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,119
you know that that's the number one rule

920
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,278
another another rule

921
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,879
or another set of rules has to do with

922
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,119
using cannabis to support

923
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,080
other lifestyle factors that are known

924
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,239
to be healthy

925
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,079
so if you're not sleeping well ask

926
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,919
yourself well how can i use cannabis to

927
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,639
optimize my sleep and that's probably a

928
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,720
whole nother

929
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,640
podcast worth of information there but

930
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
but we have a lot of that info on my

931
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,159
website and people can find that as well

932
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,000
if you're

933
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,000
if you find that cannabis is a nice

934
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,759
adjunct to exercise either because it

935
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,880
makes you look forward to it more and do

936
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:42,720
it more frequently

937
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,320
or if it's because it helps you feel

938
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
like you recover faster

939
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,480
and get ready for the next workout use

940
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,759
cannabis as an adjunct to exercise use

941
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,240
it as an adjunct

942
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,440
to meditation or spiritual practices to

943
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,240
creativity

944
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,880
to socializing which you know it's i

945
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,558
mean

946
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,159
i used to not have to tell people to do

947
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:00,558
that but of course now in this day and

948
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,159
age

949
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,918
you know so many of us are socially

950
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,720
isolated and um

951
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,559
really missing the healing aspect of

952
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,200
those social connections in our life and

953
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,038
i think

954
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,360
uh it's important that cannabis can

955
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,440
really deepen relationships quickly and

956
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,479
help people open up and share and

957
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,798
collaborate

958
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,399
creatively and i think that's that's

959
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:21,278
really essential when it comes to health

960
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:23,119
promotion

961
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,720
and disease prevention and then the

962
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,359
other thing that i want to share is if

963
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,120
you look at

964
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,199
some societies around the world that

965
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,439
have used cannabis for this purpose

966
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,200
it's often the acidic cannabinoids that

967
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,919
they're relying the most on so

968
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,278
cannabis tea is a wonderful tonic you

969
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,880
know think of

970
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,359
think of this as something that you can

971
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,880
do that really has no downside

972
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,558
that's just going to help mitigate

973
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,320
inflammation in the body and

974
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,839
kind of nudge your endocannabinoid

975
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,079
system in the right direction

976
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,678
and so and that's that's a no-brainer

977
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,439
you know almost every morning or about

978
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,600
six days a week because i do take a

979
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,240
cannabis fast one day a week myself

980
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,119
along with um calories and caffeine all

981
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,919
on the same day

982
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,798
but i um i just throw i just throw a

983
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,720
little bit of bud

984
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,798
like maybe the size of a of a pea a

985
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,558
fresh pea throw that in the cup and

986
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,240
you know maybe i'll add another tea bag

987
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,079
maybe i won't pour hot water on it let

988
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,759
it steep for five minutes and drink it

989
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,839
and if you know that you're not very

990
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,599
sensitive to thc you could even eat that

991
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,839
little bud at the end of the cup

992
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,278
you will get some thc in that dose but

993
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,839
it might not be a lot it

994
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,319
kind of depends on how strong the flower

995
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,720
is and

996
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,798
how big of a bud you pinched off but

997
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,159
cannabis tea is a wonderful tonic

998
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:34,319
and so i like people to think about

999
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,360
a lot of my patients as they get better

1000
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,398
and better we kind of

1001
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,879
transition their treatment to you know

1002
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,518
from

1003
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,440
not how can i use this as a crutch to

1004
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,880
manage my life to get on top of my

1005
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,360
health care to you know

1006
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,000
become more self-efficient and then it

1007
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,240
shifts to

1008
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
cannabis as a tonic how can i use this

1009
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,480
to stay healthy and the tea is a big

1010
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,480
part of that

1011
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,319
well that's that's really that's really

1012
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,840
cool and one of the things that stuck

1013
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,519
out to me when you were talking was this

1014
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,079
whole idea of building a tolerance

1015
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,359
to thc and how that could actually

1016
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,199
hinder your body's

1017
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,479
own endocannabinoid system i had never

1018
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,519
really thought of that you know

1019
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,798
folks who you know unfortunately maybe

1020
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,079
uh use a little too much thc could

1021
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,079
actually be doing themselves a

1022
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,278
disservice because you're

1023
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,678
affecting the way that your

1024
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,759
endocannabinoid system is working

1025
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,600
i think that a lot of the listeners well

1026
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,839
first of all i want to say that

1027
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,439
it's okay it's totally okay to overuse

1028
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,599
thc to build tolerance there's no

1029
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,640
judgment that's a useful experience to

1030
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,319
have and i think

1031
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,600
that a lot of the listeners who have had

1032
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,759
that experience where they found

1033
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,079
themselves smoking joints all day

1034
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,599
long for weeks at a time and then they

1035
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,038
realized at the end of a joint wow i

1036
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,158
didn't really feel anything

1037
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:48,640
i bet if you really look at yourself

1038
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,240
when you stopped using it a couple days

1039
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,159
later or a few days later

1040
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,759
i bet you started to feel better now

1041
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,240
this doesn't happen to everyone you know

1042
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,480
about

1043
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,359
somewhere around 50 of heavy cannabis

1044
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,278
smokers

1045
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,439
will experience a withdrawal syndrome

1046
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,679
which is not that strong but it's

1047
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,399
irritability loss of appetite trouble

1048
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,278
sleeping you know things like that but a

1049
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,359
lot of people

1050
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,200
after they stop using it they suddenly

1051
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,158
start to feel like

1052
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,000
normal is the new high you know like wow

1053
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,360
that feels really good i wanna i'm gonna

1054
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,278
feel like that more

1055
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,398
and um and that's a you know i think

1056
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,359
that's an important

1057
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,398
transition point between the crutch and

1058
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,240
the tonic

1059
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,079
you know if you're a cannabis user and

1060
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,079
it really is helping you

1061
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,558
you're likely going to feel a lot better

1062
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:35,278
after you use it i would encourage you

1063
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,960
to watch for when you don't feel better

1064
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,880
after you use it or when you feel

1065
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,480
even a little worse after you use it and

1066
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,919
that's a that's something that

1067
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,120
your body will show you if you pay

1068
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,559
attention and you're honest with

1069
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,918
yourself you'll note that

1070
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:47,599
and that's a really beautiful

1071
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,799
communication from your system

1072
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,398
that it's time to shift your

1073
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:51,359
relationship with cannabis into a

1074
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,558
different mode

1075
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,959
so so watch for that but this um this

1076
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,158
process of regaining our endocannabinoid

1077
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,038
receptors can happen

1078
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,080
rapidly it's been shown in one mri study

1079
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,798
at least in men

1080
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,439
to happen over a period of 48 hours so

1081
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:07,519
if you're

1082
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,039
dabbing or smoking joints all day long

1083
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,480
and you don't feel it at all

1084
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:15,679
you can stop for 48 hours start at

1085
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,599
say a 50 lower dose and you're

1086
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,280
you're gonna feel it and and that's

1087
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,159
that's just the thing like

1088
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,359
how would you like to spend half as much

1089
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,398
money on your medicine

1090
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,838
and feel it either the same or more with

1091
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,918
less side effects like

1092
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,918
it's only upside for that so and that's

1093
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,598
why years ago on healer.com

1094
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,759
we put up this free program called the

1095
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,119
sensitization protocol which really

1096
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,960
holds people's hand and walks them

1097
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,559
through not just those 48 hours

1098
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,480
but i do give a lot of strategies for

1099
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,358
how you can deal with those 48 hours you

1100
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,358
know it's for

1101
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,440
easier for some than others so there's

1102
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,878
exercises and meditations and foods you

1103
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
can eat and all sorts of things you can

1104
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,000
do to

1105
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,720
get through that period and then a guide

1106
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,760
for how to

1107
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,838
very consciously restart

1108
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,160
the cannabis at a lower dose and watch

1109
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,400
what it does for you

1110
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,319
that's excellent and winding down here i

1111
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,800
did want to ask you about

1112
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,160
product variability and how that can

1113
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,880
sort of play into

1114
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,239
finding the right dose like maybe you

1115
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,720
were using a product

1116
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,239
it was you found the right dose it was

1117
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,679
really effective but then

1118
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,838
for whatever reason that product's not

1119
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,759
available at that dispensary anymore

1120
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:22,960
how can that sort of throw everything

1121
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,800
off

1122
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,320
great question so i think there's some

1123
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,839
value in that first of all

1124
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,079
you know for years people have been

1125
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,920
telling me that if i just grew one

1126
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,160
strain in my backyard you know for the

1127
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,159
whole year it seems to not work as well

1128
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,000
as if i grew four and kind of switch

1129
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,358
between them you know for maybe i'll do

1130
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,639
a couple weeks with one in a couple

1131
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,319
weeks with another or

1132
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,000
one in the morning and one in the night

1133
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,800
things like that and so i i

1134
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,199
think to keep well let me say that

1135
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,519
physiology tends not to be static

1136
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,719
you know we really do well with

1137
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,199
fluctuations

1138
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,118
in our system and and you know that's

1139
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:00,159
that's biological life for you

1140
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,960
and so i don't think it makes sense to

1141
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,879
really strive to use the same exact

1142
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,519
cannabis at the same exact dose every

1143
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,920
day for

1144
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,159
a long long period of time now little

1145
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,880
fluctuations are okay skip a dose once

1146
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,279
in a while

1147
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,400
or get a product that's very similar but

1148
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,480
slightly different

1149
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,760
that's that's usually very helpful i had

1150
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,240
a lady yesterday

1151
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,119
who's um in her mid 70s she's using

1152
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,078
cannabis

1153
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,838
for pain and the dispensary sold her the

1154
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,599
same potency product but this one was

1155
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:28,960
hybrid instead of indica

1156
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,800
and she said i don't know why they sold

1157
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,320
me that that you know i i was buying the

1158
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,560
indica every time and i said well

1159
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,240
what did you think you know and she said

1160
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,279
it works but it doesn't seem to work

1161
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:38,959
quite as well

1162
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,880
you know and that's i said well that's a

1163
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,240
fine experiment it's a little bottle

1164
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,160
go back there next time and say the

1165
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,239
indica works better and now you know and

1166
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,078
you know and and that's not a big deal

1167
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,078
what is a big deal in my mind

1168
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,839
is when the label is just way off and

1169
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,240
unfortunately we see this

1170
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,078
so often in cannabis so what if this

1171
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,759
lady goes to the next dispensary and

1172
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,400
because of the label on the first

1173
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,640
product

1174
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,838
she thinks she's a 10 milligram doser

1175
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,759
and she you know she asked the

1176
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,358
dispensary agent how many drops of this

1177
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
is 10 milligrams and whatever they tell

1178
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,159
her

1179
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,000
maybe she's getting 20. i mean this is

1180
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,920
this might sound unusual to listeners

1181
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
but this is not unusual to me

1182
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,119
like this this is happening all the time

1183
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,960
because um

1184
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,400
first of all the testing labs have a lot

1185
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,559
of inconsistencies

1186
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,240
people don't necessarily measure how

1187
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:23,679
many drops are in a milliliter so

1188
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,799
they're just like kind of picking some

1189
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:28,239
number between

1190
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,920
20 and 50 and and saying that that's how

1191
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,598
many and then doing the math there

1192
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,039
a lot of times the labels don't make it

1193
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,880
simple and the patient actually has to

1194
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:35,358
try to bust out a calculator and figure

1195
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,519
out

1196
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,480
milligrams per milliliter and drops per

1197
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:40,880
milliliter and

1198
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,960
you know that's that so um you know

1199
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,280
we've really

1200
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,960
put a lot of attention and time into

1201
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,560
simplifying that for patients with the

1202
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,519
healer line of products both our hemp

1203
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,279
products and our

1204
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,639
thc containing products that we have in

1205
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,960
maine and in maryland

1206
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,759
and we include dosing guides i mean it's

1207
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,760
just

1208
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,839
so often that people are making mistakes

1209
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,480
having to do with either inaccurate

1210
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,400
labeling or misleading or confusing

1211
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,920
labeling of the products so that that's

1212
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,960
where the real pitfall is

1213
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,838
but when it comes to um you know a

1214
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,880
certain preparation being like the one

1215
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:14,559
you know i

1216
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,480
sometimes see that in my patients with

1217
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,440
seizures where

1218
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,280
we can really determine like wow you

1219
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,760
pretty much are getting the same dose of

1220
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,079
cbd or thca that you were getting before

1221
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,160
but

1222
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,160
but really this product isn't working as

1223
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,000
well and the parents are like absolutely

1224
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,239
not so i do see some real

1225
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,920
specificity not in all seizure patients

1226
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,399
but in a few seizure patients

1227
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,760
but in general i think variability is

1228
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,680
okay as long as you're in kind of that

1229
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,720
same range

1230
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,358
right so i guess it must have to be a

1231
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,039
certain

1232
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,519
psychological mindset you need to be

1233
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:49,039
into too is to kind of be open that

1234
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,440
there might be a little variability and

1235
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:54,639
to be able to to roll with that

1236
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,559
oh ben our um yeah i think we've our

1237
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,519
species has really um

1238
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,000
lost its comfort with ambiguity and this

1239
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,759
is a big

1240
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,280
problem you know we all really want to

1241
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,760
pin it down and

1242
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,599
i identify all the discrete you know

1243
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,320
kind of cause and effect relationships

1244
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,240
in our life

1245
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,680
not just with cannabis but with so many

1246
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,000
things and i think it

1247
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,159
that's extremely stressful because we're

1248
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,480
living in such a complex system and we

1249
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,039
are

1250
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,760
we are such a complex system that we

1251
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,719
can't really

1252
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,320
always uh pin down all the discrete

1253
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,838
causes and effects and

1254
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,838
you know i invite the listeners to be

1255
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,599
comfortable with ambiguity whenever it

1256
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,519
comes up in their life and they don't

1257
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,720
that they don't really understand what's

1258
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,358
happening or they can't be

1259
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,159
certain they're getting the right dose

1260
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,000
that's okay

1261
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,159
you know what i tell my patients is that

1262
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,358
if you accidentally take a thousand

1263
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:43,358
times the dose of

1264
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,880
this medicine you know a thousand times

1265
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,400
the dose i'm recommending it's not going

1266
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,320
to kill you it's not going to cause any

1267
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,760
brain damage or organ damage or

1268
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,160
anything else like that you might be

1269
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,480
sick for a day have someone put you in a

1270
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,559
calm reassuring environment and

1271
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,519
you know call me if that happens but

1272
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,440
it's um

1273
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,800
you know people do make mistakes and and

1274
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,679
sometimes there's great lessons that

1275
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,079
come out of that as well

1276
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,960
all right um one last question before i

1277
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,480
let you go

1278
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,119
we talked a lot about having resources

1279
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,199
to help patients with their dosing

1280
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,160
what about physicians or health care

1281
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,239
providers

1282
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,598
who are maybe new to cannabis and want

1283
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,239
to start recommending it to their

1284
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,318
patients

1285
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,759
what sort of resources are available to

1286
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,639
them to help

1287
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,359
to help guide their patients yeah great

1288
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,559
question

1289
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,000
so you know my supreme offering is this

1290
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,679
book that i've been working on for the

1291
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,679
last year and a half it's coming out

1292
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,440
through norton professional and even

1293
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,039
though on major booksellers it says the

1294
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,720
release date is august it's probably

1295
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,239
going to be in the next month or two

1296
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,078
that it's released and that's available

1297
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,679
for pre-order right now so that's

1298
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,160
the best i have to offer you it's called

1299
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,759
handbook of cannabis for clinicians

1300
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,159
now there's some other resources i want

1301
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,400
to point you to one is the society of

1302
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,480
cannabis clinicians it's a great

1303
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,559
membership organization and we just

1304
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,480
released a new curriculum of about 20

1305
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,119
modules that you can take online so

1306
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,240
that's a

1307
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,240
nice resource and then healer.com

1308
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,399
which is my free patient education

1309
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,799
website we also have a paid

1310
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,000
training certification program on there

1311
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,480
which includes

1312
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,159
um kind of bite-sized online modules

1313
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,920
plus a bunch of videos and then a

1314
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,920
monthly webinar

1315
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,358
and the monthly webinar is actually free

1316
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,400
for everyone to attend but in the

1317
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:22,000
training program

1318
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,599
we have all the previous webinars that

1319
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,800
are all time stamps so people can go

1320
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,200
right to a topic

1321
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,560
that's important for them but that was

1322
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,279
originally designed

1323
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,559
for dispensary agents and for caregivers

1324
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,160
and people that were just

1325
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,078
wanting you know kind of lay people that

1326
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,000
we're really wanting to dig in deeper

1327
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,599
but what we found is now we've got 200

1328
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,559
clinicians that are in that program and

1329
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,359
they all love it

1330
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,719
i think because it's it's just kind of

1331
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,039
very concise

1332
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,159
quickly applicable you know that was my

1333
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,000
goal with it is to make

1334
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,440
not not to make this a scientifically

1335
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,519
dense curriculum but to

1336
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,639
empower people to get good results very

1337
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:59,280
quickly so all of my education

1338
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,960
on healer.com i think is empowering even

1339
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,079
even physicians i would say start with

1340
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,440
my patient education

1341
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,119
material maybe that's all you're gonna
