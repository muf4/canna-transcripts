1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,879
thank you thank you very much I

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,319
appreciate and I want to thank for the

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,829
invitation it's a pleasure to be in

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:14,609
California after a short trip of law 20

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:19,140
hours from from Jerusalem and I'll try

6
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:21,750
in my talk if I know how to advance my

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:29,399
slides anybody can show me how to

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:30,810
advance my slides now I think that you

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,460
can point there and it will give you a

10
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:34,469
laser pointer which will show behind you

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:40,189
and I Alston

12
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,189
how many B this is C the top oh yeah

13
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:51,689
okay I'll try to present an overview of

14
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,420
things that are happening in the

15
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:56,759
cannabinoid field for for me for my

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,539
group it has been quite a few years as a

17
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:03,978
matter of fact as one mentioned before

18
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:06,299
we started work in the early 1960s I

19
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:11,079
believe that many of you were not born

20
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:14,189
there and thanks

21
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,188
[Music]

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,600
when we started world there was

23
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:30,120
absolutely no interest as a matter of

24
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,849
fact when I asked for a grant from NIH

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,939
and NIH had a lot of money that time and

26
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,459
gave a lot of grants they told me and I

27
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,590
knew the people there the one many of

28
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,329
them outstanding scientist when you have

29
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,150
something more relevant to the u.s.

30
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,519
contact us nobody smokes marijuana it's

31
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,060
something that's being used in in Mexico

32
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,369
well a year later two years later

33
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,500
they're pharmacologist came back and I

34
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,469
asked him what happened somebody

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,170
important maybe a senator had approached

36
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:06,478
him and had asked whether marijuana

37
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:10,500
destroys the mind the brain apparently

38
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,060
his son had been smoked seen smoking pot

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,599
and he wanted to know what's going on

40
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,729
well things have changed since then

41
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,579
nature probably the one of the most

42
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:23,729
important scientific journals nature

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,630
published last year for reviews and this

44
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:30,810
is our review here you can see the brain

45
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:35,250
and the cannabis and all the time we

46
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:38,129
have additional information and the

47
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,449
reason for that is in a medical site at

48
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,449
least that

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,879
it is known today that modulating

50
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,820
endocannabinoid activity may have

51
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,370
therapeutic potential in almost all

52
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:57,319
diseases affecting humans and this was

53
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,539
published this was in a review by two

54
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:03,539
scientists at NIH and while I'm not sure

55
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:06,419
that this is absolutely true affecting

56
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:08,609
all diseases affecting humans there is

57
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,669
no doubt that quite a lot of diseases

58
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,040
are affected and therefore there is a

59
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:16,109
lot of interest that contrary to what

60
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:19,709
happened as I told you a few years

61
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,010
before but let's go back and look at

62
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,379
some of them interest in cannabis in my

63
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,179
area of the world in the Middle East it

64
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,459
was used for thousands of years and this

65
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,000
is something that the Assyrians had and

66
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:37,640
they had three types of they use it in

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,770
three ways they used it as a

68
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:43,229
recreational drug if you wish in modern

69
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,080
terms and they call that Gans Eagle knew

70
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:48,479
they used it apparently for neurological

71
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,180
diseases and they call that as a low and

72
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:56,819
they apparently it was also part of

73
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:59,730
their religion and this went on and on

74
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:03,449
for quite a lot of years and this is

75
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:05,549
something from dr. Reynolds who was the

76
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:09,238
personal physician of Queen Victoria

77
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:12,480
Queen Victoria had severe migraines and

78
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,759
he used to bring cannabis from India

79
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,649
apparently European cannabis was not

80
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,738
good enough he was to bring cannabis

81
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:22,560
from India for migraines and he didn't

82
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:26,329
mention her name in her articles but it

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:31,709
was well known the describe he was

84
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:34,800
actually involved when we speak today of

85
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:37,079
cannabis most people will think of the

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,918
plant alone and the compounds that are

87
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:44,849
found in the plant and of course speak

88
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:48,089
about those but it is not so simple and

89
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:51,390
things have developed quite rapidly over

90
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:54,389
the last twenty years and I can see

91
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,089
three phases of cannabinoid research

92
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:56,709
when

93
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:59,259
them has to do with the plant the height

94
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:02,198
of cannabinoid research the second one

95
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:06,389
has to do with the endogenous

96
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:09,430
cannabinoids that we and Omer millions

97
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:12,340
produce an endermite and two AG two

98
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,668
compounds that we discovered in the 90s

99
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:19,029
and since then there has been a lot of

100
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:22,478
interest at least amongst many

101
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:24,759
scientists of compounds that we produce

102
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,039
mammalians produce they're about the

103
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,409
hundreds of them they are like Ananda

104
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,229
mite inanimate is a relatively simple

105
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,450
compound a fatty acid bound to an amino

106
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:37,259
acid or an amino acid derivative and

107
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,819
there are about a hundred compounds and

108
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:42,039
many of these at least those that have

109
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,620
been investigated are of major

110
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,510
importance since I don't believe that

111
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,288
the body makes compound because it has

112
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:52,120
nothing else to do so we have about the

113
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:55,180
hundred compounds and these are being

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,478
investigated and I'll spend a part of my

115
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,160
talk on these and these compounds so

116
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:08,349
let's start with the phyto cannabinoid

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:12,060
research I was surprised to find out in

118
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,379
the early 60s when I started work that a

119
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,110
country to morphine which had been

120
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:20,379
isolated 100 years previously from opium

121
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,879
and country to cocaine the cannabinoid

122
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,918
chemistry was not well known although

123
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,740
some excellent chemists had worked on

124
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,560
that and this is because it turned out

125
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,550
that there is a huge number of

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,410
cannabinoids in the plant and the

127
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,288
techniques were probably not available

128
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:39,070
in the 30s and 40s to identify these

129
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:43,990
compounds and so we went back I got

130
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:47,649
without any major administrative problem

131
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,348
Salah got five kilograms of hashish your

132
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:53,129
Lebanese hash from the police and we

133
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:56,959
started looking at cannabinoids there

134
00:06:53,129 --> 00:07:00,529
incidentally the

135
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:04,599
the hashish I got was smuggled hashes

136
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:08,719
which Lebanese and Israelis collaborated

137
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:11,479
to get through through the frontier but

138
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:17,000
only part of it is being caught and and

139
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:19,189
that came to my lap ultimately and we

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,668
started isolating the materials there

141
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:25,819
and we were able to isolate about dozen

142
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:27,740
compounds most of them unknown and all

143
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,709
of them for those of you who remember

144
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,900
your high school chemistry the right

145
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,489
hand side of the molecule is mole as the

146
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,948
same now we know there's some

147
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,780
differences but at that time that we

148
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:41,689
found out that all the compounds we

149
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:43,549
identified had the right hand side the

150
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:46,098
aromatic part of the molecule if you

151
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,020
wish the same and the differences were

152
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:51,079
only in the left hand side of the

153
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:55,069
molecule which is a terpene and these

154
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:58,069
modifications led to a huge number of

155
00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:00,348
compounds and they are identified at

156
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:04,879
least some of them identified here can

157
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:08,889
be Jarrell cannot be no THC etc etc but

158
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:14,560
the two most important compounds were

159
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:16,788
CBD cannabidiol and THC which we

160
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,360
elucidated the structure of cannabidiol

161
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:22,579
which had been which had been isolated

162
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,310
well way back in the 30s but the

163
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:28,279
structure was unknown and we published

164
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:31,908
that 1963 that was our first paper on

165
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,679
cannabis and THC we were able I believe

166
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:36,620
for the first time to isolate in a pure

167
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,809
form and to elucidate its structure and

168
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,200
its absolute configuration the way it

169
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:45,259
stays in the same space and these things

170
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,190
two compounds are the two compounds that

171
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:52,159
him that have been investigated most

172
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,170
thoroughly and there is still quite a

173
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,549
lot of work and some of the additional

174
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:57,649
compounds we don't know enough about

175
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:59,838
Canobie Jarrow we don't know enough

176
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:02,629
about cannabis roaming we certainly know

177
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,120
almost nothing about cannabis iclal and

178
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,730
so on and so forth so it is worth doing

179
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,269
but they the all the other compounds to

180
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,360
the best of my knowledge except THC do

181
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,879
not bind to the cannabinoid receptors

182
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,210
and I'll have a few words to say about

183
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:24,610
but with cannabis everything is

184
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:27,430
complicated we turned out that THC CBD

185
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,500
all the other compounds are not actually

186
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:34,120
natural products they're secondary

187
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:40,049
products they're made in the plant from

188
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:43,480
their assets the plant produces CBD acid

189
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:45,549
THC as it can be general acid these

190
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,000
compounds are not stable and they

191
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:51,009
convert on the plant itself or later

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,500
they convert into their neutral

193
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:56,830
compounds so cannabidiol acid converts

194
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:00,639
into the cannabidiol in DD acid converts

195
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:03,160
into THC now there isn't much work on

196
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,409
the acids because they are not stable

197
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:08,169
and scientists don't like to work with

198
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:10,259
unstable compounds because one doesn't

199
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:13,240
know whether the results are due to the

200
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:18,700
starting material to the acid so in this

201
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:21,610
case all to to those compounds at the

202
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,129
the that are derivatives of Canobie

203
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,460
diodes so there is not enough work on

204
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:29,350
the cannabinoid acid so we thought over

205
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:33,310
the last few years that it's worthwhile

206
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:36,519
to stabilize the acids and then maybe

207
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:39,279
look at their activities and indeed over

208
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:41,699
as I mentioned over the last few years

209
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,889
we have been working particularly and

210
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,530
cannabidiol ik acid which we stabilized

211
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:50,980
by converting it into the maccalister

212
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:55,740
and this compound is stable and this

213
00:10:50,980 --> 00:11:00,460
compound apparently to a certain extent

214
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:04,450
parallels the activity of CBD in some

215
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,970
cases it's more active and we have

216
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,730
already published several papers around

217
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,670
the activity of this particular compound

218
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,060
and we are going to hear a few lectures

219
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:18,819
on this compound as work in this field

220
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:21,250
is being supported by one of the two

221
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,920
groups it's organizing this meeting EPM

222
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,019
and

223
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:29,688
I believe that after we know more about

224
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:33,350
CBD acid methyl ester it will

225
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:36,409
I hope hopefully become a drug what do

226
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,249
we know about the cannabidiol ik acid

227
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:40,058
methyl ester

228
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:44,269
well we found and published that it's

229
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:47,019
suppresses nausea as you know cancer

230
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:50,239
chemotherapy does cause nausea and

231
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:52,959
sometimes most most unpleasant it

232
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:55,879
suppresses nausea and it suppresses

233
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:59,118
anxiety in rats we don't know whether it

234
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,798
suppresses the anxiety in humans because

235
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:04,809
it has never been given to it human

236
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:07,308
never administered to a human and we are

237
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:12,828
neither rats no mice so we don't know

238
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:16,428
but this particular compound was found

239
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:19,729
that it enhances serotonin activation as

240
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:22,338
all of you know serotonin dopamine these

241
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,649
are the two major neurotransmitters and

242
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:27,799
there are at most importance in a large

243
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:31,360
number of diseases so this is probably

244
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:35,480
one of the mechanisms that the acids and

245
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,959
the neutral compounds act in any case

246
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,879
this compound failure 580 the methyl

247
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:45,498
ester was found to lower anxiety and

248
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,999
quite recently we also found that it

249
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:53,509
lowers again in animals lowers

250
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:55,790
depression again we are not we never say

251
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:58,579
a hundred percent show for the

252
00:12:55,789 --> 00:13:01,188
depression in animals parallels

253
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:03,078
depression in humans I believe that this

254
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:08,448
is so so I'm looking forward to see

255
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:11,479
whether the methyl ester will suppress

256
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:15,258
anxiety and depression in humans and I

257
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,538
hope that the next meeting here the next

258
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:21,409
few meetings here we'll hear a lot about

259
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:23,509
these these compounds so before I go

260
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:27,360
into some detail I want to say a few

261
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:29,430
words about an effect which we observed

262
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,879
quite a few years ago we called it out

263
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:35,549
to Raja Peck and we found it compounds

264
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,700
that the present can cannabis and do not

265
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:42,359
have any significant cannabinoid

266
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,310
activity by themselves effect that

267
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,620
tivity of the cannabinoids of the plant

268
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:48,838
that they affect the activity of the CBD

269
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,299
they affect the activity of THC we

270
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,600
publish that there are a lot of papers

271
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:56,699
that refer to a durant or are saying

272
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,509
patients prefer to use a cannabis

273
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:03,570
extract rather than pure THC or CBD

274
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,240
because of non-food artifact this may or

275
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:08,550
may not be fully correct but there is

276
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,200
surprisingly very little work on down to

277
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:15,750
russia effect by itself we have a huge

278
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,329
number of therapies you we have lavender

279
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:23,070
to have other compounds in cannabis and

280
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:27,000
we still do not know how these compounds

281
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:28,950
or who which are these compounds and the

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,828
long list of terpenoids and flavonoids

283
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:34,379
that cause the entourage effect and i

284
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:37,649
hope again that the more work will be

285
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:40,439
done on the entourage effect because it

286
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:45,208
is an important observation i believe

287
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:47,850
any does not really answer all the

288
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:50,879
questions we have but it is a major

289
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:54,180
biological importance so let me save you

290
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,570
in a few words about the effects of THC

291
00:14:54,179 --> 00:15:00,088
that they have been published their well

292
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:04,110
known so i will not spend much time and

293
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:06,510
THC just a few the major effect we know

294
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:12,690
that it affected pain nausea and

295
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:16,198
vomiting sleep a lot of patients report

296
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:19,470
that sleep allowing them to go to sleep

297
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:24,509
is the major effect that they can see

298
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:27,149
and it lowers appetite and again as we

299
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:30,360
all know at low doses it may cause these

300
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:34,740
effects but if we go to higher doses

301
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:39,200
especially people that have not used at

302
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,070
Cannabis THC previously if they use

303
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,750
initially high doses

304
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,500
many of the young mostly young people

305
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,440
end up in the psychiatry department with

306
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,679
an attack and indeed I have found out

307
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,500
that in hospital I'm associated with the

308
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,719
Medical Faculty of the Hebrew University

309
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,820
the psychiatrists strongly opposed to

310
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,240
cannabis and the reason is that they see

311
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:06,420
almost every day one or two young people

312
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,519
getting being brought to the hospital

313
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:11,569
with an attack because they started

314
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:16,049
using initially large amounts of

315
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:19,500
cannabis a large amount of THC which of

316
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:21,439
course can cause a psychiatric attack

317
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,320
[Music]

318
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,950
most recently we have seen that THC

319
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,900
again it low doses can cause can lower

320
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:34,460
depression and of course many patients

321
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:38,929
say so but again we have a biphasic

322
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:42,180
effect here low doses we definitely see

323
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:44,429
antidepressant effects but at higher

324
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:47,370
doses we don't hire those as we don't

325
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:49,469
the effect the other cannot be noise do

326
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,830
the same but it seems that they do that

327
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:57,980
with much higher doses and some years

328
00:16:52,830 --> 00:17:02,639
ago we looked at the possibility that

329
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:05,160
THC causes is effective in post trauma

330
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,319
of course a lot of post trauma patients

331
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,190
use cannabis and we wanted to know

332
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:14,429
whether this is true or not so we did a

333
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:18,180
small clinical trial and we found the

334
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:19,860
test most definitely it affects most of

335
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,560
the symptoms of post trauma

336
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:27,479
in in patients and we had patients that

337
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:30,210
some of them were had been were soldiers

338
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:34,049
previously and had seen people around

339
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,470
them get hurt there were a few women

340
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:39,750
that had been raped there were a few

341
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,690
people that had been in traffic accident

342
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,730
so we had patients of all types and yes

343
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,580
most Devin

344
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:49,069
it helped with the post-trauma and I

345
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:50,898
hope that there will be a much larger

346
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:54,398
trial because a lot of patience as you

347
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:58,009
know a lot of post trauma patients use

348
00:17:54,398 --> 00:18:00,888
cannabis and we really have to know more

349
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:04,028
but we don't have enough clinical trials

350
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:07,099
and again I want to stress we badly need

351
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:11,298
clinical trials this is the one thing

352
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:15,439
that physicians insist on rightly so

353
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:18,230
they can base their work on clinical

354
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,470
trials and we don't have clinical trials

355
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,750
for most of the diseases that are well

356
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:28,069
known to be affected by cannabinoids I

357
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:31,690
have not seen yet a major clinical trial

358
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:34,609
in cancer any cancer and we know that

359
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:38,720
some cancer affected more some cancer

360
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:45,349
effected less but we don't have the data

361
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:48,740
so I strongly ask the clinicians here

362
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:51,888
please try to go ahead with modern

363
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:54,079
clinical trials in most of the diseases

364
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:56,619
that we're speaking about certainly in

365
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,619
cancer

366
00:18:58,308 --> 00:19:06,178
well what about CBD well of course CBD

367
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,240
is well known it I was surprised to see

368
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:11,759
that people think that CBD will be used

369
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,089
to the extent of twenty five billion

370
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,519
dollars a year within the next few years

371
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:20,939
in the US alone it may be an

372
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,668
exaggeration after all but I'll say a

373
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:27,120
few words about the effects of CBD we

374
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:30,900
and many others had seen in animals that

375
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,699
CBD pure CBD effects epilepsy so we did

376
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,370
a clinical trial

377
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,740
as you can see nine we published it in

378
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:41,000
nineteen eighty almost forty years ago

379
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,370
and this was done in collaboration with

380
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,980
my colleagues in Sao Paulo in Brazil and

381
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:53,039
we supplied it with almost 500 grams of

382
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:57,929
cannabis of CBD we had isolated from

383
00:19:53,039 --> 00:20:01,558
cannabis and that they gave relatively

384
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:03,630
high doses 200 milligrams a day to

385
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:05,879
epileptic patients that nothing else was

386
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,640
helping them and they found that yes

387
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,750
indeed it is most definitely a very

388
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,850
helpful drug it was done on a small

389
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:18,390
number of patients but even so that

390
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:20,639
should have meant at that time that yes

391
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,100
here we have a drug that can help with

392
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,280
the epilepsy well what happened to us

393
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:29,789
nothing nobody was interested so for

394
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:35,129
nearly 30 years nobody used cannabidiol

395
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:38,009
in epilepsy but in the u.s. parents saw

396
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:41,760
that cannabis and the plant cannabis

397
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:45,058
that contains the high doses of CBD is

398
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:48,720
indeed helpful especially in a children

399
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:51,450
that had epileptic attacks sometimes

400
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,429
twenty to thirty epileptic attacks a day

401
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,440
this was the only thing that helped him

402
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:58,980
so they started to going to one of the

403
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,910
stage that cannabis was legal and there

404
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,829
was a lot of public pressure and the US

405
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:07,740
Food and Drug Administration ultimately

406
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:08,480
approved a clinical trial until the then

407
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,069
I

408
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,349
don't believe that there was any major

409
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:17,298
clinical crown with cannabinoids in the

410
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:20,869
US well as we know the trial was a large

411
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:23,900
the a la relatively large trial was very

412
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:27,369
successful in that today CBD the name of

413
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:31,610
epidural X is being used as an anti

414
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:36,109
epileptic drug did we have to wait 30

415
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:38,240
years now we could have helped children

416
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:41,928
in particular children over these 30

417
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:46,190
years having 20 to 30 epileptic attacks

418
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:49,280
a day really means that the child of

419
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:51,500
this time cannot develop we ruined a

420
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:55,428
child we could have helped maybe

421
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,048
thousands of children we didn't and I'm

422
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:58,850
under the impression that this is what's

423
00:21:57,048 --> 00:22:04,940
happening with quite a few of the other

424
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:07,039
diseases in one field we have pretty

425
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,370
good information and this is the

426
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:14,558
graft-versus-host disease we and others

427
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:17,298
had found that cannabidiol works in

428
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:20,690
autoimmune diseases namely diseases in

429
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:23,900
which the body attacks itself the reason

430
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:27,620
why does that quite a few but this is

431
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,870
the ultimate fact the body attacks

432
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:31,548
itself in many autoimmune diseases I've

433
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:35,000
been told that there are about 80 of

434
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:38,359
these but ten are pretty well-known and

435
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,759
serious and a colleague of mine and a

436
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:44,659
doctor yet sure on the thought that

437
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,720
maybe he should try cannot be dialed in

438
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:49,190
something that is closely related to

439
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,179
autoimmune disease namely in certain

440
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:56,990
cancer cases there is a bone marrow

441
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:59,390
transplant and the body doesn't like

442
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,400
that and the transplant doesn't like the

443
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,250
body and they attack each other and the

444
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,070
patient is sick at sometimes very sick

445
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:10,339
if this is a kind of an outer immune

446
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:13,428
disease then maybe cannabidiol will be

447
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:16,369
helpful and indeed he tried pretty high

448
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:17,509
doses about 300 milligrams a day of

449
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:20,178
cannabidiol

450
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:23,269
gave it to these patients and indeed

451
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:26,778
he helped him he helped most of the

452
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:31,788
patients here the resolve that he he had

453
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:35,479
he had about a hundred controls and 46%

454
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:38,450
of these had a mild attack a relatively

455
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:41,989
mild attack went ten percent have had a

456
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:48,909
very serious attack when those that got

457
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:51,829
CBD only 12% had unpleasant symptoms and

458
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:54,169
out of those that praevia mean the

459
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:58,158
serious patients which previously were

460
00:23:54,169 --> 00:24:04,450
10% went down to 5% so now there

461
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:07,759
cannabidiol and GVHD is in the I think

462
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:10,038
third phase investigation and I

463
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,579
sincerely hope that it will become a

464
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:16,158
drug within the next few years and again

465
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:18,918
I hope that it will be possible to help

466
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,409
quite a lot of patients

467
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:27,109
the third example I want to give his

468
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:29,778
opinion we had done a small trial of CBD

469
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:31,999
high doses in schizophrenia in Brazil

470
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:34,368
many years ago and it was quite

471
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:37,038
successful but it was not taken up and

472
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:40,009
it was just an interesting paper in the

473
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,989
literature of an optimum so but in in

474
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:45,979
Germany lévesque a doctor Larry Cain did

475
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:52,970
a major clinical trial and he found that

476
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:56,028
indeed CBD was an extremely a it was a

477
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:58,368
very good anti schizophrenia drug he

478
00:24:56,028 --> 00:25:01,069
compared it to another drug that was

479
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:04,848
being widely used and both drugs were

480
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:08,028
active but the activity of the drugs as

481
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:11,148
presently being used had a lot of side

482
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:15,398
effects CBD as we know does not cause

483
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:19,638
side effect so here we have a drug that

484
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:22,638
apparently helps a lot with which his

485
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:26,558
opinion and he so and this seems to be

486
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:30,789
the mechanism CBD and Hanson and amide

487
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:33,940
levels in the body so maybe this is the

488
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:35,379
the way it works I'm not sure at the

489
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,120
moment we don't have additional

490
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,090
information but this is what's happening

491
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:42,849
and yet although the paper was published

492
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:45,849
to seven years ago it is still not being

493
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:48,129
used in schizophrenia again are we

494
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:51,219
missing something we don't have enough

495
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:54,000
data and obviously psychiatrists will

496
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,460
not be using CBD in schizophrenia

497
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,759
without additional data we may be losing

498
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:03,279
something important again please those

499
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:06,750
of you if there are any psychiatrists

500
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,910
here try to repeat and try to enhance

501
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:12,819
the work that was published by Olivier

502
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:16,360
and then by others later on and we need

503
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:19,419
the data now Levesque I found that when

504
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:24,939
canopy Diane was compared to the drug

505
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:29,289
that was used quite a bit I me so pride

506
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,630
it caused less weight gain which I miss

507
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:35,440
or kryder's the causes there were no

508
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:38,050
changes in hormonal in hormones and

509
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,000
there were few extra pyramid pyramidal

510
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:42,519
syndromes and that means that there were

511
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,470
less muscle spasms there was less

512
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:47,109
slowness of movement there was less

513
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:51,910
tremor and there were there were less

514
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:54,490
irregular jerkey more a movement so what

515
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:59,200
I'm trying to say here we have a drug

516
00:26:54,490 --> 00:27:02,920
which possibly quite possibly acts well

517
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,980
on schizophrenia and we are speaking

518
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,980
about a 1% of the population which has

519
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,200
schizophrenia and a large part of this

520
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:15,009
population does not work cannot work

521
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:20,680
cannot study it is to a certain extent

522
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:22,869
lost we can help I hope and I want to

523
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,810
mention speaking of the cannabinoids on

524
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:29,379
the plant cannabinoids again if another

525
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:32,319
out emu disease diabetes type one it is

526
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,260
an autoimmune disease and we have a good

527
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:38,589
model in animals so we try to see

528
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:42,879
whether can it be dialed helps with that

529
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:45,819
and in the diabetes type 1 the body

530
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,350
destroys the cells that produce insulin

531
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:53,200
and indeed those mice that were not

532
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:56,230
treated with CBD up a certain a period

533
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,440
of time lost most of the cells that

534
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:04,089
produce insulin while those that was CBD

535
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:09,340
treated 77 percent of the cells remained

536
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:13,658
intact we badly need new diabetes type 1

537
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:14,889
drugs but it has never been tested in

538
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,620
the clinic

539
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:20,919
well schizophrenia at least we have one

540
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:23,859
or two clinical trials with diabetes

541
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:30,940
type 1 we don't have a single one why I

542
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:35,379
have no idea now if we speak of the

543
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:37,808
mechanisms of CBD here we have a major

544
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,880
problem it seems to bind to a lot of

545
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:43,269
receptors it it has all kinds of

546
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,399
mechanism at the moment I prefer this

547
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:47,908
mechanism picture was published recently

548
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:51,158
that CBD

549
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:54,278
causes an increase in certain cells that

550
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:58,539
are called MD SC cells and these cells

551
00:28:54,278 --> 00:29:02,048
are known to suppress another type of

552
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:04,990
cells that cause inflammation

553
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:07,569
they're called cd4 T cells well this is

554
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:10,089
correct or not whether this is the only

555
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:12,220
mechanism I don't know but it seems to

556
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:16,028
me to make sense

557
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,850
cannabidiol seems to cause lowering of

558
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:20,859
the activity of these cd4 T cells will

559
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:23,589
have to wait over the next few years to

560
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:27,788
find out whether this is true or true in

561
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:30,548
all cases only in some cases now many of

562
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:34,538
the drugs that we have on the market are

563
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:37,359
not natural products natural products as

564
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:39,700
they appear there are derivatives

565
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,589
you cannot buy in you cannot buy

566
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,509
penicillin in the drugstore the

567
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:46,209
penicillin is not a drug

568
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:48,250
derivatives of penicillin are drugs the

569
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,490
same is true for cortisone you cannot

570
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:53,740
buy the hormone cortisone in a in a drug

571
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,798
store you can buy prednisone or

572
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:00,028
derivatives of cortisone so I think that

573
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:02,679
this may happen to a certain extent

574
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:05,159
which cannot be dialed and related

575
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,840
compounds and indeed if we take

576
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:10,840
cannabidiol and make a small change with

577
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:14,138
a fluorine atom on the canape diode it

578
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:16,148
is more active than cannot be diodes

579
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:18,879
itself and as I mentioned before the

580
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:21,219
acid the methyl esters of the acids do

581
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,700
the same and chances are that we shall

582
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:28,089
have within the next 10 15 years on the

583
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,269
market both cannabis the plant materials

584
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:33,579
and derivatives like the fluorine from

585
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:36,759
mount rack the methyl esters and so on

586
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:40,028
which is not a bad situation because

587
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:44,648
patients will be able to choose whatever

588
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:47,679
they believe is best for them now I

589
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:54,219
would up till now I talked about face

590
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:59,759
the a plant face of the cannabis it

591
00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:02,470
started to change when the mechanism was

592
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:05,200
there was research on the mechanism in

593
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:09,850
the 80s namely almost 20 years after the

594
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,429
cancer cannabinoids were identified an

595
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:14,379
American group are in Howlett discovered

596
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:16,899
that there is a receptor and this

597
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,450
receptor which is a specific one is

598
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:22,058
found in those areas of the brain that

599
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:24,850
are quite typical for cannabinoid for

600
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:26,888
THC effect those areas of the brain that

601
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,959
have to do with movement control with

602
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:33,759
coordination learning and memory a

603
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:38,919
cognitive function and so on so here we

604
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:40,869
had a opening to the mechanism by having

605
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:43,269
a receptor and today we know that we

606
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:46,500
have two receptors but receptors don't

607
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:49,049
exist in the body because

608
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,170
there is a plant out there otherwise

609
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:54,359
we'll have millions of receptors

610
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:57,900
receptors exist because we produce

611
00:31:54,359 --> 00:32:00,750
compounds that bind that stimulate or

612
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,880
inhibit these receptors and so we went

613
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,549
ahead looking for the compound the

614
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,710
natural compounds that do that and how

615
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:10,589
does the one do something like that well

616
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:13,410
to those of you that interested in the

617
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:16,470
chemical part we take THC for example

618
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,240
put on a treat your hat on and on it and

619
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:24,660
the compound is still very active and

620
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:28,140
then we bind this tritium label THC to

621
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:30,300
to the receptor and they and then start

622
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,580
to look at the areas of the brain that

623
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:35,819
were that also want to bind to the

624
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:38,009
receptor and doing so they kick out the

625
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:40,799
labeled material and we can measure the

626
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:44,579
labeled material that has been kicked

627
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:49,139
out from its binding to to the receptor

628
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:51,899
so there by this simple matter a way of

629
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,360
doing it it takes only triple years and

630
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,170
a few PhD students and quite a lot

631
00:32:54,359 --> 00:33:00,479
further we were able to identify two

632
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:02,940
compounds one of them we call the nand

633
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,309
amide and the other one to AG and these

634
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,430
compounds are essentially the

635
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:11,789
cannabinoids of our body they are

636
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:16,259
chemically completely different than THC

637
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:20,730
but their activity is essentially the

638
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:23,250
same THC mimics the activity of the

639
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:28,799
compound that we make the compounds and

640
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:30,359
and by the end and to AG and there are

641
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,389
of course some differences these

642
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:36,629
compounds are made in the body when and

643
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,790
where needed particularly and and abite

644
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:40,860
is not present in large amounts in the

645
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:45,720
bodies present in very small amounts but

646
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:49,259
it is synthesized by the body when and

647
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,329
where needed it acts and then the body

648
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:55,440
breaks it down essentially immediately

649
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:58,740
so we don't see the effects that are so

650
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,920
well with known with THC as THC stays in

651
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,650
the body for

652
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:08,340
quite a long time so as here we have two

653
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:10,480
neuro transmitters novel

654
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,760
neurotransmitters I will of course not

655
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,820
going to the biochemistry but contrary

656
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,310
to most of the other neurotransmitters

657
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,870
day as I said are not present in the

658
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:22,480
body in large amounts

659
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:26,440
they are present in the nerve the nerve

660
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:31,329
is not just a wire going from from my

661
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:33,010
hand to my brain there blue breaks in

662
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:39,639
the middle so the body can regulate it

663
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:42,100
and these scientist Hine axis and Ananda

664
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,379
might into a geophone in the post

665
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:47,799
synapse I mean the part of the brain

666
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:50,289
it's after a break and if they go out

667
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,650
from the post synaptic every synapse

668
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:58,690
they activate the receptor and then they

669
00:34:53,650 --> 00:35:00,849
affect the formation of the release of

670
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,820
other neurotransmitters so what I'm

671
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:07,210
saying in short is that these compounds

672
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:10,360
and THC also act not only by themselves

673
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:12,820
but they also act by regulating other

674
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,970
neurotransmitters and this is one of the

675
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,760
reasons why we say so we see so many

676
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:20,799
effects by both THC and the endogenous

677
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,810
cannabinoids so the endogenous

678
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,360
cannabinoids an animai tend to AG very

679
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:30,940
very important and interesting compounds

680
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,030
but again because of all kinds of legal

681
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:37,510
problems they have never been

682
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:40,450
administered to a human that's quite

683
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,850
frankly outrageous when insulin was

684
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:45,460
discovered almost a hundred years ago it

685
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:47,619
was given to humans within a couple of

686
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,199
months and became a drug within a year

687
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:52,750
or so an excellent drug insulin

688
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:56,919
derivatives of insulin time being used

689
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:59,230
hundred years after discovery Ananda

690
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,920
might into AG which were discovered in

691
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,719
the mid 90s by our group have never been

692
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,599
given to a human who do they're not

693
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:09,730
toxic they do not cause any major side

694
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,759
effect but because of the legal

695
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:16,240
situation nobody has

696
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,960
given them to a human I have known no

697
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,959
solution to that

698
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:25,690
what is the endocannabinoid system now I

699
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:28,989
mentioned that we have two receptors cb1

700
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,059
and cb2 activation of the cb1 causes the

701
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:34,389
well-known cannabis effects the

702
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:37,480
activation of CB 2 is elite to

703
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:41,109
essentially two protective actions it is

704
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,960
kind of a receptor that parallels the

705
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:45,670
immune system it helps in a large number

706
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,199
of disease states and I'll say a few

707
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,420
words later then

708
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:53,759
then endocannabinoid system contains a

709
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:56,740
random item - eg the enzymes that

710
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,780
synthesize these compounds the enzymes

711
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:00,669
break down these compounds and quite a

712
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,480
few companies are working on these

713
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:07,269
enzymes because they can enhance the

714
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:10,329
presence of fernanda might let's say by

715
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:12,250
blocking the enzymes that destroy these

716
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:19,569
compounds that metabolize these

717
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:22,000
compounds and so i expect that a few new

718
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:25,150
drugs will be available in the market

719
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,840
within the next 5-10 years because this

720
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:31,389
compound we can affect the levels of

721
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,610
fernanda might and the levels of - AG by

722
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:36,279
playing around with the enzymes that

723
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:39,130
synthesize them all the enzymes that

724
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,350
break them down not directly not giving

725
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,829
an animai directly not giving even a

726
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:47,500
derivative in under by directly but by

727
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:52,059
playing around with their they're being

728
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:55,579
built up or destroyed now

729
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:57,860
well a lot of scientists have looked

730
00:37:55,579 --> 00:38:03,170
into the activity Fernanda might've 2ag

731
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:05,930
there about 6,000 publications that have

732
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:09,019
to do with the nanomite and to AG and

733
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:15,049
today we have quite a big list of

734
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:17,690
compounds that of physiological state

735
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:21,700
that are affected by an and I might into

736
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:24,170
AG and here is a alphabetical list and

737
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:28,149
starting with anxiety in blood pressure

738
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:30,710
and immune system etc etc if I had a

739
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:35,360
full list it will take another two three

740
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:39,289
slides so here we have system of major

741
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:42,440
major importance and I have no doubt

742
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:46,190
that within the next few years we shall

743
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,349
see many more papers in addition to the

744
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,960
about six thousand papers that have been

745
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:57,650
published we'll see many more papers and

746
00:38:50,960 --> 00:39:00,289
this work open to us Oh clear to us many

747
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:03,430
of the physiological problems that we

748
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:09,259
know exist but we have not been able to

749
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:12,259
do to show but to understand how they

750
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:16,190
happen now I will give just one example

751
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:19,600
of a word that I did with one of my

752
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:25,090
colleagues professor of shahe me

753
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:28,759
she's the specialist in brain trauma and

754
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:31,070
we wanted to know what happens with the

755
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,300
endocannabinoid system in brain trauma

756
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:40,550
so she caused brain trauma mice and we

757
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:44,090
found that the two AG in the brain goes

758
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:47,060
up tremendously the 2h is the red thing

759
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,370
that you see in the middle if you could

760
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:51,049
see the C then compare it to the

761
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:55,009
controls you see that there is

762
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:58,010
enhancement very very potent enhancement

763
00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:01,510
of 2 AG levels in the brain after brain

764
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:03,300
trauma is that because we have caused

765
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:05,400
brain damage in the

766
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:08,900
rain doesn't know what it does or is it

767
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,730
a reaction of the brain kind of a

768
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,280
protective reaction if you wish so we

769
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:17,880
sit aside a large amount of 2ag and gave

770
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,280
them to mice that had undergone brain

771
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,309
trauma and compared them to mice it had

772
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:27,769
not undergone brain trauma and we found

773
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:32,340
that the two AG lowest by 50% the

774
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:35,340
infarct volume in the brain the in fact

775
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:39,059
was not a very strong one it was it

776
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:42,300
causes a certain amount of damage but it

777
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:45,420
could be compared so we saw that we most

778
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:48,660
definitely the brain reacts to the

779
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:53,070
damage by producing two AG and lowering

780
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:54,960
the damage again we see quite a lot of

781
00:40:53,070 --> 00:41:00,180
people with brain damage

782
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:03,030
maybe maybe two AG is a good protective

783
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:06,210
compound protective drug if you wish but

784
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:10,830
again nothing has been done in this area

785
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:12,690
now I mentioned to the doctor Swami whom

786
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:14,969
I collaborate I still collaborate in

787
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:17,639
many areas in the field of cannabis

788
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:23,069
there whether is the plant cannabinoids

789
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:26,879
on the endogenous cannabinoids well they

790
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:29,880
should be a lot of joint work a lot of

791
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,789
collaboration there is no way we can

792
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,160
understand what's going on by looking

793
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:37,610
just at the chemistry or looking just at

794
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:42,599
the pharmacology were looking just at a

795
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:45,930
physiology it has to be in collaboration

796
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,539
and our group has collaborated with a

797
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:50,639
huge number of the colleagues all over

798
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:55,679
the world I mentioned that in more

799
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:58,859
detail around the end of my lecture now

800
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:02,339
here is what I said that two AG in

801
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:05,099
addition to blocking the brain trauma or

802
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:08,430
at least relieving some of the damage

803
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:12,360
that was caused was found to be

804
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:15,909
decreased in major depression so is it

805
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:20,289
possible that at least in some patients

806
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:23,199
major depression is caused by the fact

807
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:27,940
that the body has levels that are too

808
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:30,339
low the levels of 2 AG now we have seen

809
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,530
something of that sort between Ananda

810
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:36,070
mite and exact and anxiety in this was

811
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:39,490
work that was published by Hill some

812
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:42,580
time ago again here we have an opening

813
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:45,869
that most definitely needs further

814
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:50,170
development and as I said there are two

815
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:51,880
receptors the cb1 receptor causes in

816
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:56,170
addition to many other things the

817
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:59,019
well-known effects of cannabis changes

818
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:02,430
in mood and changes in activity and so

819
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:05,769
on the cb2 doesn't do that CBT is

820
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:09,219
exclusively a neuro protective mechanism

821
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:11,710
at least 90% of its actions protective

822
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:13,989
and one you can see that because we have

823
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:17,139
there are papers showing that CBT

824
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:21,009
receptors work in myocardial infraction

825
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:23,739
in atherosclerosis in stroke in fibrosis

826
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:27,280
in cetera et cetera again there are a

827
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:30,839
few companies working on synthetic cb2

828
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:36,250
agonists and I believe that we shall see

829
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:39,579
synthetic cb2 Agony's has jerks against

830
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:43,030
at least some of these diseases and it

831
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:46,809
is possible to do that because we have

832
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:48,820
and other groups have done the same it

833
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:51,460
is possible to synthesize compound

834
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:53,710
detect only in the cb2 and the

835
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,690
protective mechanism they don't act on

836
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,750
the cb1 so it doesn't matter whether

837
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:01,030
somebody may get very high doses one

838
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:03,429
does not see that their cannabinoid

839
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:07,750
effects won't see only the effect on the

840
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:12,190
cv 2 and it is possible and and abide to

841
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:14,199
AG THC act at both and cb1 and cb2 it's

842
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:17,509
possible again as I said before to

843
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:20,208
synthesize compounds and hereto to

844
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:22,548
examples of compounds that act only in

845
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:25,518
the cb2 and chances are that we shall

846
00:44:22,548 --> 00:44:28,309
see them compounds of this type in the

847
00:44:25,518 --> 00:44:32,558
market now I want to come to the last

848
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:36,200
part of my lecture and it has to do with

849
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:41,528
the activity of Ananda might like

850
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:44,449
compounds as I said and and might is a

851
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:48,768
simple compound relatively simple

852
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:51,498
compound it is formed from a fatty acid

853
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:54,318
which is bound to an amino acid in our

854
00:44:51,498 --> 00:44:57,228
body has about 20 fatty acids therein

855
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,298
has about 20 amino acids and so the body

856
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:02,629
using the already the synthetic

857
00:44:59,298 --> 00:45:04,219
mechanism it knows about is lazy if it

858
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,349
can use something that it knows how to

859
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:09,650
use it will use it as much as possible

860
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:12,079
so in this case the body has to learn

861
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:15,499
how to make an animate and by the same

862
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,329
synthetic mechanism it can make many

863
00:45:15,498 --> 00:45:19,848
other compounds fatty acids and amino

864
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:21,589
acids and it has made about a hundred of

865
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:24,469
them so speak about the three or four

866
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:26,808
that have been investigated now let's

867
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:29,630
start again from brain injury brain

868
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:33,380
injury acts have been told in two

869
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:35,690
directions causing the effects and

870
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,358
compounds of brain present in the body

871
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:42,199
called glutamate cytokines and so on and

872
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:46,489
they can bring to cell death and this is

873
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:48,798
what we see in most cases of brain and

874
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:51,458
true injury but there is also something

875
00:45:48,798 --> 00:45:53,659
else in brain injury one sees

876
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:57,228
vasoconstriction the blood vessels

877
00:45:53,659 --> 00:46:00,708
constrict and it is not healthy and so

878
00:45:57,228 --> 00:46:03,558
the body tries to prevent or to lower

879
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:08,778
who has a constriction so we compared

880
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:12,650
the vasoconstriction that whether the

881
00:46:08,778 --> 00:46:14,630
THC CBD Ananda might lower

882
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:19,639
vasoconstriction and we saw that the

883
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:23,480
brain extract does that better then

884
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:26,538
these compounds so the answer was do we

885
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:30,740
have compounds that the brain makes and

886
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:34,130
that they block or try to block by as a

887
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:36,889
constriction thereby so dilate us so I

888
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:40,068
had a PhD student who worked very out on

889
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:43,420
that and after a few years was able to

890
00:46:40,068 --> 00:46:46,190
identify a compound which is very close

891
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:48,260
chemically to Ananda might you can see

892
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,838
the Ananda button on the top and left

893
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:54,528
hand side and we isolated the compound

894
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:56,989
which is essentially the same but it has

895
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:59,630
another carboxyl group there it is not

896
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:02,239
bind to the receptor but it is a

897
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:05,180
vasodilator a pretty potent vasodilator

898
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:07,899
and this is what our body does when

899
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:11,389
there is a who has a constriction it

900
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:14,539
synthesizes this compound which is

901
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:16,639
closely related to an antibody so we

902
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:20,150
said to ourselves well maybe they are

903
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:22,670
additional and endermite like compounds

904
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:27,710
in the body so this is the third phase

905
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:30,019
the phase which quite a few people in

906
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:32,269
the field work the three phases I have

907
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:35,000
mentioned that the plant chemistry in

908
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:37,368
the plant canopy noise the compounds

909
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,500
that we make and animate into AG and now

910
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:42,528
I'm speaking of Ananda might like

911
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:45,349
compounds and this was the first case

912
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:48,369
when we discovered it roughly don't know

913
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:50,470
in serine has something to do with

914
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:53,509
vasoconstriction

915
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:59,929
we were doing some research in professor

916
00:47:53,509 --> 00:48:02,028
BAPS lab on bone remodeling we had

917
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:04,219
nothing to do at least we thought it has

918
00:48:02,028 --> 00:48:07,309
nothing to do with with bones and we

919
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:10,848
shall see we shall hear quite a bit on

920
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:16,380
that by by a colleague of ours will be

921
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:21,269
talking this afternoon and we found the

922
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:25,829
that the body makes again a compound

923
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:29,368
which is again an endermite like

924
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:33,950
compound there is a fatty acid in this

925
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:37,769
case oleic acid found in olive oil and

926
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:41,338
it is bound to an amino acid called

927
00:48:37,768 --> 00:48:43,018
serine now all this came from a work

928
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:47,420
that was published many years ago

929
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:51,179
showing that osteoporosis is less

930
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:54,559
prevalent in the Middle East or in the

931
00:48:51,179 --> 00:49:01,679
countries around the Mediterranean then

932
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:06,170
in no way and it was that's what they

933
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:10,588
suggested maybe because women in the

934
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:15,809
Mediterranean region have consumed olive

935
00:49:10,588 --> 00:49:18,239
oil and indeed after the age of 55 and

936
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:20,910
so on with all the hormonal changes the

937
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:22,828
body does something which prevents the

938
00:49:20,909 --> 00:49:25,618
osteoporosis which otherwise will be

939
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:30,119
seen in essentially all women at that

940
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:32,519
age and so we tried olive oil and we try

941
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,220
to oleic acid they didn't work but then

942
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:37,739
we tried derivatives of oleic acid and

943
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:40,548
we then looked for these compounds in

944
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:43,469
the body and we found again as I said a

945
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:47,460
fatty acid bound to an amino acid it is

946
00:49:43,469 --> 00:49:52,250
a very potent compound that works

947
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:56,068
against bone destruction there is

948
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:58,318
company to things that it can do

949
00:49:56,068 --> 00:50:01,920
something with it and developing it so

950
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:04,949
here we have a compound which may prove

951
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:09,180
to be of major interest indeed if we

952
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:12,868
take animals and cause osteoporosis and

953
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:15,659
I wouldn't go into the details you can

954
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:19,079
see the red the bone is being destroyed

955
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:22,399
the green is before the destruction of

956
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:26,330
the bone the red is after the bone has

957
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,150
started to be destructed because of

958
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:32,929
the hormonal changes if we give this

959
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:34,760
these animals the compound synthetic in

960
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:37,549
this case of course the compound that

961
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:40,880
our body makes it the bone starts

962
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:42,830
growing up now this may be of importance

963
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,660
because most of the drugs that are

964
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:50,029
available today for that kind of disease

965
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:53,059
stop the destruction but they do not in

966
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:56,780
most cases help with the new formation

967
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:59,659
of bone and here we have compound that

968
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:02,600
may be also in humans they never tested

969
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:06,039
in humans not only stops the disease but

970
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:10,519
also causes the bone to be built again

971
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:15,230
and I want to end with something that we

972
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:16,880
are doing at the moment and it has to do

973
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:20,240
with addiction not gonna be noise

974
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:24,890
addiction but addiction in general our

975
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:26,389
body sees addiction as a disease for

976
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:31,879
many years it was thought that it is

977
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:33,339
something only psychological nothing to

978
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,970
be seen

979
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:39,680
chemically or biochemically or

980
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:40,939
pharmacologically well today this is not

981
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:44,179
accepted anymore

982
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:47,900
it is addiction is considered to be a

983
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:50,379
disease if it is a disease the chance to

984
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:53,539
sound we thought that our body tries to

985
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:56,539
fight against the disease this is what

986
00:51:53,539 --> 00:52:01,239
our body does with most diseases so what

987
00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:04,009
how does our body fight addiction and

988
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:06,319
turned out that we do not know we do not

989
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:09,530
know anything most of the research that

990
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:12,050
has been an addiction addictions is on

991
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:15,260
the addicted people nobody has looked

992
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:18,220
into those that use compound that cause

993
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:21,740
addiction and are not addicted why

994
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:25,519
aren't these people addicted why not

995
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:27,639
addicted well again this was done in

996
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:30,150
collaboration as I said before

997
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:32,699
collaboration is essential

998
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:34,829
to work in the cannabinoids field and in

999
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:39,028
this case were four groups in addition

1000
00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:41,970
to mine a group in Virginia the US a

1001
00:52:39,028 --> 00:52:44,159
group in Canada and a group in Italy and

1002
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:46,318
we meet at meetings we drink a lot of

1003
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:49,949
coffee together we discuss things we

1004
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:53,389
don't throw the compliment the chairs

1005
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:57,449
went to the other but we discuss things

1006
00:52:53,389 --> 00:53:01,828
for many hours and we decided to look

1007
00:52:57,449 --> 00:53:07,528
for compounds that maybe our body

1008
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:09,539
produces and we found a paper that a

1009
00:53:07,528 --> 00:53:12,838
person who was strongly addicted to

1010
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:15,990
nicotine and a certain part of the his

1011
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:20,009
brain had been damaged in a car accident

1012
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:22,379
was not law was not addicted anymore so

1013
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:26,789
we thought maybe this part of the brain

1014
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:29,490
produces a compound that blocks nicotine

1015
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:31,470
addiction well nobody volunteer to give

1016
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:36,528
his brain so he had to do it with mice

1017
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:40,018
again so the part we had mice that were

1018
00:53:36,528 --> 00:53:42,389
addicted we had mice that who had brain

1019
00:53:40,018 --> 00:53:45,179
damage in that particular brain part of

1020
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:48,150
the brain and we looked for the compound

1021
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:53,129
and indeed we found the compound and to

1022
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:56,670
our great surprise maybe we found that

1023
00:53:53,130 --> 00:54:01,108
the compound belongs to the Ananda might

1024
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:04,289
like compounds it is a relatively simple

1025
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:07,920
compound oleic acid bound which is a

1026
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:11,130
fatty acid bound to glycine and this

1027
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,680
particular compound blocks the formation

1028
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:19,019
of nicotine addiction there are quite a

1029
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:22,469
few ways of doing that one can just in a

1030
00:54:19,018 --> 00:54:25,798
few words we can have mice sitting

1031
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:29,429
between food that contains nicotine and

1032
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:31,318
food does not contain nicotine and this

1033
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:33,480
is called conditioned plays preference

1034
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:35,489
then the mice at the beginning go 50

1035
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,108
percent here and 50 percent there but

1036
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:39,838
then they slowly get addicted to the

1037
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:43,730
nicotine and all of them go to the part

1038
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:46,840
of the where the nicotine is so we

1039
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:50,179
look this and a few other models by

1040
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:54,400
administering or real glycine to these

1041
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:54,399
animals then they don't get addicted

1042
00:54:54,429 --> 00:55:00,259
does this compound working at other

1043
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:05,079
addictions to the best of our knowledge

1044
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:10,520
the answer is no we tried to see whether

1045
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:13,809
this compound OG like a lil glycine can

1046
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:19,219
block same thing with opiate it does not

1047
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:22,029
but we found something else we found

1048
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:24,769
that this particular compound set

1049
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:26,119
reasonably high levels can block the

1050
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:28,070
withdrawal symptoms

1051
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:31,760
both of nicotine addiction and

1052
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:34,220
appropriate addiction and our colleagues

1053
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,040
in Canada have now done quite a lot of

1054
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:40,608
work outstanding work I believe showing

1055
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:43,219
that this simple compound can block the

1056
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:51,380
withdrawal symptoms not only of nicotine

1057
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:53,659
but of morphine sometimes very often one

1058
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:56,000
of the treatments of opiate addicted

1059
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:59,000
people that brought to the hospital a

1060
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,269
given compound that will naloxone that

1061
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,079
will cause we draw but it can help the

1062
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:08,690
patient but the withdrawal can be really

1063
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,940
really very bad well we can block the

1064
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:13,460
addiction at least in mice by giving

1065
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:15,789
them the allele lights in now we're

1066
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:18,769
trying to find out whether we have

1067
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:21,559
additional compounds made by the brain

1068
00:56:18,769 --> 00:56:25,099
brain in my strain of rats that work

1069
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:30,259
against the opiate addiction because we

1070
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:33,409
know that not all a users opiate users

1071
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:35,810
get addicted 80 percent 90 percent of

1072
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:38,269
them do what about the others so I

1073
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:41,889
believe that here we have quite an

1074
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,889
opening to some new

1075
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:50,949
well ideas maybe and hopefully these

1076
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:55,389
ideas will bring new drugs against the

1077
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:58,059
various addictions well let me summarize

1078
00:56:55,389 --> 00:57:01,230
what I've been saying over the last

1079
00:56:58,059 --> 00:57:03,389
almost hour the endocannabinoids

1080
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:06,760
involved a large number of physiological

1081
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:09,429
processes and THC mimics their actions

1082
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,740
I'm surprised that the endocannabinoids

1083
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:14,349
indane cannabinoid system were now

1084
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:16,000
discovered when dopamine serotonin were

1085
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:18,880
discovered these are important

1086
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,349
neurotransmitters why I don't know

1087
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,780
because they are not more complicated

1088
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:25,329
than the dopamine the serotonin system

1089
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:28,510
but this is what we have so if the next

1090
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:30,369
decade next few decades we should learn

1091
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:33,150
quite a lot more about the

1092
00:57:30,369 --> 00:57:36,280
endocannabinoid system in this respect

1093
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:39,160
another hand CBD is turned out to be an

1094
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:42,670
extremely interesting compound and again

1095
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:44,949
we should know more about CBD after

1096
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:47,650
clinical trials are done at the moment

1097
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:51,879
we see a lot of noise around CBD but in

1098
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:54,250
most cases we have no clinical trials

1099
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:57,160
and many of the things we hear about CBD

1100
00:57:54,250 --> 00:58:01,269
are just well out of the blue if you

1101
00:57:57,159 --> 00:58:03,219
wish now the third thing that I want to

1102
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:05,320
mention that the endocannabinoid like

1103
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:08,589
compounds and this was the third part of

1104
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:13,330
my lecture may certainly bring new drugs

1105
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:14,980
to a wide variety of diseases and I hope

1106
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:17,799
that this will happen and the same is

1107
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:22,139
true for the CB to specific compounds

1108
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:25,450
compounds that act and the CBT cb2

1109
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:27,909
receptors alone because we see no side

1110
00:58:25,449 --> 00:58:31,299
effects except in very very unusual

1111
00:58:27,909 --> 00:58:33,899
cases we see no side effects from drugs

1112
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:37,810
attacked and cb2 alone and I want to

1113
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:40,090
thanks my collaborator in Israel many of

1114
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:44,049
them in my lab some of them have

1115
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:46,809
professor in different departments they

1116
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:50,500
may be in the School of Pharmacy some of

1117
00:58:46,809 --> 00:58:52,840
them are in the School of Medicine and I

1118
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,210
to thank in particular my collaborators

1119
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:58,210
abroad I said it is impossible to do

1120
00:58:55,210 --> 00:59:05,260
work in this field and actually in many

1121
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:08,380
many other fields by just working in one

1122
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:10,270
part of the area only in chemistry only

1123
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:14,910
in pharmacology or something of that

1124
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:17,559
sort it has to be done in collaboration

1125
00:59:14,909 --> 00:59:19,690
because I see no difference as a matter

1126
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:22,170
of fact there's no scientific difference

1127
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:24,820
between chemistry and pharmacology we

1128
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:27,849
separate them because we are possibly

1129
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:29,530
unable to know everything about two

1130
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:31,869
fields we barely know a little bit about

1131
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:35,109
one of the fields and I want to thank

1132
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:37,740
them and I want to thank you for being

1133
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:37,739
at my lecture
