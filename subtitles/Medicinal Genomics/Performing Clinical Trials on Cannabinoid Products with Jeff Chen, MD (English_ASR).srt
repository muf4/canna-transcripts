very important ways

this episode i spoke with dr jeff chen

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
about conducting clinical trials on

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,000
cannabinoid products

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,560
dr chen is the co-founder and ceo of

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,959
radical science a health tech company

67
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,239
generating history's first data set and

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,400
ai to prove and predict the effects of

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,158
health and wellness products

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,120
previously he was the founder and

71
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,878
executive director at the ucla cannabis

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,640
research initiative

73
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:15,518
at cammed 2022 dr chen presented results

74
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,759
from radical sciences aces study which

75
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,439
was a randomized clinical trial

76
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:23,359
involving 13 cbd products and 3 000

77
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,359
participants

78
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
the project was possible thanks to

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,239
radical sciences unique virtual approach

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,799
to clinical trials which removes many of

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,519
the challenges that make them expensive

82
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,439
and difficult to conduct

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,000
topics covered during the conversation

84
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,759
include the many challenges associated

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
with performing clinical trials on

86
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,158
cannabinoids how a virtual

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
direct-to-consumer approach overcomes

88
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,479
many of these challenges

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,479
the value brands manufacturers and

90
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,598
distributors get from clinical trial

91
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,000
data

92
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:59,119
results from the aces study the largest

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,519
randomized cbd clinical trial in history

94
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,920
how radical applied lessons from the

95
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,519
aces study to design the radical

96
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,679
spectrum study

97
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,759
and other minor cannabinoids that

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,360
radical science is investigating in

99
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,639
which have the most therapeutic

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
potential

101
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,639

102
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,879

good afternoon dr jeff how are you doing

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,880
today

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
i'm doing great thanks for having me ben

125
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,038
excited for this yeah i'm excited too

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,720
because we're talking today about a very

127
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,599
important topic and that's clinical

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,919
trials um i had professor matrulam on

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
the podcast a little while back and he

130
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,680
was very passionate about the need for

131
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,918
more clinical trials

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,079
and you know anecdotal evidence is great

133
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,560
individual case studies are useful but

134
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,478
clinical trials are the best we need

135
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,399
good data to silence those who are

136
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,159
opposing cannabinoid medicine and claim

137
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,719
that there isn't enough data to show

138
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,479
efficacy so i know that your group at

139
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,240
radical science is approaching clinical

140
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,079
trials in a new way

141
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,519
and i encourage people to check out your

142
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:59,038
kanmed 2022 presentation in our archive

143
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,318
on kim at events.com to learn more um

144
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,399
so to start

145
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,240
i'm hoping you can explain why is it so

146
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,038
difficult to perform good clinical

147
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,759
trials on cannabinoid medicines

148
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,519
sure

149
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,759
well the the first thing to realize is

150
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,318
clinical trials in general regardless of

151
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,479
what you're studying are already

152
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,919
gargantuan undertakings and you're

153
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,519
talking about

154
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,000
high cost

155
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,719
extreme complexity and also a very slow

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,279
speed to completion

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,400
a clinical trial can easily run millions

158
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,119
of dollars

159
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,839
requires a team of very talented

160
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,478
scientists and

161
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,318
physicians and can easily take years

162
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,399
so as soon as you

163
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,240
understand that about clinical trials

164
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,839
then instantly you already see why it's

165
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,680
a barrier to any sort of

166
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,239
compound or product

167
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,199
that say isn't backed by a large pharma

168
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,519
company

169
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,680
that has the resources wherewithal and

170
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,758
more importantly the experience to

171
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,038
navigate a clinical trial so that's the

172
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,560
first thing to understand now

173
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,918
there's this might be a conversation for

174
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,478
a separate time as to why they're so

175
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,639
expensive and slow but a lot of it's

176
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,000
they're they're they're bureaucratic

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,000
there's a lot of regulations around the

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,279
clinical trials expensive personnel are

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,199
involved again

180
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,038
high-level scientists phds doctors they

181
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
often involve clinical trial sites so

182
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,719
now you have expensive medical

183
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,960
facilities the experience for people in

184
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
the clinical trial is sub-optimal to say

185
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,120
the least so now you have to

186
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,000
pay them incentives to put up with all

187
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,038
the inconvenience and take potentially

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,800
scary

189
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,439
you know experimental drugs all these

190
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,840
things all right now let's zooming in on

191
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,680
cannabinoids specifically what makes

192
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,478
clinical trials difficult on

193
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,360
cannabinoids i'll focus on the us but a

194
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,560
lot of these also parallel other places

195
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,919
around the world the first thing is the

196
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,959
regulatory

197
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:54,240
classification of cannabinoids when it

198
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,399
comes to thc it's a controlled substance

199
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,478
and so if a researcher wants to research

200
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,758
thc they need to go get special dea

201
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,918
licenses

202
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,439
and if you're even after obtaining those

203
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,598
dea licenses they can only purchase

204
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,598
those controlled cannabinoids from other

205
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,038
people who have a dea license to

206
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,079
manufacture those controlled

207
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,878
cannabinoids when it comes to cannabis

208
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,000
thc containing cannabis

209
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
for

210
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,240
last 50 years there was only one entity

211
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,918
that had that dea license it was the

212
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,120
university of mississippi

213
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,279
in the last

214
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,360
you know six to 12 months a handful of

215
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,799
other entities have been granted those

216
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,919
licenses

217
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,519
um

218
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,879
but so that's that's the difficulty as a

219
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,120
researcher i got to go through all these

220
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,639
extra hoops to get that license once i

221
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,799
have the license from the dea i'm very

222
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,360
limited into who i can buy those

223
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,039
controlled substance cannabinoids from i

224
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,480
have to store them a certain way i have

225
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,079
to install security systems even though

226
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
there might be a cannabis dispensary

227
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
across the street where anyone over

228
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,320
you know the age of 21 can walk in and

229
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,120
buy stuff i still have to treat this

230
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
uh

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
like how the federal government defines

232
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
it

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
when it comes to other cannabinoids

234
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,839
things like cbd research is different

235
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,879
difficult for a different reason

236
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,560
so when it comes to cbd the fda is

237
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,720
saying okay

238
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,359
cbd while it might not be a controlled

239
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,120
substance anymore after the 2018 farm

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,519
bill

241
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,679
we now consider it a drug

242
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,600
like a pharmaceutical drug that's

243
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,559
because epidiolex

244
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,360
is a basically cbd isolate it's fda

245
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,679
approved so cbd isn't a drug

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,000
if you want to research cbd you need to

247
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,599
go through an investigational new drug

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,480
process

249
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,720
and

250
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,759
that process is both onerous for the

251
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
researcher

252
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,399
and onerous for the company supplying

253
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,479
the product to go into the study

254
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,958
if it was classified as just a dietary

255
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,959
supplement study it's so much easier for

256
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,479
the producer of the product to get the

257
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,479
product

258
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,399
up to spec for the study and it's so

259
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,920
much less cumbersome for the researcher

260
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,159
but as soon as the

261
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,439
product has to undergo the research as

262
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,120
an investigational new drug it makes it

263
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
very difficult if not nearly impossible

264
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
for a vast majority of in this case cbd

265
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,200
providers to have their product

266
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,959
classified and be registered with the

267
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,800
fda as a

268
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,359
acceptable investigational new drug and

269
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,120
in places a much more cumbersome process

270
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,879
on the researcher you do see this in

271
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,000
other countries as well there's a reason

272
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,919
that canada

273
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,480
legalized cannabis and cannabinoids

274
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,679
medically 10 years ago how many rigorous

275
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
clinical trials have you seen come out

276
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,479
of canada on any cannabinoids it's

277
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,680
because they still need special licenses

278
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,519
from the government to research

279
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,958
cannabinoids and then the cannabinoids

280
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,919
they can research have to then go

281
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,078
through this

282
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,240
you know more stricter process than say

283
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,078
a herbal study or dietary supplement

284
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,680
study

285
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,759
so it seems like a weird kind of

286
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,919
catch-22 or chicken in the egg i don't

287
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,799
know which metaphor fits here but

288
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,399
um

289
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,399
you know the government is saying that

290
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,559
you know we need more data before we can

291
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,720
you know make this a non-controlled

292
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,119
substance or you know open it up for

293
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,480
more research or you know legalize it

294
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,919
medically but

295
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,560
they're also making it difficult to do

296
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,799
any of this research in order to make to

297
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,799
to classify it that way

298
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,519
that that's exactly it and there have

299
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:17,199
been attempts to

300
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,360
change laws to make the process easier

301
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,480
i haven't seen too much traction on that

302
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,320
end i know there have been bills

303
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,360
presented in front of congress to try

304
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,040
and change

305
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,720
elements of this

306
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,639
but even if you can solve the

307
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
unique restrictions and difficulties

308
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,039
that cannabinoids face until you

309
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,559
fundamentally solve the complexities and

310
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,240
the high cost and the slow speed of

311
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,119
trials you're still not going to get the

312
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,440
data you need on any sort of

313
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
acceptable time scale and on any sort of

314
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,480
acceptable

315
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,240
rigor and volume of data to allow

316
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
people to make enough decisions

317
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,278
appropriate decisions on cannabinoids

318
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,719
there's

319
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,480
tens of millions of americans using

320
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,160
cannabinoids every day

321
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,440
and

322
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,879
with the current pace of research

323
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,600
studies we might not have data for a

324
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,159
decade or more to appropriately inform

325
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,920
who should use what type and what

326
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:11,199
dosage for what use case who should

327
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,039
avoid what type at what dosage

328
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,600
if they have other existing

329
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,519
issues for example

330
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,639
right so we need a new approach and

331
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
that's what you guys are doing at

332
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,839
radical science so explain how how you

333
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,439
guys are approaching clinical

334
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,040
trials so radical science were

335
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,959
reimagining clinical trials from the

336
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,919
ground up the first area that we wanted

337
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,679
to

338
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,958
start was to ensure that we're not

339
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,479
trapped by many of the same

340
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,399
federal funding restrictions that

341
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,800
universities are trapped by

342
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,278
and so this is why

343
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,679
universities even state public

344
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,240
universities in states where cannabis is

345
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,559
legal they still can only follow federal

346
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,320
rules study federally regulated

347
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,919
cannabinoids in a federally compliant

348
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
fashion that's because they take federal

349
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,879
funding almost all universities take

350
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,320
federal funding

351
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,240
so

352
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,320
instantly you're eliminating the option

353
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,839
for them to study things that again tens

354
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,920
of millions of americans are using every

355
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,079
day so we avoid federal funding we don't

356
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,078
take federal grains and because of that

357
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,000
we have a lot more flexibility in

358
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,239
studying things like cbd for example

359
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,320
without an investigational new drug

360
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,440
process or studying other cannabinoids

361
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,399
from hemp for example

362
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,320
also

363
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,759
we wanted to address the cost the high

364
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,079
cost and the slow speed of clinical

365
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,360
trials and to do that we adopted a

366
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,599
virtual direct to consumer trial process

367
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
so with the virtualization of it we can

368
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,560
eliminate

369
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,440
all that expensive infrastructure

370
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,359
the hospitals the clinics the fancy

371
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
buildings that many universities like to

372
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,039
spend money on

373
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,278
we go completely virtual

374
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,039
and then when we go direct to consumer

375
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,078
the data capture

376
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,559
is directly from consumers i don't have

377
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:57,278
a nurse or a doctor or a research staff

378
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,278
having to interview every single

379
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,198
person in the study hand them a paper

380
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,399
survey collect their responses then

381
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,838
upload that paper survey into a computer

382
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,440
for example i'm collecting data from

383
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,040
them directly so i've removed the

384
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,959
intermediaries

385
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,679
and expensive intermediaries expensive

386
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,198
personnel that were driving up the cost

387
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,958
also streamlining a lot of the

388
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,719
operational aspects of clinical trial

389
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,799
automating them with technology it's

390
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,519
another key innovation that we've done

391
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,120
as well at radical science

392
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,879
in addition we're vertically integrated

393
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,560
we don't hire some other firm to do our

394
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,240
recruitment we don't hire some other

395
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,439
firm to do our analysis and report

396
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,039
generation

397
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,199
we do everything in-house from the

398
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,399
design of the studies to the powering of

399
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:40,319
the studies to the technology stack that

400
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,919
uh collects data and manages and

401
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,120
oversees the studies to the analysis the

402
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,799
reporting everything we do end to end

403
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
and that's how we can also drive

404
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,639
additional

405
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,560
cost and speed improvements to our

406
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,879
clients and one other key innovation of

407
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,559
radical science is that we're running

408
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,320
template studies

409
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,159
and so we like to say that we've done

410
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
for clinical trials what ford motors did

411
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,360
for automobiles

412
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,440
so a hundred years ago before ford came

413
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
along you could get a car

414
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,040
it was just

415
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,518
made to order customized and hand built

416
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,879
by a team of guys for a year or two and

417
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,159
it was only available to the 0.01

418
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,679
and then ford came along and said you

419
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,399
know what screw that i'm going to build

420
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,479
the model t it's a template car it's

421
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,679
going to have four doors four wheels

422
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,440
this type of engine if you don't like

423
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,638
that you can go order

424
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,480
your hand-built car but for the 99 of

425
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,480
people that this is good enough

426
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,639
and this is appropriate great so we've

427
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,399
done that for clinical trials and so we

428
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,240
don't do custom studies you want a

429
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,559
custom study to come to us we say sorry

430
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,399
you can go find one of a thousand

431
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,239
universities and cross do that custom

432
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,679
study for you but if you want a template

433
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
study that's ten times cheaper and

434
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,479
faster and you're interested in one of

435
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,600
the template studies we offer pain

436
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,639
uh anxiety mood sleep energy cognition

437
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
fatigue

438
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,639
great let's talk we can turn this around

439
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,800
in a way that's never been done before

440
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,240
and drive and help you drive the r d

441
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,679
that you need help you substantiate the

442
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,120
claims that you need to your

443
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,638
stakeholders

444
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,799
wow that's interesting and i love that

445
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,879
analogy so so what do these templates

446
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,479
look like and how would they differ from

447
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,000
you know a clinical trial that's done in

448
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,120
a university um i mean obviously not not

449
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,440
including the things you talked about

450
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,320
with it being virtual and all that but

451
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,440
just the the study itself so that's the

452
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,519
thing these studies are actually

453
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,160
designed in collaboration with

454
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,000
university researchers and professors

455
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,679
they consult with us in an individual

456
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,799
capacity because oftentimes they're

457
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,838
frustrated

458
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,000
with the fact that it's basically

459
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,759
impossible to do these same studies at

460
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,159
the universities and what these

461
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,240
professors love to do at any one in

462
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,319
academia they love to think they love to

463
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,879
be creative they love to analyze data

464
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,879
what they don't love to do is

465
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,958
redundant bureaucratic operations and

466
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,720
paperwork which is now driving you know

467
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,559
that's that's kind of like the hallmark

468
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,360
of these clinical trials now in these

469
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:01,278
university environments right and so

470
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,079
fundamentally the design the rationale

471
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:03,759
the

472
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,359
controls we put in place to eliminate

473
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,959
bias they are no different than gold

474
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,399
standard clinical trials run at

475
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,400
universities so you know in radical

476
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,600
science we're running blinded randomized

477
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,319
placebo-controlled trials at large scale

478
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,879
using validated outcome measures

479
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:22,399
uh and analyzing them using kind of gold

480
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,319
standard approaches to biostatistics

481
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,640
so from that standpoint the studies are

482
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,918
the same caliber it's just we've been

483
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,720
able to

484
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,679
do them in a process

485
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,360
direct to

486
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,759
virtual automated streamlined to lower

487
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,439
the cost and improve the speed

488
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,599
and then with this template approach we

489
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,279
furthermore save time when you call

490
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,759
radical science i don't need to spend

491
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,399
six months thinking of a study designing

492
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,640
it

493
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,240
powering it building in our tech stack

494
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,960
and then going out to run it and being

495
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,798
like whoops i didn't foresee xyz issue

496
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,558
it's delayed now or the date is not as

497
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,160
great as it could be i've already run

498
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,480
this study

499
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,080
27 times you're the 28th time i'm

500
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
running it sign the contract it's ready

501
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,240
to go there's no anticipated delays

502
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,440
there's no unexpected mistakes that are

503
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,798
going to come about

504
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,880
it's a it's a factory line so when you

505
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,038
buy toyota camry it's going to work a

506
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,280
lot better than when you buy some dudes

507
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,480
can build hot rod in his garage and he's

508
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,119
driving it for the first time to your

509
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,640
house to deliver it to you yeah no and i

510
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,079
would imagine having that template

511
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,880
approach too and make it easier to

512
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,599
compare one study to another

513
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,640
in the long run that's theoretically

514
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,480
possible

515
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,480
although that's not that's not really an

516
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,160
intended goal i guess that's that's

517
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,000
theoretically possible

518
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,600
in the long run but also keep in mind

519
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,119
with with our

520
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,959
studies

521
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,959
the data is all confidential to the

522
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,279
brand so the goal here is not to show

523
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,960
one company is or is not better with

524
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,759
their approval

525
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,160
then yes the template nature does allow

526
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,160
you to look between studies somewhat and

527
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,720
the asus study for example was one where

528
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,400
all the brands specifically opted in to

529
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,038
this aggregate kind of comparison across

530
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,880
all of their uh products but otherwise

531
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,640
the stuff the data

532
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,160
both the identity of the brands we work

533
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,160
with and their specific study data it's

534
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,600
all confidential to them we only talk

535
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,600
about it if they give us permission

536
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,079
interesting yeah and so

537
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,000
i guess that's a good question too so

538
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,839
the answer is probably obvious but what

539
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,160
is the benefit of having this clinical

540
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,839
dr trial data for the brands themselves

541
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,600
what can they do with that or what does

542
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,759
that enable them to do that they

543
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,918
wouldn't be able to do otherwise

544
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,160
yeah i would say there's many different

545
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,440
reasons that brands have come to us

546
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,679
and sometimes it's not just the brand

547
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,160
sometimes it's the ingredient suppliers

548
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,559
that have come to us to do studies

549
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,400
hoping that they can prove

550
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,160
uh that their ingredients

551
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,640
actually work and therefore it's not a

552
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,558
commodity they can sell more of it sell

553
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,320
it at a premium price

554
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,480
compared to other people that don't have

555
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,639
that data or for some of these minor

556
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,480
cannabinoids generate the first ever

557
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
data of human effectiveness and

558
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,000
basically create the market in demand

559
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,919
for that cannabis now the ingredient

560
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,558
supplier or that distributor or the

561
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,240
manufacturer of that product can benefit

562
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,720
but there's also the end stream

563
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
downstream brands who also

564
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,400
engage us too and again the the range of

565
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,240
options are it's everything from

566
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
substantiating claims that's a major one

567
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,480
you know this this ingredient or this

568
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,960
branded product is clinically shown

569
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,480
clinically proven validated demonstrated

570
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,480
to improve xyz to do xyz so you can't

571
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,038
make disease claims

572
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,038
so you're not you're not curing insomnia

573
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,798
you are improving sleep quality and

574
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,720
that's where you don't invoke

575
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,400
the fda's position that this is a drug

576
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,480
making a disease claim

577
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
so claim substantiation is a major one r

578
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,720
d is another major one too so we've run

579
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,798
studies that are as large as several

580
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
thousand people where the company is

581
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,519
comparing up to for instance eight

582
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
different formulations head to head

583
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,960
wanting to understand which one would be

584
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,279
best to take to market

585
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,038
so you're talking about an r d process

586
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,558
that for and this is not cannabinoid

587
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,960
specific any sort of consumer health

588
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,798
product their r d is often like let's

589
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,558
come up theoretically with the product

590
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,119
we give it to a few dozen friends and

591
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,639
family get some anecdotal feedback

592
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,839
feedback looks good my aunt says it

593
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,200
looks good great now let's go make a

594
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,879
multi-million dollar business launch

595
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,400
decision on this

596
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,080
even though there's a very fair chance

597
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,880
it could be placebo

598
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,119
so r d is a big piece of this as well

599
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,240
and then other areas i think brands also

600
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,558
realize that having this data is

601
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,400
valuable for them to go raise money

602
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,678
from skeptical investors who see them at

603
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,679
like every other company out there

604
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,200
hawking a supplement or hacking some

605
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,880
consumer health product

606
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,080
dramatically raises their valuation

607
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,600
dramatically

608
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,359
gets trust from investors and in a

609
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,158
similar vein people who are trying to

610
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,479
get

611
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,600
distribution of retail you know you're

612
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,319
one of

613
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,759
1400 ashwagandha brands that i've talked

614
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,000
to in the last 30 days what makes you

615
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,119
different oh well we have clinical trial

616
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,960
data so you can know that you're

617
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,879
exposing your customers to a product

618
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,798
that's real and by the way our product

619
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,320
can make claims it'll fly off your shelf

620
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,679
so those conversations become

621
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,200
possibilities as well with the right

622
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,038
data

623
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,120
excellent and now in order to make those

624
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,558
claims is that that data need to be

625
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,038
public somewhere do they have to publish

626
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,879
it um either on their website or in a

627
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,038
journal or something like that

628
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,600
correct so to make structure function

629
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,400
claims you do have to publish the data

630
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,079
the

631
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
but publishing is a very broad sense it

632
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,960
just needs to be accessible by the

633
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,399
public so it could be a white paper that

634
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,079
sits on your website

635
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
um it could be all the way to peer

636
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,240
review publication as well so some

637
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,519
brands after the studies ready they're

638
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,759
happy just to release it as a white

639
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,359
paper on their website other ones want a

640
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,038
peer-reviewed publication for an extra

641
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,719
layer of credibility so we will we have

642
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:37,839
services where we'll help them and

643
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,360
submit those

644
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,439
papers as well

645
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,678
excellent yeah and you mentioned the

646
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,798
aces study um so i was hoping you could

647
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,720
talk a little bit more about that

648
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,960
because that was a pretty important

649
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,440
study a pretty large study

650
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
yeah so the aces study was the first

651
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,600
study that we attempted as a company and

652
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,080
we launched it about a year ago

653
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,279
at the time our company was pretty small

654
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,599
and pretty young

655
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,720
but it's it's uh i think it's pretty

656
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,038
impressive

657
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
and speaks on on my team that we decided

658
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,798
hey you know we're a company that's six

659
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,159
month old let's just do the largest cbd

660
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,000
clinical trial ever done in history and

661
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,120
let's get it done in six months so

662
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,720
that's the like

663
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,599
goal we set for ourselves and we pulled

664
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,720
it off

665
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:22,558
so we had 14 brands join us in the asus

666
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,960
study it involved nearly 3 000 americans

667
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,639
and this was a

668
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,640
this was a study that was specifically

669
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:34,320
intended to collect real world data

670
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,720
on the usage and outcomes that cbd

671
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,720
products might be providing to the tens

672
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,519
of millions of americans using it

673
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,600
and in order to maintain the real world

674
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,599
lens of the study we decided to make it

675
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,079
an open label study

676
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:50,959
what open label means that people got

677
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,720
the product in a form that was not

678
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
blinded they knew what they were taking

679
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,798
and in this case we wanted the companies

680
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,759
to submit products in their natural form

681
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,759
that was already being sold on a shelf

682
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,759
and again to mimic the experience of

683
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,400
someone going on amazon or walk into a

684
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,960
store

685
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,559
buying a cbd product they know it's cbd

686
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,200
it comes in something that's nice and

687
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,240
labeled right they know the company

688
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,480
behind it

689
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,839
so all these things were meant to mimic

690
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,558
the real world

691
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,959
outcomes and therefore for us to be best

692
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,399
able to approximate those outcomes

693
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,278
so we ran the study we ran it for a

694
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,360
month we got nearly 3 000 americans

695
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,240
and the americans were assigned to one

696
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,079
of

697
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,519
the cbd products

698
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,839
and which they got in the mail or they

699
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,679
were assigned to be in a control arm

700
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,918
where they did not receive any cbd

701
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,000
product but we continue to track their

702
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,520
pain their anxiety their sleep their

703
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,359
well-being and their quality of life

704
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,480
just to understand how it might change

705
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,199
over time

706
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,880
that control allows us to control for

707
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
the natural

708
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,000
progression of these conditions i'm

709
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,480
anxious today

710
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,759
and without any intervention what

711
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,278
happens to my anxiety four weeks from

712
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,879
now maybe gets worse maybe gets better

713
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,720
maybe it stays the same it also allowed

714
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
us to control from macro

715
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,079
environment

716
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,678
instances so for instance if i was

717
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,918
living in ukraine

718
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,600
four months ago and you see my anxiety

719
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,520
spike

720
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,199
if i have a weightless control group i

721
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,440
can be like oh it's probably because you

722
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,440
know the russians invaded anxiety spiked

723
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
across the board i can now control and

724
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,880
factor that in when i look at these

725
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,480
people on the cbd and i go now why is

726
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,400
there anxiety getting worse that's weird

727
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,079
oh that's right a war broke out because

728
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,278
i can look at the control group

729
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,720
so it was important for us to have that

730
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,400
control group

731
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,519
and what we found

732
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,120
uh

733
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,879
was and and we wanted products that have

734
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,038
a variety of different form factors we

735
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,480
had soft gels and gummies and tinctures

736
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,879
and sprays and

737
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,558
dissolving tablets and we had different

738
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,240
spectrums we had isolate full and broad

739
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,558
spectrum and we had different dosages

740
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,480
too again just to get a huge

741
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,519
representation of all the products out

742
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,679
there

743
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,759
and when we analyzed the data we found a

744
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,960
lot of things so

745
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,400
we found

746
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,519
that

747
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,880
there were

748
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,599
significant improvements across the

749
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,919
board for anxiety sleep and pain

750
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:09,599
anxiety had the largest improvements

751
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,559
followed by sleep and followed by pain

752
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,558
and

753
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,038
we also found that the

754
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:17,678
largest improvements tended to happen

755
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,759
within the first half the first week or

756
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,519
two of using the product

757
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,879
and then by weeks three and four there

758
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,639
were still improvements happening but

759
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,278
they were at a much

760
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,799
more reduced pace so think of it as like

761
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,440
if this is their

762
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,798
uh if this is showing the

763
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,400
improvement

764
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:35,759
in their

765
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,600
uh

766
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,759
well-being for example you see in the

767
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,599
first week or two and then you still see

768
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,879
it kind of increase

769
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,599
i guess i realize i was just gesturing

770
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,360
by hands as the podcast so so you see a

771
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,599
sharper increase

772
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,759
in the first week or two and then a more

773
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,079
still increasing but more gradually

774
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,440
sloped off increase in the latter half

775
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,359
of the week

776
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,919
we did some other interesting things we

777
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,158
looked at males and females and we found

778
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,799
that they were that didn't impact

779
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,799
the experience of the outcomes

780
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,879
we also looked at whether people were

781
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,879
naive moderate or experienced cbd users

782
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,200
and we did not find that that predicted

783
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,120
a difference in their health outcomes

784
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,400
from taking cbd and we also looked at

785
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,398
age groups and we also found that that

786
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,159
wasn't a predictor of effect so to recap

787
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,119
it seems that gender

788
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,679
or moreover sex assigned at birth

789
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,479
age group and experience with cbd

790
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,919
weren't

791
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,200
predictive of whether someone was going

792
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,640
to have a good or

793
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,759
bad result or improvement

794
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,600
we also analyzed the data set

795
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,119
by

796
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,240
spectrum

797
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,119
and by dose of cbd

798
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,960
and

799
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,639
what we found was that for spectrum we

800
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,640
did not find

801
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,038
a

802
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,520
significant difference by spectrum and

803
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,200
again i'll caveat that in a second

804
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,918
and when it came to

805
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,840
cbd dose we did not find a predictable

806
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,919
relationship that

807
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,319
a certain amount of cbd was necessarily

808
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,440
better than another amount

809
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,720
and

810
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,558
if you look at

811
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,759
and that's not to say that spectrum

812
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,359
doesn't matter

813
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,720
and that all cbd doses are the same

814
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,879
more likely what's happened is that

815
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,720
there was so much diversity in the

816
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,159
products

817
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,759
that

818
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,679
the products differed in multiple

819
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,240
characteristics right

820
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,798
and it was really hard for us to control

821
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,000
for just spectrum or just we tried our

822
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,639
best

823
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,798
um but i believe there still needs to be

824
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,799
many studies to dig into this notion of

825
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,398
what's the proper spectrum what's the

826
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:43,839
proper dosage that's actually why we

827
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,000
decided to launch these subsequent

828
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:46,798
studies on cbd

829
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,558
that

830
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,639
to fill in these missing gaps in the

831
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,038
knowledge so again to recap this is a

832
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,159
pretty monumental study largest cbd

833
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,720
trial in history we had a control arm

834
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,399
we enrolled nearly 3 000 people we found

835
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,480
that things like gender and age and

836
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,798
experience with cbd weren't predictive

837
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,240
for health outcomes we found that across

838
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,398
the board there were significant

839
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,839
improvements and anxiety sleep in pain

840
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,918
with anxiety experiencing the most

841
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,918
improvements followed by sleep followed

842
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,320
by pain and we also found that side

843
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,399
effects were rare and very mild about 10

844
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,158
percent of people in the study reported

845
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,599
any sort of side effect and they were

846
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,760
all generally mild side effects

847
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,439
great now

848
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,359
in those results was there anything that

849
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,759
stood out to you or that was surprising

850
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,398
or that you didn't expect

851
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,599
you know going into the study

852
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,519
we

853
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,759
i had expected

854
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,879
things like

855
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:45,200
experience with cbd to impact

856
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,919
outcome

857
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,360
and i also had potentially expected sex

858
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,520
assigned at birth

859
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,558
to also impact outcome because we've

860
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,918
seen from pre-clinical studies that sex

861
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,240
of mice male female mice have

862
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,919
differential experiences to cannabinoids

863
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,038
and actually gender differences or sex

864
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,038
differences

865
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,679
are becoming more more apparent across

866
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,440
all sorts of health outcome measures so

867
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,519
i was a little surprised

868
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,440
to see that but again this is an area

869
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,319
where we probably need many many more

870
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,640
studies in this realm to really confirm

871
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,678
what what we're seeing here and i i

872
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,919
forget

873
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,880
who this quote is attributed to but any

874
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,240
good study warrants many many more

875
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,760
follow-up studies so this is just the

876
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,839
first of of blip on the radar to to give

877
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,119
society a starting point with which they

878
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,480
can layer on additional studies on cbd

879
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,918
well yeah and that's a great segue

880
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,558
because you ha are currently doing a

881
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,240
follow-up study uh radical spectrum and

882
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,119
i imagine that you're applying some of

883
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,960
the lessons learned from aces now

884
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:51,678
correct so

885
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,798
radical spectrum you know in aces we we

886
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,038
had some preliminary findings on dose

887
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,000
and spectrum but again we knew that

888
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:59,919
because

889
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,200
these products differed not just in one

890
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,278
characteristic some of these products

891
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,679
differed in form factor

892
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:10,720
and dose and spectrum right um so spec

893
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,679
radical spectrum is a study

894
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,159
where

895
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,440
every company has to submit a minimum of

896
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,840
three things to us they're going to

897
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,360
submit a

898
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:21,439
placebo they're going to submit a cbd

899
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,079
isolate and they're going to submit a

900
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,320
broad or full spectrum product

901
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:29,278
all of these three submissions have to

902
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,398
look identical aka same bottle same form

903
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,798
factor

904
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:36,239
and so the only thing that's differing

905
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:38,398
is the contents

906
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,839
and then the isolate and the broad full

907
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,479
spectrum have to be the same

908
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,720
concentration of cbd so the only thing

909
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,960
differing between them is the other

910
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,360
stuff the other cannabinoids the

911
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,319
terpenoids and so this is a three-armed

912
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,959
study

913
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,480
with which at the end of the study

914
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,759
the brand can have several things

915
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,759
sitting in their data set that could be

916
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,599
useful they can first off they can have

917
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,038
proved that their product works better

918
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,678
than placebo

919
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:07,919
for a variety of health outcome measures

920
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:09,759
quality of life pain sleep anxiety mood

921
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,600
they could also potentially have proved

922
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,240
that their product works better than

923
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,000
isolate

924
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,759
if you look at the reason why the fda

925
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,759
says all these cbd supplements are

926
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:24,960
illegal is because

927
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:26,798
they resemble cbd isolate gw's epidiolex

928
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,278
but this data

929
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,759
might

930
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,759
be some of the first data ever

931
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,599
to show that these supplements do not

932
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,000
perform the same

933
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,839
as a cbd isolate and therefore you might

934
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,640
not be able to lump them

935
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:45,038
with something like a epidiolex from gw

936
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,360
pharmaceuticals and maybe perhaps they

937
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:50,798
aren't subject to

938
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,479
a drug preclusion principle from the fda

939
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,000
so you know the study is nice for the

940
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,278
brands and that

941
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,798
it allows them multiple things again it

942
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,679
allows them to prove their product works

943
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,119
better than placebo which for 99 of cbd

944
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,159
brands they don't have that those data

945
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,918
sets

946
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,480
they can also prove that the product

947
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,360
potentially works better than isolate

948
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,038
um at the same time the the study allows

949
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,798
them to do a dose titration so they can

950
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,278
explore multiple doses

951
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,359
of their product and simultaneously get

952
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,240
multiple shots on goal for quality of

953
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,079
life pain sleep anxiety and mood so

954
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,558
we're really excited about it for now

955
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,960
it's the last cbd study that we're going

956
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,158
to run

957
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,278
we're still going to run studies on

958
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,559
other hemp derived cannabinoids cbc cbg

959
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:37,759
cbn thcv et cetera but the fda is making

960
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,678
it very difficult to even research cbd

961
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,158
so after radical spectrum runs we're

962
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,080
going to table our cbd studies we'll

963
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,480
still be taking studies on other minor

964
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:49,918
cannabinoids because the fda has not

965
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,000
said those are drugs for example okay

966
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,799
and furthermore we're going to we

967
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,240
already have opened up our studies to

968
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,000
non-cannabinoid supplements so we're

969
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,880
running studies on functional mushrooms

970
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,038
and herbs and probiotics and the tropics

971
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,799
and a bunch of other things leveraging

972
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,480
our kind of

973
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,800
newly developed disruptive

974
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,838
trials platform

975
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,440
interesting yeah so first question

976
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:14,719
i take it based on the way you were

977
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,720
talking that the brands that are

978
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,199
involved in the spectrum study they're

979
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:23,358
all broad spectrum or full spectrum

980
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:25,199
brands correct yeah okay and then

981
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,918
secondly so

982
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,918
is cbd it's it's difficult to study

983
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,838
because of that drug designation that

984
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,838
you talked about earlier with epidiolex

985
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:36,960
that's exactly it yeah so

986
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,480
the the fda has

987
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,000
like starting many years ago the fda

988
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,918
first started saying hey you can't sell

989
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,239
cbd as a supplement

990
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,679
it's a drug you gotta

991
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,559
get it approved as a drug before you can

992
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,599
sell it and now we are

993
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:55,519
um increasingly

994
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,359
seeing that even the research of cbd

995
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,280
is going to require an investigational

996
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,759
new drug

997
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,480
uh process which universities have been

998
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,240
beholden to for quite some time we've

999
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,760
been able to do it thus far without it

1000
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,439
but going forward we're not confident we

1001
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,119
will be able to continue these studies

1002
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,280
without that so that's why cbd spec or

1003
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,160
the radical spectrum is our last study

1004
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,680
um of any of our studies that allows cbd

1005
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,159
products to be enrolled so going forward

1006
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:23,440
we don't really have study slots or

1007
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,920
enrollment slots open to cbd products

1008
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,519
what about cbda

1009
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,119
that gets a little

1010
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,920
that could potentially that could

1011
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,358
potentially work it's not cbd so yes

1012
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,480
that could potentially work if there's a

1013
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,078
way that you can stabilize the cvda and

1014
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,719
show that it's not spontaneously

1015
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,960
converting to significant quantities of

1016
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,358
cbd and yes that could work

1017
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,838
interesting okay and the radical

1018
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,159
spectrum is will that data be made

1019
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,838
public or is that going to be um

1020
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,039
at the discretion of the brands that's

1021
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,000
going to be at the discretion of the

1022
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,880
brands

1023
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,679
so

1024
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,680
um

1025
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,679
but you know so far

1026
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,480
most if not all these brands have wanted

1027
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,000
to talk about their data because it it

1028
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,519
helps you know

1029
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,320
them it helps the industry it helps

1030
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,320
their own brand so

1031
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,720
excellent so and before you i let you go

1032
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,000
because you did bring it up um you're

1033
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,639
talking about exploring some of these

1034
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,079
other minor cannabinoids um

1035
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,239
interested to know

1036
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,640
um i i know you can only share so much

1037
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,719
but um what are you looking at

1038
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,078
in terms of you know those cannabinoids

1039
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,239
which ones are you looking at and what

1040
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,160
sort of conditions so we've already

1041
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:34,399
we've already run studies

1042
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:36,239
um on cbc cbg and cbn either by

1043
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,920
themselves or in combinations with other

1044
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,439
minor cannabinoids or in combinations

1045
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,880
with cbd

1046
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,679
we're about to start launching a series

1047
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,920
of studies on thcv

1048
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,480
in terms of cbc cbn cbg we've been

1049
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,680
running studies on them for things like

1050
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,800
anxiety

1051
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,639
and pain and sleep for the upcoming thcv

1052
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,760
studies it's going to be focused on

1053
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:59,598
energy focus and appetite suppression

1054
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,839
and then there's

1055
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,240
subsequent studies as well that are

1056
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:06,559
going to involve minor cannabinoids uh

1057
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,559
for areas like quality of life and mood

1058
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,239
and libido and things like that

1059
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,320
great and which

1060
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,319
in which of the minor cannabinoids do

1061
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,838
you think is sort of

1062
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,960
uh the next big minor cannabinoid

1063
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,719
um look honestly

1064
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,920
well how do i say this they're all

1065
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,239
pretty interesting because we're all

1066
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,280
starting from ground zero

1067
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,799
you know

1068
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,920
whatever people

1069
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,200
state to be true or not true about minor

1070
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,960
cannabinoids at least from human

1071
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,039
effectiveness data there's not really

1072
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,240
anything to go off of there just haven't

1073
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,800
been studies

1074
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,639
to prove or refute that any of these

1075
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,760
minor cannabinoids could help certain

1076
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,199
things so we're basically doing some of

1077
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,720
history's first

1078
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,598
not a sum up we are doing history's

1079
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,199
first

1080
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,200
human effectiveness randomized um

1081
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,639
blind to placebo-controlled trials

1082
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,919
to look at these things

1083
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,039
but one thing that i think is really

1084
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,720
interesting

1085
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,800
just from a from the zeitgeist at the

1086
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,639
moment everyone's talking about

1087
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,640
how you can get better energy everyone

1088
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,118
wants to take nootropics all this stuff

1089
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,118
so i think thcv gets pretty interesting

1090
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,320
where anecdotally you're hearing about

1091
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,039
these effects

1092
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,640
we do have human studies on thcv's

1093
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,159
ability to

1094
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,159
improve blood sugar levels

1095
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,358
so definitely is modulating metabolism

1096
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,719
and so i get really excited that we're

1097
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,400
going to launch these studies to see how

1098
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,000
it can really help with potentially

1099
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,639
focus potentially with energy and

1100
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,239
potentially with appetite suppression

1101
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,159
and if you think about a lot of things

1102
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:35,679
that americans are grappling with right

1103
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,559
now poor sleep poor sleep and your

1104
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:41,358
fatigue during the day or you're you're

1105
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:44,000
you have fatigue or you've

1106
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,719
long covered or you're not you know you

1107
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,559
have you're anxious and you can't focus

1108
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:52,159
right so the fact that thcv could

1109
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:53,679
potentially help some of these areas

1110
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,279
based on some of the

1111
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,879
the strong anecdotal data we're seeing

1112
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,079
that could really help improve a lot of

1113
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,519
people's lives

1114
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,359
who are having

1115
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,599
grappling with these issues and wanting

1116
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:06,480
better focus wanting more energy and

1117
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,640
potentially wanting to um suppress their

1118
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,199
appetite look i fast every day

1119
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,799
for longevity purposes for some people

1120
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,679
that's not achievable and other people

1121
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,320
might need to fast more because they

1122
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:21,199
have you know maybe gained some weight

1123
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,519
and we know that excess weight is

1124
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:26,078
tied to a whole host of deleterious

1125
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:28,960
health outcomes from increased risk of

1126
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,200
dementia to cardiovascular events

1127
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,240
so i really hope that we know we'll see

1128
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,598
what the studies show and if they're

1129
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,439
positive and these are tools that could

1130
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,240
really help a lot of people

1131
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,400
yeah absolutely a lot of potential there

1132
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,479
all right dr jeff before i let you go i

1133
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,760
want to give you an opportunity to plug

1134
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,559
any websites social media or additional

1135
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,640
resources that the listeners could

1136
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,400
engage with or read up on to learn more

1137
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,879
about what you guys are working on

1138
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,039
yeah so radical science we're here

1139
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,280
running disruptive direct-to-consumer

1140
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,599
clinical trials so

1141
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,280
non-prescription health products can

1142
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,039
accelerate their r d and substantiate

1143
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,040
their claims we can do it all 10 times

1144
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:11,119
cheaper and faster than anything that's

1145
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,119
been done before radical is spelled

1146
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:15,920
r-i-d-i-c-l-e kind of like particle and

1147
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,960
that spelling of radical means the root

1148
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,079
of a plant

1149
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,400
and that's what we're getting to we're

1150
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,240
getting to the root of

1151
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,639
these health issues we're getting to the

1152
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,239
truth behind all of these

1153
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,000
um and so it's radical science you can

1154
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,759
