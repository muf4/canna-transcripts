00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,200
hello i would like to thank quartergen

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,878
for the great hospitality and the

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,039
wonderful conference of course

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:13,759
and all of the sponsors as well um

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,638
my name is mark lewis founded in april

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,079
in

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:21,198
2011 and that was the result of

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:24,239
trying to do at home r d piggybacked

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,880
upon service laboratories in california

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:30,079
um i'd always known that you know i had

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:33,280
a fond appreciation for plants so

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:36,558
i'd always loved flavor and aroma and

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,280
high oil content whether it was basil or

14
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,919
cannabis and when i tried to do r d in

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,558
2007 i had all these issues because

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
i couldn't get any type of consistent

17
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,640
results

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,440
from lab lab so

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
in 2011 napro set out to accomplish

20
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,878
several tasks

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,198
and do them as quickly as possible the

22
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,558
first thing we wanted to do was

23
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,439
create a robust and reliable validated

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,679
assay

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,640
to look at and screen all of the

26
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,959
relevant terpenes

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,760
and as well as some of the not so

28
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:15,359
relevant or unknown ones but we end up

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,600
testing for and validating for 17 and

30
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,359
11 cannabinoids then be able to

31
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,039
communicate that data in a meaningful

32
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:25,118
way not only to

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,320
patients but also to plant breeders

34
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,759
or physicians or just

35
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,199
the canna sewer you know someone who

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,200
wants to learn more about the plant

37
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,959
during that time we collected a bunch of

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,159
data from 2011

39
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,118
2015 looking at

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
essentially the whole chemo scape of

41
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,478
what was

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
popular medicine in california at the

43
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,039
time

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
once we had that data set we did a few

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,720
different analysis on it the first

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,560
analysis was to

47
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,000
really analyze these cultivars see what

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
metabolites were present

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,718
and see if any um patterns formed in a

50
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,798
potentially like classification system

51
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,959
based on secondary metabolites

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,320
the second analysis was to observe a

53
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,799
single genotype

54
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,079
over many many replicates in the exact

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,840
same environment

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,760
to see if what the real you know metrics

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
are for consistency and quality to

58
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,318
establish

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:24,480
quality metrics for certain clients

60
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:28,238
analysis three uh we wanted to compare

61
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:31,280
homozygous hybrid seed with

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,599
the asexual clonal propagation to see if

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
the rsds from plant to plant could be

64
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,598
minimized versus the rsds from

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,919
lot to lot for the single genotype

66
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,919
the reason this is important is because

67
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,000
as you learn as a chemist

68
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,000
all systems can be defined by the

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
summation of your inputs and outputs

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
so garbage in equals garbage out and

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,719
that's for us if

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
if the medicine were taken we don't know

73
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,280
what it is i mean you can't black box

74
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,759
that

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,120
or for a plant if you're giving it

76
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,039
stimulus

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
either environmental or chemical you

78
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,639
have to make sure you know what those

79
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,958
are

80
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,199
so that you don't get a the garbage

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,200
piece

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,719
in 2011 we were provided a unique

83
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,119
opportunity

84
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,359
someone had a series of controlled

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,719
environment

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,959
production facilities and 56 known

87
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,080
cultivars by common name these cultivars

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,479
have been

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
you know grown by these same cultivators

90
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,359
for decades so we knew that

91
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,079
blue dream was blue dream and og was og

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,319
and

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,159
of course i have quite an experience

94
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,679
with the plant as well so

95
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:40,000
our team was able to match common name

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,640
with the actual genotype that was being

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,439
produced um which kind of flew in the

98
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,598
face of

99
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,560
some previous scientists who said what's

100
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,598
in a name

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,199
and essentially

102
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,598
you know there is a name game out there

103
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,199
because the marketplace demands cookies

104
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,119
you have to have cookies so if you don't

105
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,280
have cookies it suddenly becomes cookies

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,519
when it moves across a state line

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,120
and the further you get across you know

108
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,519
the further the variation becomes

109
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,719
so the the thought here was well let's

110
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
figure this out

111
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,400
let's look at how cultivating in the

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,158
same environment over and over again

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,560
affects a single genotype

114
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,279
and and let's do this thing like like

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
real people

116
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,559
real scientists so i'm gonna go through

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,478
some of the data that we collected and

118
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,879
explain why it was good data

119
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,199
and and that's because we made took

120
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,199
painstaking efforts to ensure that

121
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
the lighting was the same the the

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
headspace above the light was the same

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,720
the rooms were the same dimension

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,520
the tables were the same the soil was

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,000
sourced from the same vendors

126
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,519
same techniques and and all that stuff

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,879
and napro oversaw

128
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,799
the entire project we collected climate

129
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,319
metrics over the course of the entire

130
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,520
lifespan of the plant

131
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,959
um making sure to produce control charts

132
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,279
something that people in the industry

133
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,918
often kind of have that starry deer eyed

134
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,799
look when you say so that if there were

135
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,439
out of bounds

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
situations you could eliminate that from

137
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,680
the data set as

138
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,160
a flaw similarly with the

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,600
nutrient metrics we monitored what went

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
into the soil system what went on the

141
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
leaves

142
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,240
and made sure that it was consistent and

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,079
the same across all batches

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,800
even if we were spiking humic acid on

145
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,680
day 40 it needed to be day 40 every time

146
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,520
and this is all part of the ge equals

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,879
your phenotype chemotype equation that's

148
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,000
shown there so what we try to do is

149
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,120
minimize that

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,120
delta e of part of the equation

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,800
and then that produced the phenotype and

152
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,879
we measured those metrics via

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,199
tape measure size of the bud height of

154
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,199
the flower

155
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,120
biomass um you know pretty

156
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,960
standard took pictures along the way so

157
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,399
that it looked nice when you went from

158
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,719
page to page i don't know what the

159
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,079
pictures do other than that

160
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,039
but the next piece was a little bit more

161
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,038
tricky we had to

162
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,560
actually collect the data from the

163
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,639
chemotype stuff right

164
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,240
so there wasn't any testing laboratory

165
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,759
out that was really doing terpenes at

166
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,720
the time everyone was just

167
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
dabbling in it a little bit so what we

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,479
sought out to do

169
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,918
was develop this methodology we paid to

170
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,719
make it open source

171
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,599
so anyone starting a laboratory anywhere

172
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,000
can

173
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,919
download this guideline from sample prep

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,800
to your analysis and you can get

175
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:24,159
reliable data for

176
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,400
the cost of an hplc and a gcfid

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,000
we answered a lot of tough questions

178
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,318
sample prep

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,759
extract stability i mean intraday some

180
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
of these matrices have

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,680
degradation of certain terpenoids and

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,439
formation of other ones so

183
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,079
let's be really careful it's all about

184
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,079
the rsd

185
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,600
so just take a look at our material in

186
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,079
data flow so you know that we

187
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,199
thought about it a little bit we looked

188
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,719
at a living plant we took the

189
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,000
morphological data combine it with the

190
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,759
environmental data

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
took a sample followed it through the

192
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,280
drying curing process

193
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,560
collected that data in this particular

194
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,478
show we're going to talk about the tier

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,280
1 assays we did which is a single

196
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:06,800
extraction in ethanol to create

197
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,478
samples we have to do one dilution for

198
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,720
the cannabinoids

199
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,478
as you know cannabinoids less than two

200
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,720
percent greater than 30 percent falls

201
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,399
outside the line of beer's law so

202
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
you have to do that dilution a lot of

203
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,758
people weren't doing dilutions in 2011

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,598
they were just shotgun blasting it

205
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,840
so we knew that there was rsds

206
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:27,038
associated on one side of the curve

207
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,239
or the other which could explain the the

208
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,879
um

209
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,598
conformational bias of the increasing

210
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,719
amount of thc found in flowers through

211
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,879
2000 to 2015 because there was 36

212
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,919
one it was crazy so then we put that in

213
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,399
a database

214
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,758
um create an analysis create our control

215
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,478
charts and then

216
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,560
it says mcf sheets that was a really old

217
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,839
name for what we call a phytofax report

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
a report that kind of

219
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,159
gives you a flash of what that cultivar

220
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
is

221
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,960
so to name a few of the 56 cultivars we

222
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,240
examined in this

223
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:05,758
there's everything from pinterest creek

224
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,598
old amsterdam classic train wreck

225
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,120
everything that you can imagine is on

226
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,038
there and those are

227
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
that's girl scout cookies on the left if

228
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,598
you're curious and candyland on the

229
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
right

230
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,719
i thought i'd make the presentation fun

231
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,318
by putting pictures of buds up there

232
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,520
because we haven't seen any yet

233
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,720
it's all been really heavy you know i

234
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,359
forgot my joke

235
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,160
oh my gosh thank you thank you thank you

236
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,120
you never remember

237
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,720
the rainbow at the very beginning

238
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,120
there's a greenhouse full of weed at the

239
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
end of it

240
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,839
it really was so the first thing we

241
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,200
looked at was total cannabinoid

242
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,800
concentration across the entire

243
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,719
population of 56

244
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,799
this is kind of the distribution here

245
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
you know we had we had a max of 36

246
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,000
or so percent cannabinoids in a min of

247
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,319
10 with you know

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,120
an average of around 20 which kind of

249
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,800
jives with what everyone's saying

250
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,519
of lot rsds you know average about 12

251
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,079
and we found that the highly sampled

252
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,120
cultivars had locked a lot rsds of 10 to

253
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,240
20 percent

254
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,320
which kind of you know arno has comp's

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,200
number of 15 percent falls right in the

256
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,720
middle there

257
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
um we've seen some things have more

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,200
variability

259
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,600
and some things have less and we just

260
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,000
started to wonder is that

261
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,040
do the things have less variability have

262
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,679
less of a

263
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,919
environmental impact maybe more stable

264
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,639
somehow with the environment

265
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,479
so when we went to look at terpenes

266
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,080
total terpene concentration range from

267
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,959
about half a percent to two and a half

268
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,519
percent

269
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,239
with a mean is about 1.5 percent and

270
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,799
this is

271
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,080
in indoor under artificial lights just

272
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,199
to be clear

273
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,278
a lot a lot rsds were increased

274
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,640
for the terpenes which kind of

275
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,519
symbolized that the

276
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,679
terpene biosynthetic pathways are more

277
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,000
influenced by epigenetic factors

278
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,079
and overall we found that cannabinoid

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
content was more stable than terpenoid

280
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,278
content between

281
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,879
locked a lot one of the

282
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,600
things that this brought up was well is

283
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,439
there a correlation between

284
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,120
high terpene production and high

285
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,760
cannabinoid production

286
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,759
and when we looked at that we saw that

287
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,399
there is indeed a correlation between

288
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,319
higher

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,559
essential oil production and higher

290
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,278
cannabinoid production however

291
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,639
the correlation factor is really low

292
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,879
that means that only about

293
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:29,838
15 percent of the factors influencing

294
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,078
the terpene content derive from the

295
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,000
cannabinoid content which means that 85

296
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,359
percent of that is coming from somewhere

297
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,399
else whether it's genetic or

298
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,159
environmental

299
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,000
we don't know the correlation is real

300
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,838
just really tiny

301
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
but what does that tell us about each

302
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,399
individual unique cultivar

303
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,560
and how someone can use this tool to be

304
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
able to treat specific ailments because

305
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,679
you know everyone says well what's

306
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,919
what's in a terpene

307
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,799
you know dustin uh started talking about

308
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,439
lineal wall

309
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,799
increasing efficacy mara talked about

310
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,600
the entourage effect

311
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,159
thanks to dr mitchulum for coining the

312
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,200
phrase

313
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,120
and it's it's like we have to look at

314
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,920
each individual terpene

315
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,078
so we created this really really oops i

316
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,278
skipped a slide forgot here's the

317
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:18,159
whole spectrum of plants from the low

318
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,720
concentration of thc to high

319
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,759
low terpenes to high and they're in four

320
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,879
letter codes so it doesn't tell you a

321
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,720
whole lot i'm just showing you the

322
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,159
spread

323
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,079
but the individual terpenes themselves

324
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,639
would colored with

325
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,679
color coordinated so that they would be

326
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,360
intuitive

327
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,399
but also informative and create what we

328
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,560
call a phytoprint

329
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,159
it's essentially the fingerprint of a

330
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,559
particular plant

331
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,958
we started this with basil and this

332
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:48,000
slide actually had basil where the um

333
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,000
the the the buds are now and

334
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,120
sometimes i think about if we could grow

335
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,200
a bud that big

336
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,879
how that might be pretty incredible

337
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,800
um especially after drying could you

338
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,278
imagine how big it would be on the plant

339
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,919
it's crazy um but this is this is nice

340
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,720
so

341
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,559
essentially terpinoline is red osamine

342
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
is orange limonene is yellow pinene's

343
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,119
green

344
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,879
mircine is purple and a little lavender

345
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,039
so they're all intuitive

346
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,639
you can create collateral that you know

347
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,958
color matches and it shows

348
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,759
different types of effects that these

349
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,439
things do

350
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,399
but more importantly you can look at

351
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,240
different cultivars and compare them

352
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,240
and you have a couple examples here

353
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,440
but essentially if you if you look at

354
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
the major

355
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,600
terpenes that are produced by the plant

356
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,839
they really class off pretty quickly

357
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,720
either you have one major terpene two or

358
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,800
three

359
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,120
it's more rare to have four or five or

360
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,799
six all equal amounts so

361
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,959
if you look at bubba kush east coast

362
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,240
sarah diesel and crypto they both have

363
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,958
high amounts of limonene and

364
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,560
caryophylline however

365
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,278
you can see the mir scene in the lineal

366
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,359
wall disappears in crypto which

367
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,919
those subtle minor differences are how

368
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,360
you differentiate the subtleties between

369
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,679
each cultivar

370
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,720
across the bottom you have classic perps

371
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,159
blue dream 2

372
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,000
and it's just 2 because there are

373
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,000
multiple cups of blue dream

374
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,839
which i'm sure quarterfin knows about

375
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
and then old amsterdam

376
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,839
just a different purple class we call

377
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,560
this purple class because

378
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,920
before we put science behind it we used

379
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,919
our indigenous knowledge

380
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,199
all the purples tended to be mere scene

381
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,159
dominant but we just call them purples

382
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,839
because they're purple and then it

383
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,799
turned out that it

384
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,320
worked out in our color scheme thank god

385
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,679
problematic if it didn't

386
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,519
but you can see the subtle differences

387
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,719
here in the pinene and the caryophylline

388
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,159
between the different cultivars and

389
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,120
that's how you really differentiate each

390
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,879
cultivar

391
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,679
but they're all really within these

392
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:42,639
three cultivars are across two classes

393
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,759
um if we look at some archetypes and

394
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,198
these are uh

395
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,639
you know there's a terpenoline dominant

396
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,240
that's associated with like your train

397
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,799
wreck

398
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,278
limonene dominant this particular is an

399
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,078
og

400
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,000
that's a og legend mir scene dominant

401
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,439
that's purple anything that was cbd

402
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,839
prior to

403
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,079
2014 was pretty much all mere scene

404
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,560
dominant

405
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,120
osamine dominant this is a hawaiian

406
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,638
plant

407
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,399
i mean some of these things produce like

408
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,600
two percent of a single

409
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,440
terpenoid pinene dominance beta

410
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,959
cariophylline dominance

411
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,040
and terpenes are important because beta

412
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,919
carotene actually is a cb2

413
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,319
agonist so if you're only testing for

414
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,198
cannabinoids and you're giving your

415
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,639
child a preparation you should be very

416
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,599
cognizant to the fact that

417
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,440
when you concentrate this co2 anything

418
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,159
you lose your monoterps but you usually

419
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,079
get a

420
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,159
ton of the karyophylenes whether it's

421
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,759
alpha or beta

422
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,278
they're there they're present so you

423
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,039
should be aware of that and if you

424
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,399
hybridize two of these like the pinene

425
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,198
group and the myrsine group you'll get

426
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,278
something that

427
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,679
kind of looks in between the two or a

428
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,838
combination of the two

429
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,319
this is interesting because you know you

430
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,880
create custom medicines this way right

431
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,160
and if you could just buy seed that was

432
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,720
the medicine you wanted instead of uh

433
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,919
what would you call the lottery you know

434
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,199
you don't know what you're going to get

435
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,919
it's like a box of chocolates

436
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,958
so when we do a dendogram of this

437
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,559
chemical data

438
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:15,439
you get a nice breakup of hierarchy

439
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,838
we call it the terpene superclass system

440
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,800
it's just based on metabolites so

441
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,880
if pinein is in the major terpene world

442
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,759
and those cultivars fall in that family

443
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,679
branch

444
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,000
limonene caryophyllene as such

445
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,838
mercinosamina terpenoline

446
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,759
interestingly limonene and keraflain are

447
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,600
seem to be quite coupled and osamine and

448
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,560
myrcene quite coupled in the plant

449
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,440
so lots of neat trends you see here but

450
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,000
just

451
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,600
showing some stuff and from that bore

452
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,159
the classification system where we

453
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,839
wanted to do away with indic and sativa

454
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:52,078
because we we don't really care about

455
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,600
20 years ago or 100 000 years ago we

456
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,599
care about right now and what it's going

457
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,759
to tell our patients so

458
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,759
if you use a simple alpha system here to

459
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,600
outline what the top three terpenes are

460
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,440
in this case it's limonene caryophyllene

461
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,000
and myrcin for lcm

462
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,000
one means it's a type one plant and g

463
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
means that cannabidiolic acid is the

464
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
second most abundant cannabinoid

465
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,440
then you have a quick cartridge of

466
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,800
five-digit item code that would work in

467
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,120
a qr system

468
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,109
for inventorying at dispensaries and

469
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,360
totally removes the common name game

470
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,240
[Music]

471
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,680
this led to having to do a pca analysis

472
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,000
on the data points to make sure that our

473
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,239
classification system would hold water

474
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,839
and as you can see it did the ellipses

475
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,320
are really great

476
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,279
clustering for different chemo types if

477
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,399
you

478
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,958
notice the the purple here the blue

479
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,679
dreams

480
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,039
there's also kins gdp thrown in here and

481
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,599
there's actually three cuts of blue

482
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,120
dream

483
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,879
then you have headband and several

484
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,120
different og's you have purple train

485
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:54,159
wreck and classic train wreck and then

486
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,320
so it's not just the same genotype

487
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,759
well it may be based on the world but we

488
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,278
know that the train wreck ones aren't

489
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,159
because one was purple and one was not

490
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,198
so

491
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,159
um the point is is that this this

492
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,639
the system works however some genotypes

493
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,160
have too much lot to lot variability

494
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,319
and over the course of say 40 or 80 runs

495
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
you you have this plant that slides from

496
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,720
one or two different classes right

497
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,319
in this case we're looking at o.g kush

498
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,679
another great picture of a wonderful

499
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,558
flower

500
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,559
it's an mcl one t-class as we designate

501
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,199
it internally that's mercin karaokeline

502
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,119
limonene

503
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,880
these things have two percent chirps

504
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:34,000
always and greater than 25

505
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,000
cannabinoids it's truly a beast ogs are

506
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,880
marked by equal amounts of limonene

507
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,400
karyophylline and myrsine

508
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,200
quite regularly but if you look at these

509
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,440
this phytoprint over say a dozen or so

510
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,038
runs you have a separation of a couple

511
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,720
different classes here where

512
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,400
sometimes the limonene is dominant

513
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,200
sometimes the the keratophyllene is

514
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,880
dominant

515
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,558
and then you have this mirror scene

516
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,559
dominance across here

517
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,558
all of this is highly contingent upon

518
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,200
environment and time of harvest of

519
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,558
course

520
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,319
and post-harvest conditioning so

521
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,720
you can have terpenes degrade to other

522
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,639
things so the point here is that quality

523
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
control and laboratory integration with

524
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,759
production

525
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,319
is absolutely essential and the idea of

526
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,079
having

527
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,918
third-party laboratory services that you

528
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,000
send samples to is kind of like

529
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,679
ah to me because it doesn't make sense

530
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,319
unless you're just making pure extracts

531
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,919
and then you're still

532
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,519
waiting in a holding pattern for your

533
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,280
results and

534
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,480
not even guaranteed if they're correct

535
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,399
and if you have to send it to three

536
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,839
different laboratories oh my gosh and

537
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,720
then how do you pick which one do you

538
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,439
average them

539
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,079
i don't think so so complicated

540
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,759
especially

541
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,000
i mean this is the same genotype same

542
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,558
environment over and over

543
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,079
if we look at a control chart here for

544
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,000
total terpene content and total

545
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,798
cannabinoid content

546
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,160
with we ran a little experiment just

547
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:51,440
trying to check out i'm trying to speed

548
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,798
up here

549
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,558
check out the difference between organic

550
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,359
practices plus biostimulants

551
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,639
which biostimulants are that biome thing

552
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,678
that kevin was talking about at the

553
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,759
beginning

554
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,320
well if we take away the biostimulants

555
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,319
and just do organic practices we have

556
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,918
we see a significant decrease in both

557
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,279
terpenes production

558
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,799
and cannabinoid production the producers

559
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,399
didn't like that very much so we had to

560
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,079
quickly change that's why there's only a

561
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
few data sets there and then we went to

562
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,839
conventional

563
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,519
agriculture salts moved assaults away

564
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,240
from organic practices

565
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,319
and brought the biostimulant back and we

566
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,200
got a boost in thc compared to the

567
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,000
baseline

568
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,160
and a decrease in terpenes so it was

569
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,319
very interesting for us to

570
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,919
as it confirmed what the grower said all

571
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,759
along they had to do it this way to get

572
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,160
the oiliest tastiest

573
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,319
products but at the same time there's a

574
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,320
neat way to boost your thc by switching

575
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,240
the salts

576
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,159
this variability in cannabis brings up

577
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,200
the quality question

578
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,558
the industry seriously lacks qaqc

579
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,480
most producers don't even have

580
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,558
established quality metrics

581
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,400
i mean it's like you have to have size

582
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:58,960
of a if it's a flower you have to have

583
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,280
size

584
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,400
shape color all these things most people

585
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,000
don't consider

586
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,600
the only seed on the market you can buy

587
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,640
that's true breeding

588
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:11,359
currently is cannabis seed and it may

589
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,280
not even be in most cases

590
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,719
unlike corn you can't just buy a disease

591
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,440
resistant og

592
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,558
or a bi-colored kush so

593
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,120
but people are making advances and one

594
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,279
of our

595
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,319
clients wanted to make a type 2 train

596
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,279
wreck because

597
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,839
this particular person had anxiety and

598
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,119
she felt that jack rare really made her

599
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,079
you know feel calm and she wanted a type

600
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,558
2 version this

601
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,158
a train wreck is really a txx1g class

602
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,000
which means it's trapinaline dominant

603
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,840
type one with canon hydraulic acid is

604
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,839
the second most abundant cannabinoid

605
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,119
that's a picture of the classic train

606
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:51,359
wreck right there

607
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,639
very very specific morphology

608
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,558
when you look at total cannabinoid

609
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,000
concentration across all the individuals

610
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,720
in the class it's really nice and

611
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,400
homozygous all at about one to two

612
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,000
i was going to say that we do everything

613
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,679
exactly backwards

614
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,079
we'll start from the plant you start

615
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,240
from the human the humans say cbd to thc

616
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,480
and the plant breeders say thc to cbd

617
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,839
so such is life but if you look at the

618
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,440
terpenes

619
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,959
it's beautiful they're all in the same

620
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,759
class

621
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,519
in this particular uh data set there was

622
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,798
like 70 individuals but

623
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,639
i didn't want to clutter to the screen

624
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,720
with fido prints

625
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,320
the point is is that things are changing

626
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,120
in the world of propagation

627
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,599
and we should start thinking about this

628
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,000
because the

629
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,158
rsds from plant to plant here were less

630
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,240
than the rsds of a single cultivar from

631
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,159
lot a lot

632
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
this begs up the question of indica

633
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,919
versus sativa again

634
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,679
i don't know i think it might be better

635
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,159
used as an effects gauge than a

636
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,660
genealogical nomenclature in the current

637
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,280
system of medicine not taxonomy

638
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,558
[Music]

639
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,918
so end on a set of sample reports i was

640
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,759
talking about before

641
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,759
where you have the top terpenes

642
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,839
color-coded at the top and the bottom to

643
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,400
give you a feeling of the plant

644
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,158
total cannabinoids terps and moisture

645
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
content along with the class

646
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,520
a picture of the flowers that you can

647
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,000
visually identify the product tested

648
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,319
with the product on the shelf

649
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,359
we have suggested entourage effects that

650
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,480
are based on

651
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:23,279
algorithms and patient panels

652
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,759
done over the course of 2011 to 2015

653
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,200
a little flavor spider graph just a

654
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,720
really cool way to do it

655
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,319
warm tones are typically more

656
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,079
stimulating cool tones are typically

657
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,558
more sedating so it's a

658
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,798
very intuitive system so that's how you

659
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:36,798
have it

660
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,839
thanks

661
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,759
you
