1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,440
hi everybody how you doing

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,919
for a while you're going to be stuck

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,638
with me for a full hour just about we

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:15,759
had some challenges and i cannot thank

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:18,079
my panel enough for

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,960
being organized stepping up and being

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,959
here

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,800
we're going to do a short short

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,480
introduction and i'm going to look at

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,160
the av guys do we have the um

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
aware go

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,880
so all i have to do is click

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,239
awesome so that's a good way to start

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,200
this um

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,000
the goal for today actually is going to

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,160
be

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,960
discussing broadly

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,479
these specific topics about cannabis

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,439
tissue culture in general we're going to

20
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,359
give

21
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,199
kind of a brief background we're going

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,399
to talk about some of the challenges

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,480
opportunities and what we see the future

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,799
and before i go into any of the other

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,718
slides i wanted to turn it over to the

26
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,479
panelists to introduce themselves in

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,800
hopes that you guys can get an idea of

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,238
who's speaking with you today and start

29
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,438
thinking about some questions and how

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,840
you might want to direct them and then

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,438
i'll take us through a couple other

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,640
slides and i'm going to sit down with

33
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,719
them and we'll just kind of take it

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,200
topic by topic so justin you want to

35
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,599
start us off yeah sure my name is justin

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,280
gibbons i'm the ceo and founder of

37

cannabis native

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,039
i've been through all of it to good bad

40
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,118
and ugly

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
at apical biotech we're essentially

42
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,560
trying to bridge the gap between legacy

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,240
farmers and growers and the scientific

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,079
groups that are coming into cannabis now

45
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,078
that it's more legal

46
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,319
my name is matthew schneider i got my

47
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,118
masters in agronomy from the university

48
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,679
of florida and i currently am a tissue

49
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,040
culture r d scientist at apical biotech

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,040
with justin

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,479
i have spent well over 20 000 hours

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,118
inside of the hood

53
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,920
done many thousands of meristem tip

54
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:10,000
isolations and have provenably cleaned

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,598
hoplaton viroid from cannabis cultivars

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,318
hi i'm karl rave i'm a phd implant

57
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,079
molecular biologist i got my phd from

58
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,639
the french national institute of

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
agronomy and then came to the us at

60
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,958
colorado state university where i worked

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
in plant nutrition on some biotechnology

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,360
aspects

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,959
since uh 13 years now and more recently

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
i joined tesorogenetics which is a

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,080
company we are characterizing existing

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,640
genotypes and breeding for little

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,640
varieties

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,280
thank you gentlemen and

69
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,959
i'm dr hope jones i've been in the

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,239
cannabis industry for

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,719
just under 10 years and i have had the

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,480
pleasure and the opportunity to bring

73
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,359
my background in controlled environment

74
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,878
ag

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,599
also as a molecular and cellular

76
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,199
biologist to this industry and and

77
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,759
really i'm a grower

78
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,679
i'm a grower at heart everything that i

79
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:09,359
do in my industry is about growing and

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,560
i also even when i'm doing a lot of my

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,360
legislative work i have the mindset of

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
cultivation and growers and mind and

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,640
heart because

84
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,799
in my opinion

85
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,479
everything downstream or upstream

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
however you want to think of it is

87
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,878
dependent on our genetics

88
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,079
everything we do in this industry is

89
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,000
about this plant yes the retail is what

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,159
drives the money

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,318
but in order to have the best business

92
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,759
possible we've got to have the best

93
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,759
genetics

94
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,679
health and cultivation practices

95
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,598
possible especially as our margins start

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,719
to get more competitive

97
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,039
so then

98
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,439
this is kind of like a day in the week

99
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,158
for most of us here um

100
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,639
the the focus on um

101
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,878
why we're here it's exciting cannabis we

102
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,438
obviously have this huge market right we

103
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,399
are talking a lot about clinical studies

104
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,280
the

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,400
the medical potential to help thousands

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
or millions we have research

107
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,680
like low-hanging fruit we've never had

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,319
before because we have this plant

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,239
that this one plant in the entire planet

110
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,159
that seems to have

111
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,879
so many effects

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,720
um on not just human populations but

113
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,959
mammals in general et cetera we have

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,160
hundreds of cannabinoids yet we still

115
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,000
have to

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,680
better understand their roles and

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,279
characterize

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
and then we have to understand we're

119
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:37,359
dealing with a lot of problems

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,680
we're a brand new industry legally and

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,960
we are here on the shoulders of

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,879
everybody who had this clandestine

123
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,478
industry before us

124
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,800
and now we're coming together and

125
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:52,560
learning to be commercial producers

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,960
retail markets brands and so you know we

127
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,879
it it's kind of a nice problem to have

128
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,519
but we have a lot of them that we need

129
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,159
to deal with and we don't have

130
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,038
the academic understanding you know

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,439
decades and decades if not you know 50

132
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,959
to 100 years of research like we do for

133
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,759
orchids and a lot of these other

134
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,959
products

135
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,400
other plants

136
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,638
so yeah these are new crop problems

137
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,239
specifically are genetics and i'm going

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,240
to just go through these and we're going

139
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,120
to this is what i'm hoping we can kind

140
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,879
of have a conversation about this is not

141
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,879
just the four bullet points that i had

142
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,879
on the slide but this is really what we

143
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,478
get into when we think about what we

144
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,000
have to deal with from the genetic

145
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,079
perspective

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,120
everything about those genetics needs to

147
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,599
um we need to understand epigenetics and

148
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,680
what that means and how that affects our

149
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,919
decline

150
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,079
we need to also understand the best and

151
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,159
practice the best cultivation practices

152
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,439
that we can and we're we're not quite

153
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,120
there

154
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,839
and then we have pest and disease

155
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,038
pressures like we've never seen before

156
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,198
and i have a theory as to why that is

157
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,879
and we're going to talk in some retail

158
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
but when you're in the black market and

159
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,240
you're growing um underground and you're

160
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,319
growing on a much smaller scale

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
and you are isolated

162
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,400
you're isolated from other populations

163
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,680
your other people very few people walk

164
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,519
in your grows

165
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,918
i can tell you on a daily basis the

166
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,079
number of tours that owners do through

167
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,399
their cultivation facilities is very

168
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,519
different than back in the day

169
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,000
and

170
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,758
as this is a nascent industry the idea

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,319
of putting on

172
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,400
ppe or the protective equipment before

173
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,240
giving the shows and the tours

174
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,560
making sure that we understand how to

175
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,199
properly deal with our tools etc all of

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,160
those things matter and lead to our

177
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,439
problems that we have to deal with and

178
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,080
the link

179
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,598
on what that has to do with the medical

180
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,959
the research the yields the

181
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,598
bottom line

182
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,000
all of our problems as a with this plant

183
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,439
and as growers affects everybody in this

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,959
industry so

185
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,478
we're here to talk about what some of

186
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,758
those solutions are going to be and

187
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,120
that's where we're going to talk about

188
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,038
some of the tissue culture pros

189
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,840
we're going to talk about when it comes

190
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,000
to a tissue culture laboratory

191
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,519
whether it's yours you're interested in

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,680
it or whether you're looking to do

193
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,758
business with a company because that's

194
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,319
going to be one of the more

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,400
common practices happening around

196
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,560
what should we all be thinking about

197
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,239
what kind of questions do we

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
might we think about because you're the

199
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
consumer at that you're the customer if

200
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,360
you're talking to a company what kind of

201
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,598
questions might you be wanting to know

202
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,598
ask and then how is a real facility

203
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:41,360
being operated and run

204
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,360
and then once you have these

205
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,918
this technology these skills what else

206
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,680
can we do with those tools okay and then

207
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,560
um there's going to be some discussion

208
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,160
on a call to action afterwards so that's

209
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,000
i'm going to come back to this slide in

210
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,560
just a second

211
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,319
but again the whole idea is we all want

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,160
to get to quality

213
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,879
high consistent

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,199
reliable product and we want the best

215
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,759
research and development that we can for

216
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:15,199
our clinical medical

217
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,199
outputs and so what we deal with though

218
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,720
right now where we're at

219
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,719
is this playing you think

220
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,840
could you guys maybe hit that um

221
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,840
i bet i can't do it

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,840
i love how we just read each other like

223
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,070
[Music]

224
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,278
up late and free

225
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,519
[Laughter]

226
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,439
and then uh this is justin's by the way

227
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,759
so this is a perfect lead into the panel

228
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,240
real secret to removing hot plate and

229
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,240
burrowing

230
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:18,159
that was a couple days later

231
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,399
so we have a lot of misconceptions in

232
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,838
the industry and i'm going to let him

233
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,278
follow through on the story there

234
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,680
and talk about yourselves we're going to

235
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,159
kind of uh just take it maybe one by one

236
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,039
and then we're going to

237
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,439
go back a few slides and in the meantime

238
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,958
why justin tells us the

239
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,640
history i'm gonna leave that there for

240
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,479
right now so why don't you tell us what

241
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,480
was going on with that

242
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,720
so there's a lot of misconceptions going

243
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,159
around about what can and can happen

244
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,399
with uh virus and vroid eradication and

245
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,000
or remediation and cannabis tissue

246
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,919
culture

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,879
there early on i would say there was a

248
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,199
lot of bad testing first so

249
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,078
knowing what hop latent droid was and

250
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,920
being able to reliably test for it

251
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:04,958
without having false positives or false

252
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,399
negatives

253
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,799
was um

254
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,159
probably that 2017 2018

255
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,278
and

256
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,719
you know

257
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,600
a lot of people didn't know about it so

258
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,200
now the community is really

259
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,240
much more educated on it and there's a

260
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,360
lot more testing labs testing for it and

261
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,440
availability to access those

262
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
unlike before

263
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,320
but

264
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,320
remediating it

265
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,200
cannabis suffers from

266
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,640
maybe some antidotal

267
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,600
or observational um hunches

268
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,000
and maybe some folklore

269
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
maybe maybe

270
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,879
so

271
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,120
simply put it

272
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:54,159
meristematic excision does it reliably

273
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,360
it's just about technique and

274
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,078
numbers

275
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,839
there's been a lot of people that have

276
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,919
all kinds of different ideas that idea

277
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,680
stemmed from

278
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,919
we heard a client

279
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:09,039
say they can clean it in two days

280
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:12,240
and they were using gamma irradiation

281
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:15,759
and i was like okay well

282
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,519
i'll believe it when i see it uh but uh

283
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,078
you know the mutations that would

284
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,320
probably happen right as you just look

285
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,759
at white papers of several other crops

286
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,360
that they've done that in and they

287
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,799
actually wanted the mutations see what

288
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
else they could produce

289
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,078
so that that's where that video stems

290
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,399
from but

291
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,399
cannabis just suffers a lot of that

292
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,519
misinformation and we're really trying

293
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,278
hard to combat that

294
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,759
thank you and i think it was a nice

295
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,838
humorous way to be able to illustrate

296
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,838
it's one thing to try something it's

297
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,800
another thing to maybe believe it

298
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,360
because it's online

299
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,319
more about the meristematic

300
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,399
versus nodal i'm wondering matt if you

301
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,879
wanted to you do this on a day to day

302
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,078
one of the advantages of having you on

303
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,159
this panel is um so matt comes to us

304
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,078
he's been doing tissue culture for a

305
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,159
long time but coming into the cannabis

306
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,479
industry i'd also like to hear about

307
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,919
your learn curve in that regard

308
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,600
as well

309
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,000
yeah so

310
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,480
like i said earlier i got my masters at

311
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,839
university of florida and there i worked

312
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,399
on the genetic transformation of

313
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
sugarcane

314
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:30,000
and the

315
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,480
methods of which i learned there are

316
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,639
not exactly applicable to cannabis

317
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,079
propagation micropropagation that i've

318
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,000
learned here

319
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:42,319
there are a lot of academic standards

320
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that are taught that

321
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,000
many people just kind of take on face

322
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,879
value and think can be applied to every

323
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,799
single crop out there

324
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,278
general purpose

325
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,199
topics like asymptotic technique of

326
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,278
operating inside of a laminar flow hood

327
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,800
not contaminating your cultures

328
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,919
definitely

329
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:04,399
applicable and my time

330
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,360
in academia definitely helped learn that

331
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,720
but i also had to untrain myself with a

332
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,120
lot of

333
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,759
practices that i learned in academia

334
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,919
namely just the way that different crops

335
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,679
grow in tissue culture the way you have

336
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,599
to plant them inside of the media the

337
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,199
different types of excisions you have to

338
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
do

339
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,399
now with my time at apical i've spent a

340
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,399
lot of time doing meristem tip excision

341
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,200
which is the primary method through

342
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,480
which we remediate hop latent viroid and

343
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,800
systemic bacterial infections

344
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,600
this requires you to get underneath a

345
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:45,039
dissection scope and

346
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,079
peel back the layers of the meristem tip

347
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,838
in order to isolate a non-vascular

348
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,838
portion of the plant

349
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,800
now it's critical to get a non-vascular

350
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,199
portion

351
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,679
because the vasculature the xylem and

352
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,399
the phloem are where viruses and the

353
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,638
virus and systemic bacteria live

354
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,078
so if you make a cut through this

355
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,000
vasculature

356
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,719
for example nodal propagation

357
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,559
traditional cloning or an improperly

358
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
excised meristem

359
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,518
you are just further propagating the

360
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,879
systemic pathogens inside the plant onto

361
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,879
your clean plant

362
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,479
then

363
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,639
you have to grow up your plant you have

364
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,720
to test it repeatedly through a

365
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,440
quantitative pcr

366
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,240
and not only do you have to test it once

367
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,440
you have to test it multiple times

368
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,879
over a long duration of time

369
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,600
previous presenters talked about low

370
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:46,159
viral loads inside of plants

371
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,360
and this can absolutely be true in the

372
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,360
tissue culture plants as well

373
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,199
if you have a really low titer level

374
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,278
inside of your tissue culture plant and

375
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,278
you test and you sample that plant

376
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,919
improperly

377
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:02,399
you might find that it is a false

378
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,278
negative but if you test that plant

379
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,480
three six nine months later after it's

380
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,639
grown

381
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,278
you'll find that the hoplite environ has

382
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,399
come back it was never actually removed

383
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,120
and

384
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,519
this is a problem that i think is

385
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,679
relatively common in the industry where

386
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,919
people are claiming to remediate hoplite

387
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,198
and viroid but still putting out dirty

388
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,278
plants

389
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:31,198
you know i think it's interesting um

390
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:33,360
that and because this is a new um

391
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,838
everything about doing any biotechnology

392
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,759
with cannabis is fairly new so any

393
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,560
evidence that we have or a lack of

394
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,399
evidence it seems like we have to infer

395
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,319
based off of what's happening with other

396
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,078
closely related crops

397
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,079
and i do wonder if

398
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,959
given the fact that we don't have most

399
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,360
of the groups

400
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,758
well i know all of us up here we're not

401
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,600
academics in the sense that we're at a

402
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,919
university and we're pi's running our

403
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,759
own grants and my god i was just

404
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,519
literally drooling looking at punjab's

405
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,320
pictures and

406
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,278
i had i enjoyed doing the collaborations

407
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,399
with the universities but we don't have

408
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,480
those technologies so we're looking at

409
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,919
how many times do we need to test this

410
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
talking to the

411
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,559
uh third-party labs and trying to

412
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,399
understand how they validate their

413
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,439
testing methods

414
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,679
and

415
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,519
the companies that i use and you guys

416
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,879
tell me about the labs for testing for

417
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,399
these diseases

418
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,480
first of all they're not going to be

419
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,720
necessarily the same labs as your

420
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,039
compliance labs

421
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,800
and then to get them to talk to us about

422
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,039
how they validate i don't need to know

423
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,879
primer sequences but you should be able

424
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,919
to have a conversation with me when it's

425
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,720
been validated so i see our industry in

426
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,439
the same situation that the analytical

427
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,959
labs were in the earlier days and trying

428
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,560
to get our methods validated or at least

429
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,799
understood or

430
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,319
all on the same page do you guys find

431
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,639
that you have that same challenge

432
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,640
running your facilities or

433
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,038
in the past when you have

434
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,120
oh yeah definitely i mean sampling

435
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,838
number one uh cross-contamination is a

436
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,519
big part of it a lot of the money grab

437
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,678
happening in cannabis

438
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,038
the inability to work with universities

439
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,759
because of federal funding so they're

440
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,919
completely afraid of touching cannabis

441
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,838
especially thc cultivars

442
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,400
some of them work with hemp but not many

443
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:33,279
of them they still find it too risky

444
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,038
so having access to those things um

445
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,240
it's a big time problem and i think

446
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,038
that's why

447
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
uh

448
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,798
we have a lot of the problems we do now

449
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,720
is because we don't have proper access

450
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,720
we don't have access and carl i'm

451
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,000
curious with your background and what

452
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,079
you're going to be doing from the

453
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,480
biotech side

454
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,240
how do you go about thinking about okay

455
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,000
so we have the ability to do tissue

456
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,880
culture if we wanted to bring in testing

457
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,240
or or if we're using groups like you

458
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,919
what is it that we can do and what

459
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,919
should we know going into it

460
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,240
as much you previously said i think we

461
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,599
have to adapt all the protocols to

462
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,880
cannabis specifically we can obviously

463
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:19,199
use protocol establishing other crop

464
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,200
species of plant species in order to

465
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,279
to start with but by experience what we

466
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,119
have seen is when you work with cannabis

467
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,558
it's completely different than other

468
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,159
plant species

469
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,000
and

470
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,279
and it's actually very difficult for

471
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,038
several reasons first because the

472
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,000
protocols are not adapted to that plant

473
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,079
and because we have a lack of

474
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,640
characterization of genotypes we are

475
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,038
growing some it's known that some plant

476
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,640
genotypes are very recalcitrant to

477
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,720
tissue culturing

478
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,720
in other crop species we have been able

479
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,720
to find some ways to alleviate this

480
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,558
issue or to just not work with this kind

481
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,279
of genotypes and

482
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,960
introgress traits by breeding

483
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,119
what we would like to do in cannabis

484
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,440
especially using new biotechnologies

485
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,439
like genome editing is ready to work on

486
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,919
a germplasm and improve that one without

487
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,519
having to spend time for breeding

488
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,600
unfortunately we are not yet there the

489
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,359
technique is new and tissue culturing in

490
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,279
cannabis especially making calories and

491
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,839
regenerating

492
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,879
real plans from undifferentiated cells

493
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:19,759
is quite tricky requires a lot of

494
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,520
progress try on errors and

495
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,279
obviously we're all working a little bit

496
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,599
isolated because it's not you know

497
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,599
public domain like in academia

498
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,678
and we will i think we will benefit a

499
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,879
lot by sharing

500
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:36,000
more protocols more data in order to

501
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,720
progress the community as a world

502
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,640
if um if if you were to go about

503
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,360
so we were talking earlier and then one

504
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,480
of the things that as a lab a tissue

505
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,719
culture company we have to be very aware

506
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,558
this is just like uh cloning

507
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
conventional what we do when we're doing

508
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,599
our multiplication it should be and

509
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,200
it should be exactly identical to

510
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,000
the donor plant that we took the cuts

511
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,080
from

512
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,558
but there are considerations that we

513
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:06,158
need to take when it comes to mutations

514
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:08,639
if we don't do our practices correctly

515
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,320
and so one of those factors that we need

516
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,360
to consider are mutations dna variants

517
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,639
and so when it comes to sequencing how

518
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,839
would you go

519
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,480
how how would you go about

520
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,480
um

521
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,839
doing that yourself for your own

522
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,519
genetics or if you were to do this

523
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,558
consulting let's say for a group and

524
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,319
said

525
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,960
you want to know if they're dna

526
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:36,319
off-typing what would you advise that

527
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,319
they learn to ask

528
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,280
can you rephrase your question because

529
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
with a sound i cannot i know i get the

530
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,639
feedback as well it's really hard for me

531
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,440
to understand you guys

532
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
so

533
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,798
so how would you go about doing uh dna

534
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,960
variants testing and what's the

535
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,440
significance why is that important why

536
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,240
should we know about that as an industry

537
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,480
and

538
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,759
what kind of questions could you advise

539
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,159
them to ask

540
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,759
of labs like us related to tissue

541
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,080
culturing specifically tissue culturing

542
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,000
and just dna of types yes yeah so

543
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,519
obviously the tissue culturing is the

544
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,200
capacity for

545
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,200
a genotype to

546
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,840
perform well during tissue culturing is

547
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,200
based on genes either they have genes

548
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,279
that allow cells to grow fast or they

549
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,798
have genes that allow regeneration of a

550
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,639
different kind of tissue from

551
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,158
undifferentiated cells

552
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,840
and we have to characterize the

553
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,880
genotypes in order to know which one

554
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,439
could be

555
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,559
prone to the treatment we

556
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,519
want to do

557
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,839
and

558
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,319
without a massive characterization of a

559
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,678
lot of cultivars it's very difficult

560
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,519
right now to tell you you know what we

561
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,159
are looking for and in fact we have to

562
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,879
identify cultivars that are very very

563
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,280
efficient at this in order to then make

564
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,480
some correlation with the genome and to

565
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,319
identify

566
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,000
potential proteins that are really

567
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,439
helping

568
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,640
any part of the process of tissue

569
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,080
culturing

570
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,919
so we can obviously get some of this

571
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,960
knowledge from other crops or hover

572
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,559
plants

573
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,400
um

574
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,119
but again the lack of characterization

575
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,679
of cannabis genomes is

576
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,959
is very likely a bottleneck right now

577
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,798
that's right obviously we have seen in

578
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,798
previous talks that things are changing

579
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,119
there is much more science

580
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,960
on on cannabis and more

581
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,879
genomic data and i think this will

582
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,840
change over the next years

583
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,600
but

584
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,038
today i mean either you have a genotype

585
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,119
that is very prone and you're happy and

586
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,440
you can do things or you have a genotype

587
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,199
that is very recalcitrant and you cannot

588
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,000
do anything when i was working on

589
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
compass in colorado

590
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,079
basically my

591
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,319
funding source was to grow some local

592
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,720
and germplasms and basically i picked

593
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,519
five varieties from colorado and none of

594
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,360
them

595
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,519
was successful basically

596
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,959
and i know that it's working with other

597
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,879
germplasm so now we have to understand

598
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,079
what's the difference between these

599
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
and uh

600
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,439
to try to

601
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,359
breed

602
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,600
potentially to breed georgian plasma of

603
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,479
interest with that one that will

604
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,519
trigger a good tissue culturing in your

605
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,038
cultivar of interest

606
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,519
right now yes we just need to do more

607
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,679
research and identify what makes a

608
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,960
cultivar amenable to

609
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,200
this kind of

610
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,840
issue culturing and on different aspects

611
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,279
of different culturing require different

612
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,720
genes so

613
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,038
we won't be able i don't think we will

614
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,319
be able to find a genotype that is good

615
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:29,038
for transformation regeneration

616
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,960
for quick propagation or

617
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,558
you know genotype that roots very easily

618
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,159
is also something very important for

619
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,599
micro propagation that's right it might

620
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,080
not be the same jump doesn't than the

621
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,319
one that will regenerate a shoot from a

622
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,079
cell so we have to characterize this

623
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,960
another community we have to

624
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,798
find this and hopefully share data and

625
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,200
then we can

626
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,918
progress as a community hopefully and

627
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,759
then i'm gonna there's three more slides

628
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,000
and then i'd like to open it up but the

629
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,640
before i do those last three slides i

630
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,640
wanted to ask the two of you guys um

631
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,960
when it comes to the day-to-day running

632
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
a lab uh your experience and anything

633
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,480
you want to share with that and when it

634
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,240
comes to training people and the type of

635
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,159
individuals who are best in the hood i

636
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,319
thought maybe the two of you could tag

637
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,360
team that little bit of conversation

638
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,599
yeah sure

639
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,079
yeah the

640
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,839
number one trait i would look for in a

641
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,879
lab technician as their attention to

642
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,798
detail

643
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,480
you can always train them to get faster

644
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,960
you can always teach them how to do

645
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,200
specific movements but if they're

646
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,759
not going to pay attention to the little

647
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,519
tiny details the proper amount of nodes

648
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,679
on your micro cutting

649
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,158
making sure your blade doesn't touch the

650
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,759
vasculature of your meristem excision

651
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,880
making sure you're putting in 100

652
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:46,319
microliters of hormone and not 95.

653
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,440
these little tiny things all add up and

654
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:52,639
when you have 20 30 texts running those

655
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,038
mistakes can compound you need to have

656
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,720
good practices in place to make sure

657
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,038
that you're not getting your cultivars

658
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,038
mixed up that labeling is being done

659
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,599
properly and inventory is properly being

660
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:03,599
managed

661
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,480
yeah but i would say most people can be

662
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,319
trained to be

663
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,240
a good technician

664
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,519
it says can they be a great technician

665
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,278
they need to have that attention to

666
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,960
detail do you think trimmers would make

667
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,200
good technicians i think they would

668
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,919
because they'd have to do the detailed

669
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,440
you know for hours at a time

670
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,759
i've been so far removed from the

671
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,440
general cultivation of cannabis that i

672
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,200
don't know that i think tremors might

673
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,200
make great techniques actually

674
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,278
[Applause]

675
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,159
they take too many breaks i think they

676
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:43,278
might have to train retrain some habits

677
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,200
for that but uh we we've actually tried

678
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,440
that

679
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,919
but what's it like running a lab

680
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,798
um small lab or big lab well what do you

681
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,038
got

682
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,278
um i mean i've been in all kinds of labs

683
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,558
i built small labs extremely small labs

684
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,759
for germplasm uh storage uh and just

685
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,399
cleaning

686
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:05,200
to put into a high throughput just

687
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,440
traditional nursery production system

688
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,440
and i've designed and built out larger

689
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,360
labs

690
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,400
i would say the larger labs a little

691
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,079
more difficult because

692
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,120
trying to create gantt charts and

693
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,558
production

694
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,119
system that

695
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:24,319
works in unison with the cultivators

696
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,399
that are typically less organized

697
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,359
becomes difficult also

698
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,400
a lot of the times market demand affects

699
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:34,399
the larger labs because

700
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,278
the market's always demanding

701
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,919
such quick change of what the users want

702
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,359
keep up on it with tc and being able to

703
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,640
pivot in that way

704
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,639
well that's that's the challenge that's

705
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,278
what i'm so larger lab that's those are

706
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,038
the challenges um keeping up with it uh

707
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,880
you have to be extremely organized and

708
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,278
you have to plan the cultivars that you

709
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,640
want to cultivate or what you're going

710
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,319
to put into the nursery months and

711
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,720
months ahead of time

712
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:01,278
to scale the micro propagation aspect of

713
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,278
it to meet those production deadlines

714
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,440
the smaller labs i find

715
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,519
are a little bit easier to manage

716
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,278
when put into a larger traditional

717
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,599
nursery structure

718
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,558
because those immediate changes or

719
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,079
pivots

720
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,960
are a little bit easier to manage

721
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,119
and

722
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,120
you know

723
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,519
less mistakes happen like i can i can

724
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,519
say that one of the biggest

725
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,759
common problems in traditional nurseries

726
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,679
and in cannabis in general is

727
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,240
um you have

728
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,960
low level labor that is working on the

729
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,919
cuttings and labeling and plugging and a

730
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,159
lot of the times they mislabel

731
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,640
and that happens in the lab and you can

732
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,880
imagine if you mislabel in a lab

733
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,278
and you're on an eight month

734
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,200
production deadline and you've just

735
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,720
scaled thousands of plants that are all

736
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,720
the wrong cultivar

737
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,880
you know so so having that track and

738
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,839
trace is key and having like you said

739
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,200
that attention to detail and um there's

740
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,639
other aspects of a facility if this is

741
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,038
something that you're thinking about

742
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,720
doing for yourself in-house or if you

743
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,038
were to be doing

744
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,000
any kind of due diligence on a tissue

745
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,720
culture company the goal for the type of

746
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,278
facility when you know justin's

747
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:24,319
mentioning small or big

748
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:25,599
it depends on what the intention is

749
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,519
and the purpose and the goal of the

750
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,599
company so when i work with groups on

751
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,440
their designs

752
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,000
do they want to become a nursery and

753
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,880
provide young plants into the

754
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,599
wholesale or the retail markets do they

755
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,840
want to do research and

756
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:44,639
or maybe they want to just do their

757
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,519
in-house production for elite mother

758
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,440
stock

759
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,599
those factors versus being a large

760
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,798
commercial facility when it's you're a

761
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,719
large commercial facility and i've done

762
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,398
several many of actually many of those

763
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,240
designs

764
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,000
one of the things and one of the factors

765
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,720
out of all the minis that i have

766
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,440
designed i can maybe count on one hand

767
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,440
how many of them actually got built

768
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,759
and one of the biggest mistakes that

769
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,399
i've seen when it comes to thinking

770
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,599
about doing this in in in one's own

771
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,359
company

772
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:20,079
is this idea that you can do a lot in a

773
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,558
very small amount of space in a very

774
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,359
short amount of time

775
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,960
and i want to say all of that in theory

776
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,038
is true

777
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,679
but not with the the ideas and the

778
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,440
misconceptions that's in the head so

779
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,440
one of the things that you need is you

780
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,919
do need to maintain and everybody knows

781
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,240
about having you know the cleaner rooms

782
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,720
or a clean room for doing the actual

783
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,880
transfers in a laminar flow hood

784
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,558
we we do need that consideration but

785
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,919
does that need to be together with

786
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,639
everything

787
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,559
or do you need multiple spaces and so

788
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,679
every square footage

789
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,319
matters

790
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,360
to every owner

791
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,158
and

792
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:03,439
tissue culture why you produce a large

793
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,480
number in a very small footprint the

794
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,480
ramp up to get to that large scale

795
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,399
production

796
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,079
if anybody's thinking it's less than six

797
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,558
months or a year you're out of your

798
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,720
minds so i just really if anything if

799
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,359
you take anything home from that it is

800
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,759
an investment not only on the resources

801
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,639
and the financial resources it is an

802
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,558
investment on time every strain that we

803
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,080
work with because we are dealing with

804
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,038
such a

805
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:34,079
our own epidemic of diseases

806
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,839
and age and epigenetic epigenetic

807
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,639
decline it's essentially we have to do a

808
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:40,319
cleanup for every single genetic that we

809
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,840
are working with

810
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,359
even when it comes from seeds right

811
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,359
would you guys agree even when it comes

812
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,519
from seeds you've seen the seed borne

813
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,918
diseases we're starting to see actual

814
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,000
evidence and data that the hoplaton

815
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,080
viroid is transmissible by

816
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,200
by the seed and that makes sense this

817
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,079
embryo came from a infected

818
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,960
mother

819
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:03,359
and so it's important for us to actually

820
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,759
understand some of those nuances and

821
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,678
time and factors the other thing i'm

822
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,200
going to just jump to so we have time a

823
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,960
good amount of time for um oh wait yep

824
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,558
you know interaction with you guys and

825
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,200
your questions

826
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,200
is the type of supplies that we use and

827
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,960
consumables so one of the individuals

828
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,919
who is going to be on the panel is

829
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,919
actually a vendor and and i don't see

830
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,480
enough people talking about what goes

831
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,720
into the labs what type of equipment

832
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,720
supplies consumables we talk a lot about

833
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,399
some of the op-ex but we don't really

834
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,640
spend very much time in the

835
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,398
consideration and the factors when it

836
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,600
comes to things even like our culture

837
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,119
vessels

838
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,599
so our vessels

839
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:46,959
is like a mini room

840
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,639
an actual room with four walls a ceiling

841
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,840
and a floor

842
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,080
so what we use for our vessels matters

843
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,720
as much as the four walls the ceiling

844
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:59,519
and the wall of anyone's grow or retail

845
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,519
space and so that's what this company

846
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,159
does they provide this they also have

847
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,679
micro bags when it comes for

848
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,240
mushrooms

849
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,080
and when it comes to their filters and

850
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,480
we can kind of maybe leave this on here

851
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,918
has anybody used any of their products

852
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,839
before or what's your consideration when

853
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,840
it comes to vessels

854
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,000
gas rate i mean i know ethylene is

855
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,599
terrible for cannabis and then what kind

856
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,839
of equip what kind of a supplies and

857
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,558
equipment when you're doing biotech

858
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,319
laboratory would you consider i mean

859
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,599
right off the bat i am from a business

860
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:35,439
standpoint and a lot of these philoso

861
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,319
facilities that we go to

862
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,240
um

863
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,000
at the end of the day it's about cost

864
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,399
so we have to compare

865
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,720
vessel to labor cost and

866
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,038
there's several several other vessels

867
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,319
out there but this one is extremely

868
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,480
efficient

869
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,918
labor-wise and

870
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,880
you know it breathes really well and

871
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,679
keeps out contamination i've seen things

872
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,760
attack tissue culture labs like thrips

873
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,798
i've seen thrips get inside test tubes

874
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,000
before

875
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,679
people didn't parafilm them and uh but

876
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,640
then you put ferroflume they breathe

877
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,360
less you get hyperhedric plants right

878
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,880
so

879
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,359
these vessels are really good i like

880
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,519
these vessels um they're very efficient

881
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,119
um but they're also costly as well far

882
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,880
away and they're far away and they take

883
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,678
forever to get here and then you know

884
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,278
you have a global closure and makes it

885
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,038
even harder to get them

886
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,519
so you know always have a backup

887
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,679
in-house as well but look at ultimate

888
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,679
goal of the lab and kind of decipher

889
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,600
there what makes sense if you're a

890
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,679
really small lab and you're only

891
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,119
preserving your own germplasm

892
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,278
uh you know you can get away with

893
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,038
magenta boxes and things like that but

894
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,880
depending on the design of the lab and

895
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,038
cleanliness of it you can have higher

896
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,960
contamination issues as well

897
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:49,359
um so there's some people out there that

898
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,200
just buy cheap deli containers

899
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,918
and use micropore tape on the top of

900
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,440
them uh and i've seen that work but also

901
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,600
much higher contamination rates with

902
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,840
that as well it's the labor that goes

903
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,918
into actually doing that but it's still

904
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,839
i mean gosh i i did that back in college

905
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,240
in the early 90s with the band-aid you

906
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,678
just use a hole punch you stick a one of

907
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,358
those small around band-aids and you

908
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,639
have filtration and if you think about

909
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,039
at the bottom of the band-aid when you

910
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,200
open it is sterile right so why not but

911
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,838
it's labor that goes into it

912
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,398
yeah what about you guys

913
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,918
i love micro boxes a ton

914
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,358
they have

915
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,279
saved so many cultivars of mine through

916
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,679
i don't know various

917
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,839
environmental problems for example

918
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,720
the breathability of the filters on the

919
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:36,878
microbox is critical to your success in

920
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,638
canada's tissue culture and that was one

921
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,759
of the biggest things that i had to

922
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,440
unlearn

923
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,200
all of the vessels that i worked with

924
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,039
previously no matter if it was sugar

925
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,960
cane or energy cane or potato or hops

926
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:52,159
none of them had vents they were all

927
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,159
just sealed like ga7 vessels or two

928
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,960
containers or test tubes

929
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,200
cannabis loves ventilation and the micro

930
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
boxes work really really well for it

931
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,879
and it goes through its nutrients in the

932
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,358
containers very fast once it has roots

933
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,440
doesn't it oh yeah once they root they

934
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,119
they just take off and you can get these

935
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,280
micro boxes gamma sterilized from the

936
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,119
factory so you just open up the sleeve

937
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,040
it's like petri dishes you don't have to

938
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,200
autoclave them or anything like that but

939
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,159
they are re-autoclavable should you want

940
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:22,078
to reuse them and be green

941
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,000
the only factor i think about with them

942
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,320
though unfortunately is the

943
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,800
um more concerned environmental side of

944
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,400
me is you know all the plastic

945
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,480
i hope you can find a solution to that

946
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,440
long term plastic

947
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,519
um

948
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,920
i'm working more for at the cellular

949
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,358
level yes i mean use more petroleum we

950
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,519
guess that the need of gas exchange is

951
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,358
not as dramatic as with a real plant

952
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,639
which transpiring

953
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:49,199
but at the cellular level you need a gas

954
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,118
exchange for maintaining don't you yes

955
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,559
we're going in petri dishes so we

956
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,039
usually you know we put a kind of

957
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,519
classic breathable tape just to a low

958
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,039
gas exchange but i have seen in bigger

959
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,280
plans that at the beginning i was

960
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,639
growing in vitro

961
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,079
small seedlings

962
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,279
in a

963
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,440
field

964
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,160
uh cup you know we were using beer cups

965
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,920
actually sterile beer curves it was nice

966
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,920
but it was not breathing at all and i

967
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,000
could see that my plans hyper hydraulic

968
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,800
yeah i didn't like it yeah

969
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,119
yeah so yeah i think the micro box

970
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,480
is a solution the way to go

971
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,880
and um

972
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,199
so i wanted to see if there's any

973
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,440
questions out there before we go on

974
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,639
asking some questions of each other but

975
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
um

976
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,838
be better if we didn't do that if there

977
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,838
are questions out there by you so

978
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,119
anybody got some questions please line

979
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:39,039
up and then we'll just take our

980
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,800
questions in turn

981
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,279
hi hi

982
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,839
um you mentioned preservation of premium

983
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,880
mother stock and it um it made me think

984
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,679
about

985
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,640
scale and where tissue culture is

986
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:55,118
overall in scale so do you see for our

987
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,480
industry tissue culture really being a

988
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,358
you know the

989
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,199
um a replacement for

990
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:04,000
um cloning

991
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:06,159
now or eventually or is it more a

992
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,760
strategy as you talked about to you know

993
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,279
to clean up and preserve

994
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,160
whether it be

995
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,880
dna strains or premium other stock

996
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,879
i'll give my um answer and then pass it

997
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,119
on how about that so that's a really

998
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,760
good question and i don't in the

999
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,440
immediate um and i'm very transparent

1000
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,760
and honest with everybody i speak to

1001
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,320
about this i don't in the immediate see

1002
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,920
tissue culture replacing cloning

1003
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,920
conventional cloning

1004
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,559
until we have automation until there's

1005
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,000
more companies so i'm opening up in

1006
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:41,039
arizona a new lab and one group could

1007
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,880
max me out from what i could do on a

1008
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,320
throughput capacity

1009
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,160
in one day with one order and so i would

1010
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,320
never advise a company

1011
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,639
to go down that route when a company

1012
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,400
like mine will never close but let's say

1013
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,039
it closed right now

1014
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,240
you lost all of your genetics um and so

1015
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,239
i think

1016
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,239
eventually we will get there however

1017
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,879
because it will be more automated

1018
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,919
cheaper faster and

1019
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,838
everybody won't be so worried about in

1020
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,358
the same way and attached to their

1021
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,159
genetics

1022
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:16,960
with more research time money and proof

1023
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,279
of concept on the ground in the fields

1024
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,039
by many many growers

1025
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,040
people will eventually trust the

1026
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,440
genetics that they're buying from the

1027
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,119
nurseries and they will eventually say

1028
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,440
it makes a lot of sense for me to

1029
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,960
convert my square footage instead of

1030
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,240
paying the

1031
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,920
you know the overhead nothing that

1032
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,799
contributes to the bottom line and their

1033
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,358
grows to propagation and to mother's

1034
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,119
space but i see us still years away from

1035
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,960
that

1036
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,039
yeah i mean the market currently is

1037
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,760
still pretty unstable

1038
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:49,679
and the lack of federal legalization is

1039
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,560
going to inhibit the growth of it

1040
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,559
initially i do see long term though in

1041
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,559
my opinion the market's going to kind of

1042
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,000
copy the craft beer market

1043
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,838
where you're going to have budweiser

1044
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
dominating likely 85 percent of the

1045
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,559
market and the consumers and you'll have

1046
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,039
a niche 15 approximately doing the more

1047
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,039
craft aspect of it

1048
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,519
that's not going to happen for a while

1049
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:15,199
but maybe five to 10 years from now when

1050
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:18,239
cannabis is federally legalized i do see

1051
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,358
scale tc labs working phenomenally but

1052
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,679
that's because they're going to be able

1053
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,759
to scale specific cultivars that are in

1054
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,319
high demand and contracted with

1055
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,240
extremely large-scale growers

1056
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,559
so i think it does have a big future but

1057
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,479
only with particular groups and it's

1058
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:33,279
also going to take a lot of money to get

1059
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,400
there

1060
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,920
because you're going to have to invest a

1061
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,240
lot of money in time into building a

1062
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,838
large enough lab and then scaling those

1063
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,919
cultivars to be able to meet that kind

1064
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,078
of scale and demand

1065
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,559
however on a small scale

1066
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,720
it's already here to stay and

1067
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,559
almost every cultivation facility now

1068
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,879
that i see being designed or i'm helping

1069
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,039
design myself we're putting a small lab

1070
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,358
in just to hold germplasm and do

1071
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,679
cleaning so it's definitely going to

1072
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,519
help the craft aspect as well now

1073
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:04,639
scaling that

1074
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:06,480
they typically change cultivars so often

1075
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:08,879
that i recommend sticking with the

1076
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,358
traditional nursery and being able to do

1077
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,280
it that way because it's more efficient

1078
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,239
and at the craft level

1079
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,519
it's definitely a very cutthroat and you

1080
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,959
need to be

1081
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,759
on kind of the cutting edge of what's

1082
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,599
new as far as cultivars and creating

1083
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,680
that demand so

1084
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,720
scaling micropropagation in those

1085
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:30,078
situations is not ideal

1086
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,519
we could take another question unless

1087
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,480
the two of you have anything to offer

1088
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,800
there

1089
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,920
how about how about you

1090
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,640
thanks i was wondering if there's um

1091
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,559
like a best practice emerging i realize

1092
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,598
there's more than one way to skin a cat

1093
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,960
but basically like for growers or

1094
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,280
doing in-house

1095
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,400
or service providers doing this

1096
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,319
is there a typical way

1097
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,400
for example

1098
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,400
you could just to take cuttings and do

1099
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,880
basically micropropagation or you're

1100
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,119
just putting a tube and then rooting it

1101
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,280
or you can then do further steps or you

1102
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,640
separate you know multiply that into

1103
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,079
five or ten

1104
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,799
more and then

1105
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,720
put them in their their own tubes

1106
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,560
is there a typical process now the

1107
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,598
growers are

1108
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,119
sort of

1109
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,000
establishing for that kind of thing or

1110
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,240
is just

1111
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,480
one so you're talking in tissue culture

1112
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,399
or from the conventional um cloning

1113
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,079
aspect

1114
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,800
for the tissue culture

1115
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,800
yes

1116
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,039
so when we're ramping up for production

1117
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,880
there's one mode that we do for

1118
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,880
multiplication and ramping up when we're

1119
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,960
just in the cleanup and for ramping up

1120
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,880
but when we're talking production you

1121
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,760
need to keep a certain percentage

1122
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,838
in-house to meet reoccurring orders so

1123
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,160
let's say you have a vessel

1124
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:49,358
that has 12 explants in it

1125
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:51,279
when we are in that mode we might send

1126
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,799
75

1127
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,920
off for rooting and keep that 25 in

1128
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,519
house

1129
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,200
for in our continued ramp up and so that

1130
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,199
material will be available and

1131
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,838
maintained for us for orders did i

1132
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,838
understand your question correctly

1133
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,599
i think so essentially one cutting ends

1134
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,239
up in one tube and gets rooted it isn't

1135
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,318
then further yeah we need one we need

1136
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,799
one clean one that we have demonstrated

1137
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,960
is not testing positive for any of the

1138
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,039
diseases that we test for in our panel

1139
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,159
and that single x plant then can

1140
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,559
generate

1141
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:27,199
thousands and tens of thousands of

1142
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,880
plants at thereafter

1143
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,639
okay so they do chop it up into a bunch

1144
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,440
of small ones basically yep that's

1145
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:36,879
typical yeah okay so that's that's

1146
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,880
definitely in the pro column

1147
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,838
over here this time

1148
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,640
yeah i have uh two questions so first

1149
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:47,119
question is um are you utilizing any

1150
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:50,400
sort of endophytes to harden plants off

1151
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,880
or re-inoculating plants to

1152
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,280
be able to sustain any kind of uh stress

1153
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,640
factors or anything but second question

1154
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,640
is um

1155
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,118
are you like is there any kind of

1156
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,440
protocol for like turning over mothers

1157
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,519
once you are taking cuttings off of a

1158
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,679
tissue cultured mother that you're

1159
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,159
utilizing that's clean

1160
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,279
who wants that one sorry i cannot hear

1161
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,118
anything so

1162
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,359
yeah the first question i couldn't quite

1163
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,960
understand the second question as far as

1164
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,039
turnover goes with your mother plants

1165
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,400
and tissue culture plants

1166
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:26,000
it's more of a contamination

1167
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,318
question so i often see nurseries become

1168
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,159
contaminated even if they start clean it

1169
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,239
takes three to six months for that to

1170
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,318
happen a lot of growers talk about

1171
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,479
genetic drift i think they

1172
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,599
inappropriately use that term to just

1173
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,599
talk about

1174
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,880
decline of the mother plants

1175
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,599
because they're

1176
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,160
having nutrient issues or have become

1177
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,920
contaminated with pathogen i see

1178
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,719
pseudomonas often systemically

1179
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,760
contaminating the plants so i take an

1180
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:53,919
approach where you just have a

1181
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,079
consistent schedule of replacing the

1182
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,079
moms from culture so that even if it

1183
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,359
does happen you're not really seeing

1184
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,800
those issues down the line because

1185
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:02,719
you're kind of

1186
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,800
making sure it doesn't constantly happen

1187
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:05,838
and then exaggerate through the rest of

1188
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,519
the

1189
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,920
cultivation cycle

1190
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,838
i recommend about every three months i

1191
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,440
see and i think i understood the first

1192
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,920
part of your question and when i'm

1193
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,480
working with my clients on the hardening

1194
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,159
and acclimation on their end

1195
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,480
they're not getting a rooted cutting or

1196
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,480
a rooted plant from me traditionally in

1197
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,519
a plug i'm sending them what we call

1198
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,000
stage threes so those are rooted it's in

1199
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,679
a different shipping media without sugar

1200
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,440
and i teach

1201
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:34,879
you know there's sop and protocols that

1202
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,280
goes with this but you want to think

1203
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,680
about the hardening and acclimation

1204
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,359
process that plant doesn't it's very

1205
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:43,759
easy for these especially in the

1206
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:45,519
propagation team to get this

1207
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,200
even though they have roots

1208
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,838
they don't have the waxy cuticle and

1209
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,879
they're not very

1210
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:52,719
photosynthetically active because

1211
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,160
they've been in a high 100 relative

1212
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:55,439
humidity

1213
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,879
you know since it was a little baby

1214
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,800
explant so

1215
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,800
that process is still a two to three

1216
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,000
week process just like rooting is and

1217
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,079
you go through your hardening and

1218
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,318
acclimation steps in the same way as you

1219
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,720
do a rooted clone only these plants come

1220
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:11,759
with roots and it's really about that

1221
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,358
new first set of leaves the next set

1222
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,400
are the ones that are going to have the

1223
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,598
more

1224
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,519
active stomata to increase that stomata

1225
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,920
and that photosynthetic activity and

1226
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:24,000
then those new sets because

1227
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,440
those ones that actually go in under the

1228
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,519
domes those are not the ones that are

1229
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,599
hardening it's that new growth that

1230
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,400
comes out that's hardening that's why it

1231
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,480
takes two weeks regardless

1232
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,480
i hope that's what your question was no

1233
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,480
it is thank you okay thank you

1234
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,440
um

1235
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,880
obviously the scale up of tissue cloning

1236
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,280
has to do with

1237
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,920
automation as you said

1238
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,280
automation also will come with a bunch

1239
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,480
of data

1240
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,880
and

1241
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,318
that data of course can be

1242
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,838
mined for

1243
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,159
insights

1244
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,639
i'm wondering where you think those

1245
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,078
insights could feed back into the

1246
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,159
growing process i'm thinking

1247
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,800
specifically around

1248
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:11,440
epigenetic decline which

1249
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,599
you know by its name we know it has to

1250
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,400
do with how a plant is

1251
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,960
is is grown and um whether there could

1252
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,800
be at some point uh

1253
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,119
essentially a correlation between what

1254
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,200
you're seeing with epigenetic decline

1255
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,200
and methods of growing

1256
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,719
so that you could essentially be

1257
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,919
feeding back

1258
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:34,159
into a grower's knowledge of how they

1259
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,720
may be

1260
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,759
epigenetically declining their

1261
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:39,759
assets over time

1262
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,639
okay so yes

1263
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,318
so that's a big question and i'm going

1264
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:49,039
to take it in parts if you don't mind a

1265
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,400
little bit because i i think

1266
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,480
first of all

1267
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,639
it requires a lot of research the answer

1268
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,838
is absolutely

1269
00:46:54,639 --> 00:47:00,960
and the data that's necessary basically

1270
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:03,279
we need as an industry not as a group of

1271
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,519
uh in the niche of tissue culture but as

1272
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,400
an industry every

1273
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:10,400
cultivar or chemotype should be sold

1274
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,920
like with those little sticks that you

1275
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,440
get at a nursery that tells you

1276
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,800
approximately the type of light that it

1277
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,599
needs etc

1278
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,920
well until we have the biotechnology

1279
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,599
behind us that has all of the markers

1280
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,920
until we have things

1281
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,280
identified most tissue culture companies

1282
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,440
don't have also uh grows to be able to

1283
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,440
flower out at least i don't

1284
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,920
and then if in those other groups that

1285
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,240
do often times it's with collaborators

1286
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,800
and that's oftentimes also when i get

1287
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,719
called out to consult and i get called

1288
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,640
out to consult in those situations

1289
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:43,759
because these two worlds are not merging

1290
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,199
well

1291
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,599
and there's a problem between

1292
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:54,000
taking a clean plant from the lab and

1293
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:56,640
and then taking a the same ass

1294
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,920
approach that we take to cultivation

1295
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,078
so

1296
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,400
this is a living organism it will never

1297
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,559
be free of everything it will go through

1298
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,358
epigenetic decline we need the data to

1299
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,280
understand the timeline and that and the

1300
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:10,799
stressors that seem to

1301
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,559
lead to that and that's going to take

1302
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,160
years of research by academic

1303
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,680
institutions

1304
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,598
so then you also have these large

1305
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:19,279
companies and i might be getting off on

1306
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,559
a tangent but i hope i'm getting there

1307
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,920
just bear with me

1308
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,079
so then you also have the larger

1309
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,079
companies that are putting in more money

1310
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,359
into r d but that's proprietary

1311
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,839
information

1312
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,199
so there's got to be a way for us and

1313
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:32,000
then i'm going to turn it over to you

1314
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,358
here

1315
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
there's got to be a way for us to

1316
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:39,358
generate the data that you want and that

1317
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,039
you speak to that is necessary because

1318
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:42,558
let's get down to it we're just growing

1319
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:44,558
plants here just tell me the best way to

1320
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,839
grow the plants tell me how often i need

1321
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,559
to replace it

1322
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,838
and then i should be able to have

1323
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,160
high quality

1324
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,400
predictable yields and follow that

1325
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,719
business model but until we have the

1326
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,720
research and development

1327
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:01,519
how could we actually get there and is

1328
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:03,838
there a way to get there faster and

1329
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,759
allison justin is going to talk about it

1330
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:06,880
in the next talk but i also want to turn

1331
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,079
it over to

1332
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,920
matt and

1333
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,680
justin here because they are also trying

1334
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,039
to target this because we need a lot

1335
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,838
more data

1336
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:18,800
matt you want to talk about the

1337
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:20,480
dow oh yeah so i don't know how many

1338
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,680
people here are

1339
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,519
familiar with a dao a d-a-o it stands

1340
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:28,239
for decentralized autonomous

1341
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:31,280
organization and it's just basically a

1342
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:33,679
group of people

1343
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,160
grouping together on crypto rails

1344
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,719
and we have this vision of creating a

1345
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:41,838
dao where people will come together to

1346
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,519
contribute funds to fund open source

1347
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:47,599
cannabis science

1348
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:50,239
like we've discussed multiple times here

1349
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,318
the traditional academic industry

1350
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:55,519
doesn't necessarily mesh well with

1351
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:57,838
cannabis due to federal regulations so

1352
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,759
it's a lot harder to get federal grants

1353
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,318
from big companies or the government for

1354
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,960
example but if we can all come together

1355
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,719
as a group to fund the science that we

1356
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,079
think is important

1357
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,118
i think we can make a lot of good

1358
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,318
headway

1359
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,599
yeah

1360
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:16,639
would you agree

1361
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:19,599
so now with that said is there is a part

1362
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,879
of the question that we didn't get to

1363
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,359
no i um

1364
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,240
of the software that's out there

1365
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,039
do you have any recommendations in terms

1366
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:29,199
of

1367
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,679
a software that's close

1368
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:32,799
in terms of managing tc and also being

1369
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:37,519
able to

1370
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,519
pull data out for enriched insights

1371
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,720
in vitrosoft is one that comes to mind

1372
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:43,519
actually um and

1373
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,118
uh

1374
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,039
there's

1375
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,880
not very many out there because it's

1376
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,838
very different to track

1377
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,160
um

1378
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,599
if you guys know some jump um go ahead

1379
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,199
and throw it out we've got about five

1380
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,720
more minutes and then we need to wrap up

1381
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,078
but invite yourself will be one to come

1382
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,239
to mind before we go on to the next

1383
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,280
question do you have any others

1384
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,159
in vitrosoft is pretty standard

1385
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,200
yep

1386
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,799
thank you yeah thanks for the questions

1387
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:10,159
oh sorry i thought there wasn't another

1388
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,359
question over there i was like we got

1389
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:12,960
another question we only got five

1390
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:14,880
minutes so if there's not any more

1391
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,199
questions then i think we might uh turn

1392
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,720
it over to the next panel to get ready

1393
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,719
do you have any final thoughts you guys

1394
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,199
for a panel that just got thrown

1395
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,639
together so thank you very much and i

1396
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:32,279
appreciate your time thank you

1397
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:32,279
[Applause]
