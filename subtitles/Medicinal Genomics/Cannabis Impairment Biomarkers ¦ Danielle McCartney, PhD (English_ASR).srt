2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:17,219
all right

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,140
and so it all comes back to this idea of

4
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,599
um I guess trying to keep impaired

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,240
drivers off the road and you know and it

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,359
seems that lawmakers or law enforcement

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,939
is really kind of fixated on on finding

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,579
a biomarker to kind of determine

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,980
cannabis impairment sort of like a blood

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,640
alcohol or breathalyzer

11
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:37,259
um

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,960
to your knowledge are there any

13
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,878
biomarkers that are reliable or that

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,160
were that were close on for determining

15
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,599
cannabis impairment or is that still a

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,299
bit of a Holy Grail

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,558
yeah like if you're talking biological

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:55,558
like in some kind of fluid biomarkers uh

19
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,179
at present no we just uh we don't really

20
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,939
have anything that's particularly good

21
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,460
so the most commonly looked at things uh

22
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,018
probably urine blood and oral fluid

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,939
urine

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,140
um is probably the worst of the lot we

25
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:09,359
know that

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,400
um THC and it's metabolize

27
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,260
um things persist in urine for a really

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,659
really long time particularly among

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,219
regular users you know comfortably over

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,740
a month

31
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,478
um blood is is not particularly good

32
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,699
either it can hang around in blood for

33
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,920
extended periods of time and this is

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,900
largely because THC

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
um so it's a lipophilic molecule meaning

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,340
that it likes to get into fat and sort

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,200
of stay there so it accumulates in

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,759
people's fat stores and then just sort

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,579
of slowly leaches into blood meaning

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,799
that it can be there for again weeks and

41
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,739
sometimes longer after use

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,680
all fluid is a tricky Matrix

43
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:49,618
um it sort of has some benefits I guess

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,600
in that it is the Matrix that THC leaves

45
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,599
most rapidly

46
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,459
um so if you take someone who only very

47
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,919
occasionally uses cannabis and a

48
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,899
minister an acute dose you'll probably

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,719
find that it persists in all fluid for a

50
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,000
few hours and then dissipates which is

51
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,078
kind of consistent with impairment but

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,139
there are a number of kind of

53
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,959
significant limitations aside from that

54
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:15,839
um for example the first being that uh

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,598
so the only way that THC can end up in

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,180
oral fluid is if it enters via direct

57
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,219
contact so you have to you know have a

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,319
smoked or you know ingested in some way

59
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,900
that it actually contacts the oral fluid

60
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,818
meaning that if you avoid that contact

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,560
say for example if the THC is

62
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,318
encapsulated

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,659
um You probably won't have any THC in

64
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,939
all fluid um which means it's not a

65
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,199
marker of impairment at all the other

66
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,199
factor is that there's been really

67
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,238
little research research looking at Oral

68
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,780
fluid THC concentrations in regular

69
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,080
cannabis uses and what seems to be the

70
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,000
case is that whether THC is present in

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,800
oral fluid and regular cannabis uses is

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,539
just a it's completely variable

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,760
sometimes it's there 12 hours later

74
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,818
sometimes it's not detected and it's

75
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,679
just a little bit all over the shop so

76
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,479
on the face of it there are some

77
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,099
advantages to that approach but when you

78
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,679
dig a Little Deeper it sort of falls

79
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:12,359
apart really quickly so yeah

80
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,099
um we don't currently have a

81
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,540
particularly good way of identifying

82
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,539
cannabis impaired drivers

83
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:33,399
