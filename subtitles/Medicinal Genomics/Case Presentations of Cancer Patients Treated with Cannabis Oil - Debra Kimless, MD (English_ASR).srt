1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,609
good morning everyone and thank you to

2
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:12,189
the mckernon for providing such an

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:14,160
incredible platform to share amazing

4
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:18,550
information this has been an incredible

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,949
event so far so my name is Deb Kim Ellis

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm an anesthesiologist in pain medicine

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:25,480
specialist I'm also the medical director

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,019
of forward grow which is a medical

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,200
cannabis cultivation company in Maryland

10
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:35,049
we were awarded two stage one license to

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,570
cultivate cannabis in Maryland and we're

12
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:39,969
busy doing our build-out so that we can

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,399
be inspected and create medicine for the

14
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:45,280
patients in Maryland but my passion and

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,219
my love and what I do and I think what I

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,100
live for is that I am currently treating

17
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:53,799
over a hundred patients pro bono

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,810
actually I'm got medical guidance eart

19
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:59,349
with their treating physicians using

20
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:01,960
medical cannabis and when I do this we

21
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,370
define benchmarks we define goals

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,989
because everybody's goals and

23
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:08,408
everybody's benchmarks are different I

24
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,740
take that information and I share it in

25
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:15,299
conferences such as this medical Grand

26
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:18,218
Rounds healthcare professionals patients

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,868
and pretty much anybody that'll listen

28
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:23,108
to me so thank you for listening to me

29
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:27,748
today today we're going to discuss for

30
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:30,309
cancer patients for cancer patients and

31
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:32,498
each of them different but each of them

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,478
have some things that are similar in

33
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:38,228
addition to having cancer

34
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:40,959
the desperate desire for hope is that

35
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:44,649
they were all treated with a very low

36
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,359
dose cannabis oil extract some people

37
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:50,108
call it a micro dose and I'm going to

38
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:52,658
talk about with that definition being so

39
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:55,059
in the circles of in the context of

40
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,560
micro dose in the cannabis industry it

41
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,349
doesn't different than in science

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,498
industry mean 10 to the minus 6 it means

43
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:04,778
a very low dose because medical cannabis

44
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:06,489
I think comes from the recreational or

45
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:09,008
adult you size where people are using

46
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:10,209
very high doses or amounts and so we're

47
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,628
going to do a little bit of math here I

48
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:15,848
apologize so if we take a joint which I

49
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:18,219
hate that term and if it weighs about a

50
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:21,699
gram or a thousand milligrams and 24

51
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:24,879
is THD end up having about 200

52
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:28,089
milligrams in that in that dosage form

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,519
about 30 to 40 percent of it it goes up

54
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,819
in smoke literally and if they consume

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,240
the entire dosage it ends up being about

56
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:39,039
60 to 80 milligrams the low dose or

57
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,820
microdose cannabis that these patients

58
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:45,729
all took was literally less than 1 less

59
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:47,939
than 2 milligrams per ml and we'll go

60
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:50,649
into it a little bit more specifically

61
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,889
so this is their their their their

62
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,319
dosage form in 1 ml half of it is in the

63
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:58,958
tea in the acid form or the raw form

64
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,030
half of it is in the decarboxylated or

65
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,310
neutral form it has a ten to one ratio

66
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:08,830
of of the THC or THC a 2 CBD to CBD a it

67
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:13,240
also has a minor cannabinoids and some

68
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:15,310
terpenes in it as well and they take

69
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,409
varied amount of doses depending upon

70
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,830
what the condition is to treat and

71
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:23,590
there's a rationale behind it legrest at

72
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:27,340
all in 2006 published this chart which

73
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,700
was very nice and it shows the micro

74
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:34,030
moles of THC of all the cannabinoids and

75
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:36,579
it's acid in and neutral forms and what

76
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,769
it does to the IC 50 which is inhibitory

77
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,920
concentration where 50% of the cancer

78
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,840
cells don't grow and what does that mean

79
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,899
in English because I had no idea what a

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,420
micro mole means in life is that if you

81
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,549
use Avogadro's equation and I was absent

82
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:54,879
that day so I actually used the help of

83
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:57,340
a friend to convert micro moles to

84
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,269
milligrams and even at its highest doses

85
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,979
of THC it ends up being twelve point

86
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,260
five milligrams which I think we can all

87
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,939
agree is a lot less than the sixty to

88
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:08,859
eighty milligrams and I think the

89
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:11,799
thought is and what we probably heard

90
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,420
over the last day and a half so far is

91
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,040
that we want to keep the Med in medicine

92
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,680
the minimal effective dose you can

93
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,649
always titrate higher but we want to see

94
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,209
what we can do with the least amount so

95
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,750
we're going to talk about two to two

96
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:27,879
cases of patients with prostate cancer

97
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,978
so the first is a gentleman 72 years old

98
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,050
who came to me with recurrent prostate

99
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:35,250
cancer he was diagnosed in 2000

100
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:39,098
Levin he had a Gleason score of eight

101
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,560
clinical state of t2b and a PSA of seven

102
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:43,509
point two he was successfully treated

103
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,209
with hormone deprivation with lupron

104
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:49,389
injections he'd implant and radiation

105
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:52,029
therapy and his PSA dropped to 0.3 he

106
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:55,079
was doing great for about four years and

107
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:58,418
then his PSA started to rise again and

108
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:02,258
they monitored him over ten months and

109
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:04,718
in August his PSA level was seven point

110
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,939
eight and that's where he came to me end

111
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:09,930
up that his cat-scans thankfully in bone

112
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:12,610
scans were negative for metastases and

113
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,759
he wanted to do some help

114
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,770
get some help so in when he first saw me

115
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,840
he began the first of his three lupron

116
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:22,359
injections his PSA after a month was

117
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,000
still seven point eight we started a

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,509
program of low-dose cannabis well oil 1

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,610
milligram sublingually four times a day

120
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:32,500
we changed his diet and then he

121
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,348
continued this regimen for the second

122
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,478
and third loop ride injection and so I

123
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:40,000
just want to show you a chart that shows

124
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:43,389
on this level is PSA level that was our

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,009
benchmark and this is time in months so

126
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,569
this is his first month after his

127
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:50,139
recurrence where he got a lupron

128
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:53,319
injection alone and his PSA was seven

129
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:56,228
point two or seven point eight I'm sorry

130
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,539
second month alone he came to me we

131
00:05:56,228 --> 00:06:01,089
continued his Lupron and gave him the

132
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:04,120
micro dose of cannabis oil sublingually

133
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:06,399
four times and after that a month we

134
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,759
redrew his PSA and it ended up being

135
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,228
four point eight third months continued

136
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,538
the same regimen with the Lupron

137
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:17,889
and the cannabis oil it dropped to 0.3

138
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:20,860
fourth months no more Lupron they only

139
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:25,060
get it three months in a row stayed

140
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,979
stable fifth month point two and

141
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,810
literally while I was standing in the

142
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:30,639
back getting ready to give this

143
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,189
presentation I just got a text from him

144
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:38,728
he got back from Italy with his wife and

145
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:41,379
his PSA remains consistent at point two

146
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:44,139
81 year-old man who is otherwise healthy

147
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:46,060
was diagnosed with had some back pain

148
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,699
issues workup revealed a metastatic

149
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,490
prostate cancer he was treated with heat

150
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:54,729
implants radiation therapy and the

151
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:57,550
Lupron injections and his markers were

152
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,770
escalating testosterone levels and they

153
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,810
wanted to do surgery to remove his

154
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:05,909
testicles to try to ablate the rising

155
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,910
testosterone that was fueling the cancer

156
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,430
so he came to me with the hope that

157
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:15,069
perhaps he could avoid surgery so here

158
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:20,740
we are testosterone is our is our marker

159
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:23,379
here it was as high as 1350 and over the

160
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:28,300
weeks we started at week zero to week

161
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:31,719
two in two weeks one ml five times a day

162
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,930
sublingually it dropped 500 points from

163
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,490
1350 to 850 his surgeon said that's

164
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,840
great we still think we need to have

165
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:42,460
surgery because give me two more weeks

166
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:44,228
in two weeks used to saw strong level

167
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:46,449
drop below like what would be even seen

168
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:52,689
in a normal level and it continues as

169
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:55,269
such to this day and there are studies

170
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,949
that show that this is not a surprising

171
00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:00,129
result for these prostate cancer

172
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:03,099
patients including a study that shows

173
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:10,800
the androgen reducing effects of

174
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:13,930
cannabinoids so brain cancer to patients

175
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,850
so we have an eight-year-old girl with

176
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,220
acute lymphocytic leukemia

177
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,250
she failed multiple chemotherapy trials

178
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,110
and multiple radiation trials she had a

179
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,199
bone marrow transplant that lasted about

180
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,080
a year and then no longer was successful

181
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,319
and she was placed in hospice and her

182
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:36,579
mom and dad came to us wanting some hope

183
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,229
to see if we can help her out chief

184
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,629
complaints for the little girl's chronic

185
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:45,970
nausea lack of appetite severe headache

186
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:48,220
and lack of energy and upon evaluation

187
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,800
when we saw her she was very somnolent

188
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:54,540
non-communicative and her face was

189
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:57,009
swollen her eyes were swollen and

190
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,509
because she was on Hospice the medicines

191
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:59,980
that she was being treated with was

192
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:07,269
methadone and morphine

193
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:09,670
undivided doses actually so we talked

194
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:11,710
about goals and the goals for her was

195
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:14,589
that we hope that we would reduce her

196
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:18,600
opiates so they can she start eating and

197
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:21,910
actually live out her last days in life

198
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,860
being an active participant in her world

199
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:29,679
and so this is her MRI in February 2015

200
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:35,379
this is a lepton manual spread of her

201
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:36,729
cancer including her ventricles and so

202
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:38,740
improved quality of life

203
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:43,899
trying to help her with their pain and

204
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:46,870
transition off of opiates so it treated

205
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:51,610
her with one ml of the cannabis oil

206
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:53,830
extract four times a day and by the way

207
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,690
this stuff tastes like cannabis it's not

208
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,910
flavored it's not treated it has no

209
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,980
sugar component it tastes awful and this

210
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:02,259
little girl of eight years old sat and

211
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,539
watched her cartoons with this under her

212
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:08,830
tongue without a complaint which I found

213
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:11,319
incredible so the initial response was

214
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,770
that they started to slowly reduce her

215
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,960
narcotics and then replaced it

216
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:19,949
completely until she was off of all of

217
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,420
her opiates she became more active and

218
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,830
she had the appropriate demeanor of an

219
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:26,259
eight-year-old so for any of you who are

220
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:30,900
parents out there you would recognize

221
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:33,789
this as back talking not listening

222
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:38,110
refusing to take a bath and I think I

223
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:40,059
Rowling was involved and the mom the mom

224
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,769
recognized that this was not the normal

225
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:44,169
behavior of an eight-year-old who is

226
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:48,539
dying of cancer and she even though they

227
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:52,199
were on hospice insisted on another MRI

228
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,199
and so there was

229
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,500
and they're still you know some cancer

230
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:03,179
left am an angel sprayed here but you

231
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,879
can see the ventricles are cleared and

232
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:14,669
everything else was cleared this is just

233
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:18,889
a comparison and again this is no

234
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:22,649
surprise there are studies that show a

235
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:25,259
ll and of leukemia is being treated with

236
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:28,409
cannabinoids of all sorts either CBD THC

237
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:31,379
or a conjunction and in fact this last

238
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:33,958
case is a case study sing it out that

239
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:36,750
described a case very similar to the one

240
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,659
I just described who was put in Hospice

241
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,240
was treated with a whole plant extract

242
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:44,069
of cannabinoids sublingually she went

243
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,730
into remission and unfortunately in this

244
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:51,510
particular patient she died of a

245
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,509
perforated bowel but for our case she's

246
00:11:51,509 --> 00:12:02,519
still alive

247
00:11:53,509 --> 00:12:05,429
two years later same dose so history

248
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,649
here's a otherwise healthy 69 year old

249
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:10,289
man who presented to the emergency room

250
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:13,559
postictal he had a grand mal seizure and

251
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:15,899
he woke up in the ER not knowing was

252
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:18,778
going on he had an MRI that revealed a

253
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:23,519
tumor a biopsy diagnosed with a

254
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:27,088
glioblastoma his chief complaints were

255
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,009
lethargy inability to perform his

256
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,899
activities of daily living without

257
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:32,519
assistance and he was a big guy with six

258
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,740
foot four and his wife was it was a

259
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,240
small lady and she was really struggling

260
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,430
trying to just get him dressed in the

261
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,169
morning and and feeding him he had

262
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:42,919
cognitive changes he was a guy that

263
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:44,939
prior to the surgery was active he's

264
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:48,240
insurance salesmen he was on the

265
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:53,819
computer he rode his bike and interacted

266
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,980
with his kids all that changed the only

267
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:59,009
medicine that he was taking was the

268
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:02,879
tegretol for seizures and that was it

269
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:05,250
and that's his tumor and it's in a

270
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,679
really bad area that's basically in the

271
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:11,990
corpus close to him in the center of

272
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:14,120
his head so it was inoperable they did a

273
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,680
biopsy and the one drug that was

274
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,120
supposed to help with glioblastoma is

275
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:21,439
team adore it was tested not to be good

276
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,039
for him so he was supposed to see his

277
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,910
oncologist and gets it up for radiation

278
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:30,469
therapy but somehow he saw me first and

279
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:33,199
we started him on a low-dose cannabis

280
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,389
oil four times a day sublingually now he

281
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,528
complained he hated this stuff and

282
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,720
didn't want to do it but his wife

283
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:39,110
literally wrestled him down and made him

284
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,600
do it

285
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,370
and did the MARY POPPINS a spoonful of

286
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,839
sugar after it was done so he's done he

287
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:50,810
got a mint and he was happy with that I

288
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:52,279
guess until the goals were to improve

289
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,379
the quality of his life improve his

290
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:55,939
function and with the hope because

291
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:57,169
there's lots of stuff out there that

292
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,899
says that it can help with glioblastoma

293
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:04,610
is his wife desperately wanted to reduce

294
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:07,458
the tumor growth and in the first two

295
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,580
days he started feeding himself at the

296
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:12,199
end of the week he was on a computer and

297
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,600
somehow and I didn't order it somebody

298
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,670
ordered an MRI two weeks later and if

299
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,220
anybody knows how difficult it is to get

300
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:21,889
approval for any MRI I have no idea how

301
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,528
this happened but the radiology report

302
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:27,470
said evidence of central cystic

303
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:29,860
degeneration clearly responding to

304
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,860
radiation

305
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:39,778
but there was there was no radiation at

306
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:44,769
all given and here's a side-by-side

307
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:46,990
response now he did go for radiation

308
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:50,740
therapy they did treat him with timid or

309
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,360
even though it was not indicated I guess

310
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,860
they fit and far be it for me to make

311
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,019
these judgments I mean if I had this in

312
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,089
my head - or my loved one I think I

313
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:02,110
would throw everything at them he was

314
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:05,019
treated his last treatment was in

315
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:08,680
September and I'll show you what he

316
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:14,078
looks like now but again there are

317
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:19,299
studies that show that these things work

318
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:23,199
and so this was last week you still have

319
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:25,149
evidence of it but it didn't grow so I'm

320
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,579
not saying that we were curing this I'm

321
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:30,610
saying that we're managing it he's in

322
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:33,639
Florida he just rode a bicycle with his

323
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,789
wife they are celebrating an anniversary

324
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,958
I know they went to some spa I mean

325
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:42,759
they're living a better life quality

326
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:45,969
life than maybe many of us or anyway and

327
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,588
this is our green house that we're

328
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,379
building out it's one acre under glass

329
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:52,660
and I beat the clock so if anybody has

330
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:55,980
questions I'll be more than happy to to

331
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,980
to answer them now

332
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:21,819
funny look yep so it's a proprietary

333
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:23,798
extract of five different strains that

334
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:25,719
they want to combine so they get as many

335
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:28,600
of the terpenes in major and minor

336
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:32,559
cannabinoids it ends up being naturally

337
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,278
a ten to one ratio of the.2 CBD THC aid

338
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,278
PvdA

339
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:50,799
per ml some people get 4 ml today some

340
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,269
people get it depends on what we're

341
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,859
treating and how aggressive and what

342
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:56,110
they look like with their experiences

343
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,600
and we titrate it up I mean if that's

344
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,250
sort of the ultimate goal because I even

345
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,740
though with this ratio you're the

346
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,990
majority people don't feel any psycho

347
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,429
activity I treat patients it was

348
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,929
youngest to 92 and the 92 year old say

349
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:14,230
it just gives them a sense of relaxation

350
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:16,990
helps them sleep but no psycho activity

351
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:19,630
in the - do you know do you know the

352
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,640
terpenoid profile nobody has ever tested

353
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,530
it this stuff is out of California so

354
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,329
I'm lucky that we have this right and

355
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:27,578
then one more question in patients that

356
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:30,700
have had metastatic disease are you

357
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:33,339
seeing any of the metastatic tumors

358
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:38,048
shrinking as well so in the patients

359
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:40,359
with metastatic disease I see them

360
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:42,910
managed meaning that their pain is

361
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:45,849
reduced their tumors have an increased

362
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:49,200
or spread but I have not seen the Mets

363
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:53,439
disappear primary tumors yes but not a

364
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,019
success do you think do you think is

365
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,970
that the reason low dose is so effective

366
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:00,429
is that it mimics the low dose of our

367
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,250
endocannabinoids and it has a doesn't

368
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:06,759
affect our receptor no down-regulation

369
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:10,298
and that it keeps kind of the receptors

370
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:12,190
the way they without changing I mean

371
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:14,440
that's certainly a possibility right if

372
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,929
I had the answer or I would hopefully be

373
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,910
getting a Nobel Prize somehow but I mean

374
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:21,160
there's people here far more smarter

375
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,200
than I am but I think that you know my

376
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,150
thought is maybe it's helping us balance

377
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,279
ourselves allowing our immune system to

378
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,410
do what it's supposed to do I change

379
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,109
everybody's diet to give them the

380
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,690
maximum nutrition to provide a milieu so

381
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:39,099
that the endocannabinoid system can work

382
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,960
is as best as you can a conventional

383
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:43,480
knowledge tells us that the cannabinoid

384
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,880
acids don't cross the blood-brain

385
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:51,519
barrier but though they do cross

386
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:53,409
blood-brain barrier in pediatric

387
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,730
patients they clear-cut that it does

388
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:58,350
because it stops seizures is it is it

389
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:02,460
an indication that again cannabinoid

390
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:05,219
acids are actually you know or should I

391
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,769
say the the cannabinoid acids can

392
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:11,130
essentially be active active and not

393
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:12,298
necessarily the deactivated form and

394
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:16,169
they have to be activated by

395
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:18,269
decarboxylation so I never understood

396
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:23,880
the term activated or deactivated I

397
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:25,558
think cannabinoids and terpenoids tree

398
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,799
of this plant and the healthful benefits

399
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:30,660
that it can offer I think when people

400
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,819
use the terms activated I think it means

401
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,730
to allow it to become psychoactive and

402
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:37,710
so I'm wondering and I'll positive

403
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,630
question to everybody out here you know

404
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,100
is it is that with what everybody's

405
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,870
talking about it's trying to achieve a

406
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:45,928
cycle activity but I still think that

407
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:48,449
the acids provide a helpful benefit to

408
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:57,720
people when I've seen it in over on to

409
00:19:48,450 --> 00:20:01,410
patients yes so that's a really great

410
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,929
question again we follow benchmarks so

411
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,820
for the the patient who's been nine

412
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:08,070
months with a PSA now still back down

413
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,899
2.2 we're going to start to slowly

414
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:12,629
reduce them because I know that his

415
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,900
benchmark is easy to follow for the

416
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,380
eight-year-old girl that is now 10 we're

417
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,630
keeping her on a steady-state dose

418
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,220
because I don't know any better and

419
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,340
right now she seems to be thriving that

420
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,339
way

421
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:34,560
oh no there's these are just the easy

422
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,060
ones I have lung cancer patients ovarian

423
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:41,639
cancer patients breast cancer patients

424
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:45,899
they have if if they follow the plan and

425
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,160
they listen and yes yes just can I ask

426
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,830
one more question have you tried higher

427
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:54,840
dose to see if you can eliminate tumor

428
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:56,639
completely so um I think somebody said

429
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:00,589
if all you'll have is a hammer

430
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:05,850
everything looks like a nail so sadly

431
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:09,059
because we're limited in opportunity for

432
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:10,589
consistency and profiling this is the

433
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,919
only medicine that I have access to

434
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:15,929
consistently and the beauty is I treat

435
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,840
my patients pro bono they get medicine

436
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,730
free of charge as well and so because of

437
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,589
that they're very open to trying it and

438
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,049
if it doesn't work then I do make

439
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:27,179
recommendations to go higher but then

440
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:29,039
our hands are tied as to what it is

441
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,539
because especially in legal states where

442
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,609
they're out west where there's not a lot

443
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,559
of testing it becomes very difficult to

444
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:37,490
figure out what exactly they're getting

445
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,629
and making sure they get it continually

446
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,430
but I would love to and that's why I'm

447
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,860
the medical director in Maryland because

448
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,360
that's my my passion is to make sure we

449
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:47,069
have consistency make sure we have

450
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,289
opportunities to scale up if we need

451
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:51,269
because everybody's different

452
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:54,539
not everybody needs high doses and not

453
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:56,809
everyone works with low dose thank you

454
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,809
everyone
