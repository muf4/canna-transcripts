1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,320
hi everyone my name is jaime brambila

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,480
i'm the co-founder of grace health and

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,759
wellness my other co-founder is my wife

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,000
nicole

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,920
and she is the subject of the case study

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,920
that we're going to be presenting today

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
and my wife nicole is right here

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,198
joining us today

9
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,358
so

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,640
the the title of the case study

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,480
presentation

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
that i'm making is metastatic breast

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,398
cancer and remission following standard

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,079
cancer treatments

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,799
and adjunctive medical cannabis in

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,799
psychedelics

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,439
so in august of 2018 nicole was

18
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,759
diagnosed with stage four de novo

19
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:53,599
metastatic breast cancer

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:57,198
which was an er positive pr negative hr2

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,399
positive broncho-negative

22
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,079
ductal carcinoma

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,239
that it's a

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,000
a mouthful right there

25
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,118
so it included

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,478
metastases of the bone liver and

27
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,359
lymph nodes

28
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,879
when we first spoke to her oncologist

29
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,159
at the clinic at memorial sloan

30
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,039
kettering

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,040
her prognosis was less than favorable

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
they explained that she had to go

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,240
through

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,040
many rounds of chemo radiation

35
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,438
and

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,759
perhaps uh well not perhaps a life

37
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,078
life that would be

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,519
uh filled with uh

39
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,519
therapy for the rest of her life

40
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,239
so here we can see the scans uh the the

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,439
pet ct scans of what she was initially

42
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,959
diagnosed

43
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,000
the

44
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,359
the

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,680
i don't know if you can see my cursor

46
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:53,920
there but

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,920
so if you see the the slide on the left

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,159
hand side that's the initial mass right

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
there that's the breast mass and then on

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,118
the left hand side we see that this is

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,799
these are metastases of the pelvic area

52
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,799
so this is when she was first diagnosed

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,400
she took uh standard therapies in

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,439
combination with the with the cannabis

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,599
and psilocybin and so the chemo and

56
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,719
targeted therapy regimen that she

57
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,719
underwent

58
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,800
was a combination of taxi tear

59
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,039
progenitor and herceptin and in the

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
oncology world they call this

61
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,959
well they they studied this through the

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,680
cleopatra study

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,280
so what we know from that study is that

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,080
37 of patients are alive at eight years

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,719
of age when a patient becomes

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,599
metastatic their life span is

67
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,439
dramatically decreased

68
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,719
you know some statistics show that at

69
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,560
best

70
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,878
in the best case scenario

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,199
patients get to live up to 10 years if

72
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,598
the treatments are successful

73
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,679
it's a life of constantly changing

74
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,598
treatment because

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,519
the cancer becomes resistant to the

76
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,639
therapies and so oncologists have to

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,879
constantly switch the therapies so only

78
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,518
16 of patients

79
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,799
with this diagnosis and with this type

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,200
of protocol

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,200
experience no evidence of disease and

82
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,039
that's very important because patients

83
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,399
that do experience no evidence of

84
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,959
disease that's an indicator of how

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
how prolonged their lifespan can be

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,479
afterwards

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,920
in addition to this

88
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,399
we did do a ketogenic diet because

89
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,199
we had the understanding that

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,158
cannabinoids are lipid molecules and so

91
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,958
if we

92
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,840
optimize the lipid metabolism there's a

93
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,640
better chance of absorption

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,840
we also included supplements borage oil

95
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,798
omega oils all precursors for

96
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,479
endocannabinoids

97
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,000
one thing that i want to point out here

98
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,318
is the pea well let me go back

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,759
so the pea is an important

100
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,518
supplement because that's an

101
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:04,560
endocannabinoid mediator and so

102
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,879
there's there's limited studies on how

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,959
this helps absorb cannabinoids but we

104
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:13,000
believe that it potentiates the effect

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,000
on the absorption rate of cannabinoids

106
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,478
so

107
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,879
obviously we knew um when nicole was

108
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,639
diagnosed that cannabis would hold some

109
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,439
sort of answer for her we didn't know

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,720
what that answer would be

111
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,040
at best

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
we thought that it could help with her

113
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
standard therapies

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,960
because standard therapies have very

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,600
very harsh side effects that regular

116
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,959
pharmaceuticals are not able to control

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,800
so you have

118
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,399
patients that have severe vomiting

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
severe anxiety

120
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,359
severe pain

121
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,918
and the conventional tools that

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,919
oncologists have are not that effective

123
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,719
even though they want to convince us of

124
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,120
that

125
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,919
cbd really offers

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,280
a much better response to mitigate those

127
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,758
side effects so

128
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,439
this was the the protocol that we

129
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,160
figured out for nicole

130
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,759
and if you see this is the

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,960
sorry about that

132
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,280
this is the collective uh result of all

133
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,159
the certificate of analysis that we did

134
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,038
on seven different extracts

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,479
those range from high cbd cultivars to

136
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,038
high thc cultivars some one to one

137
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:27,360
and you know you'll see that she was

138
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,800
taking some pretty heavy doses of thc

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,280
over here

140
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,720
obviously we titrated slowly

141
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,279
to

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
desensitize her to the motor impairing

143
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,758
effects that cannabinoids have and we

144
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,159
can

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,038
thank our mentor dr dustin sulak for

146
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,240
providing that protocol

147
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,199
so we

148
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,879
you know

149
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,960
one thing that i want to point out with

150
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,639
this is that

151
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,799
if patients are seeking to use cannabis

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,120
in their cancer treatments if you see

153
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,879
the amounts that nicole was taking you

154
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
can't just go buy this in at a

155
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,279
dispensary

156
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,800
so in order for us to create these

157
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,559
medicines and make sure that they were

158
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,520
the highest quality

159
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,399
first of all we had to build the lab we

160
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,639
had to

161
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,899
understand how to extract using

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,280
sophisticated

163
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,318
[Music]

164
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,198
methods

165
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,280
to really

166
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,199
extract the right therapeutic compounds

167
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,959
without compromising the acid the

168
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,240
acidity in the compounds

169
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,318
uh and then we had to seek

170
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,319
knowledge from practitioners that have

171
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,919
many years of experience to figure out

172
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,759
how to effectively dose these

173
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,560
formulations

174
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,520
so

175
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,439
very important to take note because

176
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,038
one of the points that i want to make

177
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,399
here today is that

178
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,478
even though we're going to go through

179
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,079
all this beautiful wonderful information

180
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,918
we don't have this available in the

181
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,918
clinics even though we really should

182
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,680
so cannabinoids have

183
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,680
many different mechanisms of action

184
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,478
to turn off a cancer cell

185
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,720
and so the chart that you guys see over

186
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,598
here is just a summary of all these

187
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,680
mechanisms that take place

188
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,519
when cannabinoids

189
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,639
get to the cancer cell

190
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,598
and

191
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,160
exercise that anti-neoplastic effect so

192
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:24,159
we know that cannabinoids are amongst

193
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,479
the most potent adaptogens uh in nature

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,520
uh endocannab so

195
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:32,079
when we take phytocannabinoids

196
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,439
we strengthen our endocannabinoid tone

197
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,359
which produces homeostasis across

198
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,199
all of our physiology

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,280
so these compounds

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,000
have been found in preclinical studies

201
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,679
to work synergistically with

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,160
specifically with her two targeted

203
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,160
therapies

204
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,840
we know that independently cannabinoids

205
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,319
can turn off erbb2 driven

206
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,878
breast cancer cells which are her2

207
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,080
positive breast cancer cells

208
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,800
and then

209
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,038
obviously we know that cannabinoids have

210
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
very very strong palliative effects so

211
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,199
that we can mitigate those side effects

212
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,120
from standard therapies

213
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,478
in addition to this i'm just going to go

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,360
through

215
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,680
some of the main mechanisms of action so

216
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
cannabinoids have been found to inhibit

217
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,879
akt mtor axis

218
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:25,359
this is a very important

219
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,439
crop well this is an important target in

220
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,000
cancer drug development

221
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,240
because it induces apoptosis when it's

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,958
inhibited

223
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,759
so

224
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,838
we

225
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,599
cancer drug developers have been trying

226
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,560
to figure out how to turn off this

227
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,839
pathway and have not been able to do it

228
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,919
effectively without harsh side effects

229
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
because of what it does to help healthy

230
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:51,199
cells

231
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,320
in addition to to turning off uh akita

232
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,160
mtor

233
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,080
uh

234
00:08:54,159 --> 00:09:01,360
so uh cannabinoids also activate mitogen

235
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,040
activated protein kinase uh so map k

236
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:09,039
recep signaling pathways are involved in

237
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:12,719
uh proliferation differentiation

238
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,759
and invasion of cancer

239
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,800
and

240
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,679
also we know that

241
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,519
so

242
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,199
now we have two main targets that

243
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,759
cannabinoids

244
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,839
can effectively bind to and and can turn

245
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,120
off a cancels off through so we also

246
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,080
have uh nuclear factor kappa beta

247
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,759
this is a very important uh

248
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
target in

249
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,519
cancer

250
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,879
development because

251
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,919
this uh this allows the epithelial to

252
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,759
mesenchilial transition oh so for those

253
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,838
that are not familiar with all these uh

254
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,759
terms basically that's

255
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,440
when a cancer cell

256
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,600
becomes from

257
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
turns from an epithelial cell to a cell

258
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,759
that can actually move throughout the

259
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,240
body and can attach so that it becomes

260
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,240
invasive

261
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,279
so

262
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:09,600
cbd provide promotes dna binding of nfkb

263
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,879
nuclear factory kappa

264
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
uh

265
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:18,799
and this has been found in glioblastoma

266
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,879
multiform uh so glioblastoma cells um

267
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,838
glioblastoma cancer stem cells actually

268
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,679
are very very hard to target um

269
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,600
we have some targeted therapies out

270
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,679
there that you know

271
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,680
well i guess i'm not an oncologist to

272
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,479
say that they're effective or not but

273
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,000
the

274
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,480
the success rate with those targeted

275
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,958
therapies is not very high

276
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,759
cannabinoids can effectively uh target

277
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,759
this and can halt the dna transcription

278
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:47,039
of cancer cells

279
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,078
so another another very important

280
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,078
target

281
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,479
are p par receptors and these are

282
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,120
nuclear factor receptors

283
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,000
in particular p part gamma is very

284
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,679
important uh to our metabolism because

285
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,399
that's the factor

286
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,958
that

287
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,078
is in charge of differentiating adipose

288
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,039
tissue

289
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,799
so we know that drug developers are

290
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,278
targeting these

291
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,278
these nuclear receptors because they're

292
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,240
finding out that

293
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,320
if they influence these receptors

294
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,959
cancer cells are being turned off

295
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,640
through different uh different different

296
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,719
targets that create

297
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,519
apoptosis so

298
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,399
when

299
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,200
cannabinoids bind to these receptors

300
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,958
these are these are activated

301
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,000
and they have been found to create

302
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,000
what's called lipoaptosis so there's a

303
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,480
there's a buildup of

304
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,440
lipoproteins inside the cell

305
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,480
which creates the the apoptosis

306
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,040
and cannabinoids are able to stimulate

307
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,039
this as well

308
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,519
so

309
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,639
through through the hallmarks of cancer

310
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,959
we have

311
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,839
cell differentiation and progression

312
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,679
then we have uh

313
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,240
angiogenesis which is when a tumor

314
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,479
becomes uh vascularized so

315
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,159
tumor sends the signal to the brain then

316
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,639
it needs

317
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,319
blood vessels to feed off of

318
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,240
that happens through the

319
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,278
creation of hyph1

320
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
and so

321
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,559
cannabinoids have been found to inhibit

322
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,839
heph1

323
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,359
which prevents

324
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,880
angiogenesis

325
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
and lab studies

326
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,559
and

327
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,120
we have the last hallmark of of cancer

328
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,879
which is metastases once the cancer

329
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,039
becomes invasive and it attaches to

330
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,200
another area of the body it starts to

331
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,919
build another tumor mass

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,639
another very very

333
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,439
important gene target in that process is

334
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,120
called id1 and cannabinoids

335
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,760
have been found to block

336
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,759
id1

337
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:57,199
so in addition to cannabis we also used

338
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,639
psilocybin therapy and initially when we

339
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,759
uh knew uh that south side was going to

340
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,720
work

341
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,799
we didn't know that it had

342
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,560
immunomodulatory properties we were just

343
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,359
using it because we wanted to mitigate

344
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,879
the the depression that a patient goes

345
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
through when they're going through

346
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,039
cancer treatments and when they're

347
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:21,599
diagnosed with the terminally

348
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:23,278
with the terminal cancer diagnosis

349
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,079
so

350
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,600
we

351
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:30,799
selected three types of strains

352
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,800
salicylic galindori simon tampanesis and

353
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,799
golden teacher all of them were grown by

354
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,078
me

355
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,599
so we did a large dose

356
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,879
sessions

357
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,480
and what i did for nicole was i steeped

358
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,799
the mushrooms stems caps and truffles in

359
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,560
boiling water to separate all the

360
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,240
therapeutic compounds from the mushroom

361
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,759
fibers

362
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,680
the setting that we used was in a

363
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,559
safe harmonious environment with dim

364
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,198
lights minimal sound there was a mask to

365
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,799
do a mask a place in our eyes to direct

366
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,679
the the

367
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,439
the experience inward

368
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,599
because that's where we find that the

369
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,000
emotional release happens

370
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,440
uh there was a guide present to make

371
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,198
sure that she was safe throughout the

372
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,680
the session

373
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,359
and then after the day after uh there

374
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,919
was a reintegration

375
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,919
counseling session that takes place and

376
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,000
this is so that the patient can identify

377
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,599
the emotional release that happens uh

378
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,360
during the session

379
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,839
so she was dosed

380
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,399
uh four grams in each session one took

381
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,560
place in november of 2018 the other one

382
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:44,839
in january of 2018 and then she also did

383
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,838
instrument in micro dosing

384
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,198
so

385
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,360
psychedelics tryptamines in particular

386
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:56,159
also offer

387
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
potentially anti-cancer mechanisms of

388
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,639
action

389
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,639
so we know that

390
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,639
psychedelics stimulate

391
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:10,120
5-ht receptors

392
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,240
when 5-ht receptors are activated

393
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,679
5-ht2a in particular which is the

394
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,480
psychedelic receptor these create

395
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:18,319
heterodimerization basically what that

396
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
means is that it's crosstalk between

397
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,399
receptors

398
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,959
when the serotonin receptors activate

399
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,440
it crop it cross talks with uh with the

400
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,799
map k receptors ah

401
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
and it activates

402
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,639
uh it activates a downstream signaling

403
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,839
cascade

404
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,120
which eventually uh inhibits pa three

405
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,120
akt pathways so

406
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,000
also

407
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
they

408
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,639
these compounds influence nuclear factor

409
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,399
kappa beta and if you notice i'm talking

410
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,198
about the same

411
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,159
targets that cannabinoids can influence

412
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,799
so there's a theory that

413
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,319
using both compounds we can potentiate

414
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,278
the effect and that would be something

415
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,759
very important to research

416
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,958
in the clinic

417
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
also

418
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,559
we know that psilocybin inhibits

419
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,160
hyph1 which is that factor that i was

420
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,958
explaining

421
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,958
is crucial in angiogenesis

422
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,160
so what were the results of nicole's

423
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:30,799
treatment so if you see the slides

424
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,879
on the left hand side

425
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,519
you see the initial slides

426
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,639
five months after treatment

427
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,399
only three chemo rounds applied

428
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,959
they found that nicole had no evidence

429
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,958
of disease

430
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,959
and

431
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,440
that was a miracle that we experienced

432
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,599
um we didn't know that this could happen

433
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,759
and we didn't know if the cannabis that

434
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,040
we were using was going to be effective

435
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,560
we didn't know

436
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,519
how the psychedelics were going to

437
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,119
influence her her health

438
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,838
but this is what

439
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,838
we received

440
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,678
so

441
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:14,318
[Music]

442
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,640
how did we how do we prepare these uh

443
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,678
medicines uh so that we can have

444
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,000
pharmaceutical grade cannabis well

445
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,038
it's an intricate process

446
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,359
at the crux of this we have the issue of

447
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:30,400
sustainable reproducibility

448
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,639
the chemotype expression as probably the

449
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
presenters before me explained is very

450
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
hard to achieve

451
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,120
because of the heterogeneity of cannabis

452
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,440
and how it produces that chemotype

453
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,599
expression so

454
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,558
in order to pull this off we need some

455
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,399
sort of

456
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,519
genetic sequencing

457
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,679
to lock that genetic profile we need

458
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:55,119
controlled environment so that the

459
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,798
plants only produce those

460
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,918
chemotypes with

461
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,558
the

462
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,400
environmental setting that that is

463
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,160
controlled to so that it could produce

464
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
that

465
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,038
we

466
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:11,038
had to use a standardized

467
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,599
extraction method so we used uh

468
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,798
cryogenically treated uh ethanol

469
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,918
extractions

470
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,639
and we

471
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,520
prefer that because it's been

472
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
established that it's a it's a reliable

473
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,558
method

474
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,720
so that you can extract the acidic

475
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,720
compounds without compromising them so

476
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,679
we extracted very very low temperatures

477
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,880
negative 60 celsius actually

478
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,600
so

479
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,600
a german pharmacopiac has identified

480
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,759
this method as the method of choice for

481
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,038
cannabis extractions

482
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,400
and

483
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:46,319
handling the acidic compounds um becomes

484
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,960
very critical because they're very very

485
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,439
sensitive so any temperature change

486
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
um you know even throughout mental

487
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,720
metabolization we don't know what

488
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,919
happens to those compounds getting to

489
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,880
the

490
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,600
to the cancer site

491
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,520
to minimize any margin of error we had

492
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,000
to

493
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,079
enlist the the help of very

494
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,599
knowledgeable scientists that are that

495
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,759
were able to

496
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,199
produce mass spectrometry analysis on

497
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,279
our extracts so we know 100 of the

498
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,840
content in our chemotype

499
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,839
expression

500
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,919
so why whole plant uh

501
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,080
and not isolated cannabinoids well

502
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,038
we know that uh

503
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,399
whole plant extracts create um well we

504
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,000
have the theory that it creates the

505
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,080
encharge effect

506
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,119
uh most studies have been done with

507
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:42,079
isolated cannabinoids a

508
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,159
study at a technion

509
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,199
showed that pure chichi did not produce

510
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,480
the same effects as whole plant extracts

511
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,720
we have a paper that came out of

512
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,599
guzman's group in spain

513
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,919
that showed efficacy between

514
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,918
isolated cannabinoids and whole plant

515
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,240
extractions and in particular

516
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,440
whole plant extractions were effective

517
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,279
at turning off luminal beam or er

518
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,960
positive pr

519
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,798
negative hr2

520
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
cancer cells and triple negative which

521
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,639
is triple negative is

522
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,520
still remains the most difficult to

523
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,600
treat

524
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,599
breast cancer

525
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,678
so for patients suffering with these

526
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,918
diagnosis this becomes very critical for

527
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,919
them

528
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,240
so

529
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,158
essentially what we're

530
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,679
advocating for is so that these

531
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,080
compounds become part of the

532
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,080
armamentarium to treat breast cancers

533
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,440
so

534
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,600
what what can we what can we draw from

535
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,120
understanding all this knowledge well we

536
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,879
know that

537
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,319
if this were was to get into the clinics

538
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,960
it would do

539
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,759
a world of good for cancer patients

540
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,600
suffering through this

541
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,640
we know that

542
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,599
late stage oncology treatments are

543
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,840
limited we know that patients create

544
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,359
resistance and oncologists have to

545
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,079
constantly try

546
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:12,558
to change therapies

547
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,960
so we have increased number of people

548
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,720
that understand these statistics and are

549
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,960
opting to

550
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,120
include cannabis and silocybin in their

551
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,519
and their treatment regimens

552
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,839
and recent systematic reviews have

553
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,158
validated that we have tons of

554
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,240
preclinical evidence that cannabinoids

555
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,440
can produce these anti-neoplastic

556
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,599
effects

557
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,720
but yet we don't have

558
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,959
relevant research

559
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,519
we know that there is a lot of real

560
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,319
world evidence out there and we see

561
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,720
physicians and scientists that

562
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,480
understand this effect

563
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,000
trying to get this published into the

564
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,720
literature so that they can show

565
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,558
physicians that this is real medicine

566
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,319
you know we're not pulling the wool over

567
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,038
anybody's eyes

568
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,119
and

569
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,038
if we can just get rid of that stigma

570
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:04,798
that people have with cannabis this

571
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,798
could really be helpful for people

572
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,199
so i want to just give some examples of

573
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,558
the real world evidence that's published

574
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
in the literature

575
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:22,798
uh here we see the first pilot study

576
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,639
that was uh done in in spain

577
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,119
with uh

578
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,080
with patients that had

579
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,959
terminal glioblastoma multiforme

580
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,839
uh we had very very promising data from

581
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,360
that

582
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,918
clinical trial

583
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,079
we see that there are other case studies

584
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,919
that are being published individual case

585
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,639
studies that of patients that are

586
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,679
experiencing this

587
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,679
taking cannabinoids

588
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,440
so we have

589
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,199
small biotechs all over the world that

590
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,038
are trying to figure this out and figure

591
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,960
out how to take these compounds through

592
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,519
the drug approval process here is an

593
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,159
example of a company out of israel

594
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,839
that claims to have produced

595
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,679
a formulation

596
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,480
a cannabis formulation in combination

597
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,519
with mushrooms that is effective at

598
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,519
treating breast cancer

599
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,038
and

600
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,960
where

601
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,720
are we and how do we fit into everything

602
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,840
that i just explained well

603
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,519
you know as i explained before

604
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,558
receiving this

605
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,359
gift

606
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,000
that we regard as a miracle is a

607
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,119
powerful thing to

608
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,599
to absorb

609
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,079
and we can't really help to think that

610
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,000
it was for a very important reason

611
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,839
and that reason is to figure out how to

612
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,819
get this into the clinics how to really

613
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:52,639
deliver this into patients hands

614
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:55,119
[Applause]

615
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,038
and you know i really just want to make

616
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,278
a note of this we really enjoy the

617
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,119
benefits of legalization and that's

618
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,960
great that we have dispensaries in our

619
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,959
locality but

620
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,038
true legalization true access is an

621
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,960
illusion because it's limited by the

622
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,440
budget that people have to buy these

623
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,840
medicines in a dispensary and if you

624
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,919
have walked into a dispensary this has

625
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,959
can become very very expensive very

626
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,520
quickly

627
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,919
the if we were to buy these medications

628
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,519
in the dispensary these medicines

629
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,159
we would be spending about fifteen

630
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,319
thousand dollars every month

631
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,520
which for a regular person how can you

632
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:35,119
ask them to make this expense to save

633
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,119
their life that's it's impossible

634
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,159
so what we've done is we've reached out

635
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,400
to

636
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,320
people that really identify with what

637
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,720
we're trying to do a group of

638
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,079
researchers from imperial college of

639
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,600
london

640
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,720
researchers from the university of

641
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,639
connecticut

642
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,798
and we have put together a clinical

643
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,038
pipeline so that we can test our

644
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,960
proprietary extracts

645
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:02,000
and in vitro models so that we can

646
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,759
screen for efficacy of the anti-cancer

647
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,759
effect that we're seeing in real world

648
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,038
evidence

649
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,599
we are

650
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,798
going to start our pre-clinical studies

651
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,798
sometime in october november

652
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,359
we hope to come back next year to give

653
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,240
you the results of those studies

654
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,240
uh and

655
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,519
so we we

656
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,960
encourage everybody to

657
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:31,599
look into this really

658
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,720
my wife nicole's testimony

659
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,000
that

660
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,440
this medicine is a powerful medicine

661
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and she's just going to come upstage

662
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,000
really quick

663
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:48,620
and just deliver a message for you guys

664
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:52,730
[Applause]

665
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:52,729
[Music]

666

thank you um i'm really bad at this so

667
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,119
please be patient

00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,480
um

669
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,879
what i just wanted to also add uh to

670
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,000
what jaime has been explaining um is the

671
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,278
following

672
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,079
uh before i begin jaime and i want to

673
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,079
thank the many pioneers

674
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:19,119
who began this revolution

675
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:22,839
and who started before i was

676
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:26,000
even a blip on the radar screen

677
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:28,158
um if it weren't for all of you

678
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
uh none of us would be here uh you are

679
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,200
the heroes who fought for this

680
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,278
miraculous plant who saved so many

681
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,720
we're grateful for your advocacy

682
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,558
and are blessed to be a part of the

683
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,839
revolution in medicine that's occurring

684
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:47,440
cannabis saved my life it's that simple

685
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,119
in 2018 when i was diagnosed

686
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,640
when i was told i was probably going to

687
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,119
die

688
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,799
pretty soon

689
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,119
the first thought that entered my mind

690
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,038
was what am i going to tell my mother

691
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,519
that was the first

692
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,720
and then the second was damn i certainly

693
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,400
don't have enough money to buy the

694
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,360
ferrari i wanted

695
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,400
so we're going to have to work on that

696
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,000
um

697
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,679
and uh

698
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,440
i was afraid of everything that was

699
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,759
about to occur

700
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,640
um i was a high school english teacher

701
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,599
and uh i was the one who was telling my

702
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,360
students

703
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,798
you know be careful what you're doing

704
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,558
cannabis is not

705
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,359
maybe the greatest thing especially

706
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,519
since you're not coming to class

707
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,918
and that's because of the stigma which

708
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,960
is the really unfortunate part so this

709
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,360
has been a fantastic lesson

710
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,038
because of the negative connotations

711
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,918
with which i was

712
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,480
indoctrinated regarding cannabis

713
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,880
my knowledge as the benefits were

714
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,880
totally unwarranted

715
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,679
untrue and ridiculous

716
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,320
when my treatment began i was ready and

717
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,720
i had a cannabis arsenal behind me

718
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,480
um and of course a husband who was

719
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,399
willing to sacrifice everything to save

720
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,399
my life and that was pretty cool

721
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,679
i was able to sleep

722
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,320
i was able to eat

723
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,720
and i was able to function even after

724
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,879
eight hour spinal surgery as a result of

725
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,880
the cancer eating away at my four five

726
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,240
and six vertebrae

727
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,080
doctors told me that i wasn't going to

728
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,759
be able to move for probably about three

729
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,480
months after about a month and a half i

730
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,798
was up out working driving without a

731
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,798
problem

732
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,720
and

733
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,720
there are minimal side effects

734
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,480
minimal

735
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,440
and

736
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,120
what's very interesting is

737
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,558
most of the medications as jaime was

738
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,759
explaining

739
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:46,398
are so incredibly debilitating

740
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,558
that the only thing you want to do is

741
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,398
crawl up into a hole

742
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,519
and die

743
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:57,359
and sometimes it's the medications that

744
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,759
make it worse than the actual cancer

745
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,359
and that needs to change

746
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,759
dramatically

747
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,918
because there is absolutely no reason

748
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,079
for suffering at this point with what we

749
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,080
know

750
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:18,158
so my question to all of you all right

751
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,159
how many of you have been affected in

752
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,480
some way by cancer

753
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,919
family members friends

754
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,919
yourselves

755
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,919
okay

756
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,038
how many of you

757
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,720
have been

758
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:36,158
with those people while they're

759
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:40,720
recovering from chemo from radiation

760
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:43,600
from just the depths of hell with what

761
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,159
those medications do

762
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,759
and at this point in time if we have

763
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,320
that knowledge

764
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,879
how dare us

765
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,359
not alleviate that suffering for

766
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,640
everybody else

767
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,519
so for this i don't want this to be in

768
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,919
vain

769
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,720
we want to pay this forward and stop the

770
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,038
suffering and that is what is at the

771
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,399
root and the crux of everything that we

772
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:12,879
do and that's why we're here today

773
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:16,079
so i thank you for your support

774
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,840
and i thank you for the research and for

775
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,079
everything that you're doing

776
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,519
because this this is the change we're

777
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,079
making history

778
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,940
this is where it starts

779
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:35,519
so thank you

780
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:37,519
[Applause]

781
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,598
thank you everybody
