1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,199
good morning

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,798
everybody uh first of all I'd like to

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:15,959
thank kmed for giving me this

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:21,439
opportunity to share with

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,439
you uh my talk on cannabis product

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,198
recalls so first of all I'd like to

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,599
share with you the learning objectives

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,480
you'll learn that product call

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,719
information availability and

10
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,679
quality is

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,558
varied reasons for product recalls have

12
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,479
been

13
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:45,759
numerous and many specific contaminants

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,759
have caused product

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,238
recalls I believe that

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,038
everyone uh knows a lot of this

17
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,759
information but I wanted to go over it

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,600
and this is the Cannabis Testing

19
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:05,959
regulations by state so first

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,439
the states that are have are orange they

21
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,199
have testing rules for both medical and

22
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:13,559
adult

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,118
use and there's one error there uh for

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,478
Alaska that should be orange then you

25
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:21,519
have the green States that's testing

26
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,599
rules for medical use

27
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:27,719
only then there's the green state that

28
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,559
has diagonal Stripes that's Kentucky and

29
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,599
it's not because they don't want to test

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,399
for medical cannabis is because they

31
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:39,158
just passed legislation and they haven't

32
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:41,960
adopted their first set of rules then we

33
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,719
have the the light gray States they have

34
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:47,118
the legal

35
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:50,000
cannabinoid programs in two remaining

36
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:54,040
States Idaho and

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,759
Nebraska um whereby cannabis as adult

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,759
use medical use and canabo programs are

39
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,759
illegal

40
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:08,318
next I wanted to give you an idea we

41
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:11,439
know that 38 states have legalized

42
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:15,799
programs so with that in

43
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:18,280
mind what we did is that we went into

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,239
the Cannabis regulatory sites well first

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,959
of all I'd like to acknowledge that the

46
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:28,480
original source of the recall data set

47
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:32,360
in its version 0.1 was provided by Jamie

48
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,719
to who is presently the director of The

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,080
Institute of

50
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:40,318
cannabis uh science and she she gave

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,400
this to me to

52
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,958
expand and

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,840
so the states depicted in Black in the

54
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,158
regulatory agency website we found

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:57,039
greater I mean some recalls in the

56
00:02:53,158 --> 00:03:00,639
website one or more then the states that

57
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:04,158
are blue with the gray diagonal lines

58
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,639
we have they didn't have any recalls but

59
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,840
we

60
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:13,878
identified um news investigative news

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,080
reports that depicted recalls so you can

62
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:22,079
see examples of New

63
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:25,640
Mexico Missouri Illinois New York and

64
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,599
Maine and I believe there was a total of

65
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:32,839
nine recalls from news articles then we

66
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:37,039
have have the light

67
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,680
blue is no recalls and I'm not going to

68
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,560
make any conclusions in the sense

69
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,319
there's two possibilities one that the

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,719
cultivators processors product

71
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,919
manufacturers have such good practices

72
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:54,120
that they never failed a test

73
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:57,280
or there are recalls but it's not in the

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,920
regulatory website and of course all the

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,878
states depicted in white there's no

76
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:05,119
legalist can AB programs legalized

77
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:10,158
cannabis programs oh by the way I forgot

78
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:13,719
to mention that 20 States out of

79
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,639
the out of the legal states had recalls

80
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,639
in their

81
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,959
websites so I wanted to just take a step

82
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,319
back and talk about the FDA product

83
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,439
recalls that we're all familiar with

84
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,240
what is the purpose of FDA recalls in

85
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,319
the pharmaceutical and Food Industries

86
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,240
and that Safeguard Public Health ensure

87
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:36,319
consumer safety by swiftly

88
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,560
addressing

89
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:43,879
contamination or product mislabeling to

90
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:48,038
ensure consumer safety and drug

91
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:52,399
efficacy so here are some examples of

92
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:55,560
three food and pharmaceutical recalls so

93
00:04:52,399 --> 00:05:00,839
all three of them come from this

94
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:03,959
year and so we have the top

95
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:07,719
it's a food recall and it's some

96
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:10,599
cashews and that it is microbial

97
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,880
contamination then this in in row two

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,120
and three are pharmaceutical products

99
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:20,879
where the first one was a potential lack

100
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:25,759
of sterility assurance and eye

101
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:28,038
ointment and the other one is a oral

102
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,720
suspension that a

103
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:34,360
medication for

104
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,560
let's see it's numus carani which is a

105
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:41,439
lung um a causitive agent for lung

106
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,879
infection uh for individuals that are

107
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,879
imal compromis such as HIV and AIDS or

108
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,680
they take massive amounts of steroids

109
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:54,560
which lower the immune uh

110
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,800
system and that and the contamination

111
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,478
was a bacterium

112
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,400
basilis

113
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:04,000
serus now now the methods that we we did

114
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:07,079
is that we had the source documents of

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,120
all to um of the recalls which

116
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:14,680
encountered at up to I mean 262 recalls

117
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,120
we reviewed each document we extracted

118
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,240
and inputed the additional information

119
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,199
the three examples would be the product

120
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,840
type the reason for the recall and

121
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
specific

122
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,000
contaminants uh or other issues so with

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,199
then we' com performed comparative

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,959
analysis and creative visualization of

125
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,639
the results which now I will show

126
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:44,839
you so we have 262

127
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,598
recalls in the 20 States up to March

128
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:51,159
2024 and there's been a lot of recalls

129
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:53,959
since then in the range of around 25

130
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,039
additional recalls but are not included

131
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,799
in this

132
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,120
analysis so in this pie chart the top

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,439
five states

134
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,280
and with their percentages depicted in

135
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,639
this pie chart is

136
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,679
Colorado Washington Michigan and Oregon

137
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,840
and I must say there's been a lot of

138
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,918
recalls coming out of the

139
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:19,279
DCC in California since our study and

140
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:23,198
then we have the remaining

141
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:27,239
States as shown in the pie

142
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:31,400
chart so then we did an analysis from

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:36,840
2016 to 2023

144
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:38,839
and you can see that in 20 in 21 and 22

145
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:43,079
it's about the same number of recalls

146
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:46,439
and all of a sudden in 23 it more than

147
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:51,279
doubled so I wanted to take a look at

148
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:54,240
what states stepped up so we have the

149
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:57,399
five states Arizona Colorado Michigan

150
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,158
Oregon and Washington stepped up which

151
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:04,359
accounted for greater than 90% of the

152
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:04,360
doubling in the recalls in

153
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:11,918
24 so recall

154
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:14,680
quality as compared to let's say FDA

155
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:17,758
recalls and so here are the examples

156
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,800
like in the movie The good bad and ugly

157
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,400
we have the good that's the state of

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:29,478
Colorado has very

159
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:31,439
detailed recall documents where the s

160
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:34,639
simple types are always

161
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,158
identified in almost all cases the

162
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,158
specific contaminants or other issues

163
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:41,599
are

164
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:45,240
identified and also all the different

165
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,160
products from all the different

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,759
dispensaries are identified in a massive

167
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:55,838
list so we have examples of a pesticide

168
00:08:52,759 --> 00:09:00,000
flour trim concentrate and aused

169
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,600
products with a pesticide contamination

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,799
though actually this

171
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,680
mobinil was the pesticide that was most

172
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:13,199
identified and you and I looked at in

173
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:15,958
terms of possible human repercussions

174
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,720
it's a steroid demethylation inhibitor

175
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:21,439
and I understand that after ignition

176
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,079
cyanide is produced then we have the

177
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,120
flower shake and trim another recall and

178
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:30,559
we have microbial

179
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,000
contamination and one one of the

180
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,958
aspergillis human

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,120
pathogens uh in that state I

182
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:43,599
believe speciation is not required so it

183
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,879
could have been aspil flavis ASP

184
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,040
fumigatus Niger or

185
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:53,320
terius and there are over 20 clinical

186
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,319
case

187
00:09:53,958 --> 00:10:00,719
studies identifying cases of

188
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,879
individuals with cannabis use and

189
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,639
getting aspergillosis or other

190
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:10,240
respiratory ailments so again it's a

191
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,679
third example flower shake and trim we

192
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,120
have metal contamination

193
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:19,319
Mercury uh which is the symptoms our

194
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,320
central nervous

195
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:26,360
system the bad and

196
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:29,039
ugly I didn't so what we have is in many

197
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,320
cases specific contaminant name was not

198
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,679
provided divided

199
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,200
so so in the state of

200
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:41,199
Washington many of the recall notices in

201
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,120
which a pesticide exceeded the action

202
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:49,240
limits the specific

203
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,959
pesticide was not named and in

204
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,079
Michigan whatever contaminate

205
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:57,919
contaminants exceeded the Action level

206
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:01,359
they also were not

207
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,039
identified so so the nomenclature for

208
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,120
recalls in the different 20 in the 20

209
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,399
different states of course is different

210
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:13,360
accordingly to regulatory agency and we

211
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:16,839
did our best the team to see the

212
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,440
commonalities and we bro we whittel it

213
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:26,240
down to 17 reasons for product

214
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:29,839
recalls the and in the Y AIS in the red

215
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,959
I just wanted to you know different iate

216
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,120
between recalls due to contamination

217
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,119
versus other issues but the top two

218
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,120
which accounted for greater than

219
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,278
65% of the

220
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,278
recalls was for pesticide contamination

221
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,278
and microbial

222
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,519
contamination U pesticide

223
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,159
contamination almost 40% and microbial

224
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,399
contamination almost

225
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:03,480
30% some of the recalls had multip

226
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,000
multiple microbials multiple pesticides

227
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,600
or a mixture of pesticides and

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,799
microbials and so forth and so

229
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,759
on oh and let's see going back and keep

230
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,838
your

231
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:21,159
eye uh on the bottom and that's always

232
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,160
not

233
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,278
provided so you can see the reasons for

234
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,599
product recalls they almost all the time

235
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,320
they gave a

236
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,360
reason so then you have the recall by

237
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,879
product

238
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,959
type and so the top two you can see that

239
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,360
plant material over 40% of the recalls

240
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:44,679
multiple products which included plant

241
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,680
material was getting into the range of

242
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,958
25% and almost 10% of the time the

243
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,039
sample type was not

244
00:12:53,958 --> 00:13:00,719
provided so here comes the

245
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:04,240
pesticides there are 20 three pesticides

246
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,639
that were specifically identified in a

247
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,240
recall and I sincerely hope that The

248
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,839
Regulators for each jurisdiction

249
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,839
examines this list and review their own

250
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,800
list as a possible indication that if

251
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,839
it's not included in their list they

252
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,838
might want to include

253
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,120
it and

254
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:30,159
so the top one is the meltin which

255
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,720
counted

256
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:40,399
for over 20% and then you see the others

257
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:44,639
as they decrease and I put in red the 1

258
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,039
2 3 4 AOL compounds and these uh the

259
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,759
medications the primary

260
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:53,919
medications for aspergillosis are AOL

261
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,399
compounds and as a microbiologist there

262
00:13:53,919 --> 00:14:00,078
is a possibility that we're

263
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,278
introducing pesticides

264
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:06,638
into the soil or the solid Matrix in

265
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:10,639
cannabis production that may be causing

266
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,320
the increase in AOL resistant aspila

267
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,839
strains in the

268
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:20,040
environment and then in pesticides there

269
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,120
were a lot of recalls over 30% in which

270
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:25,000
pesticide was not

271
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,039
named so for microbial

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,720
contamination the two

273
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:34,799
winners over 40% is total yeast mold and

274
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,600
the fort Aspirus

275
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:41,278
pathogens with a couple and salmonella

276
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,680
species and I just want to make the

277
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,519
statement as a microbiologist and a vast

278
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,039
majority of the states I believe over

279
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,159
60% of the jurisdictions require total

280
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,159
yeast and mold from action levels that

281
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:57,600
range from 10 to the

282
00:14:53,159 --> 00:15:00,278
three per gram upwards to 10 to the 6th

283
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,000
per gram in

284
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:05,240
that I know there are differing opinions

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,159
out

286
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,198
there does one really get any

287
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:14,399
information as the sample submitter

288
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:16,799
whether the path whether the sample has

289
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,799
any

290
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,560
pathogens and then there weren't that

291
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:29,480
many recalls and metal

292
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:31,239
contamination 16 out of the 262

293
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,120
we see the big

294
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,720
four and there are some states that test

295
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,318
beyond the big

296
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:44,160
four and then there was just one recall

297
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:47,318
with ethanol that exceeded the Action

298
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:50,000
level and one with mot toxins but it

299
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:52,799
wasn't designated whether it was aoxin

300
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,799
or OK

301
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:05,040
toxin so the future dire

302
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,039
s is that there are

303
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,560
eight you know 18 remaining

304
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:13,240
states that there are no recalls and i'

305
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,559
like to

306
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,000
actually look into the possibility of

307
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,399
forming collaboration with the Institute

308
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,159
of cannabis

309
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:26,399
science to make

310
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:29,480
many you know Freedom of Information Act

311
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,240
requests to get recall information from

312
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:37,399
the remaining states where there are no

313
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:40,120
recalls in their agency websites update

314
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:45,480
the data set and repeat the comparative

315
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,000
analysis but ultimately all this data is

316
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,600
to

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,198
advocate for standard

318
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,519
information of all recalls to have a

319
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:57,879
much higher quality of the recalls and

320
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,480
to have transparency in all the

321
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:02,759
jurisdictions

322
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:06,240
so that we can protect the the people

323
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:09,798
and to ensure consumer safety and just

324
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,519
as a quick summary the

325
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:14,599
contaminants they they may pose a health

326
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,798
risk to

327
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,000
Consumers and that the pesticide

328
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:23,240
residues on cannabis

329
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,279
products um have the highest

330
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,759
percentage uh 30 almost 40% of total

331
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:32,720
recalls and the microbial test failures

332
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,798
is 29% of total

333
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,360
recalls and I'd like to acknowledge the

334
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:42,599
individuals that did all the work really

335
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:46,479
uh but we have

336
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:50,558
four uh tasks the data set Source I

337
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:54,880
already mentioned was from Jamie to at

338
00:17:50,558 --> 00:18:00,158
icr uh the data set

339
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:03,360
expansion and um the analysis

340

there is it comprehensive is that a good

350
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,120
model for a state like Texas for example

351
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,400
please welcome

352
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,158
Kevin who's moving we're our state's

353
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,120
moving forward with regulation of

354
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:56,320
cannabis slowly but surely um and so we

355
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,119
want to Institute best practices from

356
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,038
other states is Colorado the best model

357
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,479
for us to look at are there improvements

358
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:05,640
Colorado could make that we may want to

359
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:09,519
consider as well well thank I can say

360
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,080
that definitely Colorado is one of the

361
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,879
best

362
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:17,199
um you know we have a small staff and it

363
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:21,200
would have been really nice to line up a

364
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,360
subset of every state and really dig

365
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,038
in uh but I can say off the top that

366
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:32,079
Colorado is the best and Heather Krug

367
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:34,558
