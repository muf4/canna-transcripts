1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,699
good morning everyone I want to thank

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,070
the organizers for allowing me to speak

3
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:15,019
to you today about something that even a

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,539
few years ago many people would have

5
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,850
thought was impossible and that's taking

6
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:23,900
a cannabis derived product through the

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:27,019
FDA approval process so I'm Alice Meade

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:29,118
I'm an attorney by training I'm with GW

9
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:33,170
Pharmaceuticals and its US subsidiary

10
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:36,049
Greenwich Biosciences so GW was founded

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,850
in 1998 in England by doctors Geoffrey

12
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:42,949
Guy and Brian Whittle hence the GW and

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,410
they had sort of a perfect storm and a

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:49,760
good way of experience that allowed them

15
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:52,879
even to conceptualize and embark on what

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,369
was a pretty audacious project in 1998

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,040
which was to develop a whole range of

18
00:00:55,369 --> 00:01:00,500
prescription medications derived from

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,289
the cannabis plant but developed in

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,829
accordance with modern regulatory

21
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:08,239
standards for pharmaceutical products

22
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:10,640
our first product Sativex

23
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,949
is a whole plant extract actually it's

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,789
derived from two extracts one high in

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:19,070
THC one high in CBD and of the primary

26
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:20,450
cannabinoids it's a one to one ratio of

27
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:22,998
THC to CBD

28
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,249
but we retain the other plant components

29
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:28,099
it's delivered as an aura mucosal spray

30
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:30,318
so absorbed by the mouth and it's now

31
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:32,658
approved in over 25 countries for the

32
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,359
treatment of spasticity in multiple

33
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:38,960
sclerosis not yet approved in the US but

34
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:41,388
we are about to start a u.s. program our

35
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,599
second product is epidural x so it's a

36
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:46,670
purified cannabinoid cannabidiol it's

37
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,608
delivered as an oral liquid 100

38
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:53,240
milligrams MiG's per mil and it was

39
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:56,059
approved as Jonathan said and June 25th

40
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:59,118
this year for the treatment of seizures

41
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,259
and to particularly devastating types of

42
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:05,929
childhood onset epilepsy

43
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:08,060
so you know for years I heard the mantra

44
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,800
quality safety and advocacy that's what

45
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,560
a product has to show to get through the

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,709
FDA approval process but it was until we

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,590
actually did it that I realize what

48
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:22,560
robust

49
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:25,920
mint so if one wants to take a complex

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,680
plant material any plant through the FDA

51
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,409
approval process FDA has given a helpful

52
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,360
guidance to industry and that guidance

53
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,489
gives a little bit of leeway in the

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,370
early stages of development but by the

55
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,650
time you get to late stage research it's

56
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,110
pretty much as strict as for any other

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,780
new prescription medicine and of course

58
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,410
you have to do big randomized

59
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,818
double-blind placebo-controlled trials

60
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:53,068
now a purified product like abba

61
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:53,609
dialects isn't subject to the botanical

62
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,229
guidance

63
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,849
it's just subject to all of the

64
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:01,889
requirements for any new chemical entity

65
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:03,449
now what about quality well this will

66
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:08,279
seem familiar to many of you

67
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:10,500
we have an 11-week cultivation cycle we

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,689
grow our plants in computer controlled

69
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,789
controlled Glass Houses so all aspects

70
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,280
of the cultivation cycle are

71
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:20,098
standardized and controlled we have our

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,189
own natural growth medium that has no

73
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:26,339
heavy metals we don't use pesticides we

74
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:28,620
use bio controls for insects a weak

75
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,848
propagate by clones there's no genetic

76
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:36,629
modification and we grow for epidural x

77
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:38,399
plants that are very high in CBD so they

78
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,289
they're very efficient so we don't

79
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,750
actually need that much in the way of

80
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:45,120
acreage this is a forty five acre glass

81
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,969
house in England that's still a huge

82
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,709
glass house but it'll be sufficient for

83
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:56,159
research and commercialization so the

84
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:58,620
various stages of manufacturing are

85
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,318
rigorous we have to have specifications

86
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,629
all along the way from the botanical raw

87
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:06,539
material through the botanical drug

88
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:08,400
substance that's the sticky extract to

89
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,939
the finished product the botanical drug

90
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,469
product and for a purified cannabinoid

91
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:14,969
specifications for the active

92
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,728
pharmaceutical ingredient or the

93
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:19,560
crystalline CBD and the finished product

94
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:22,860
and those specifications have to be

95
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,709
agreed by FDA and of course we have to

96
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,408
test each batch and accept it or reject

97
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:30,629
it based on the specifications we have

98
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:33,659
multiple in process control

99
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:38,100
we have to validate our analytical

100
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,200
methods to FDA's satisfaction we monitor

101
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,750
from where in sativex we monitor for

102
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,029
more than 13 cannabinoids and we

103
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,699
characterize about seven categories of

104
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,649
other plant components the level of

105
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,060
impurities is established by the

106
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:54,000
International Conference on

107
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,610
harmonization or IC h and fda has

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,740
adopted those guidance documents so if

109
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,470
an impurity so particularly in a

110
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,019
purified product exceeds daily allowance

111
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,880
for under IC h we have to do animal

112
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:10,469
toxicology studies to cover that level

113
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,719
we have to do stability studies these

114
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,270
usually take two to three years to cover

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,460
the expiration date in both the active

116
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:20,189
pharmaceutical ingredient and the

117
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:22,379
finished drug product we of course have

118
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,360
a quality management system and all the

119
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,129
stages of manufacture have to be

120
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,379
conducted under good manufacturing

121
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:31,110
practices for pharmaceutical products

122
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,159
not for dietary supplements that's a lot

123
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,870
of paperwork

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,240
so the batch of 1/b are a BRM would be

125
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,149
botanical raw material was almost a

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,129
hundred and eighty pages long we have to

127
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:46,049
do extractables and leachable studies

128
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:48,269
because cannabinoids tend to stick to

129
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,520
containers they also tend to pull

130
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:55,829
molecules of certain types of containers

131
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:58,109
out all of our manufacturing sites and

132
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:00,539
processes have to be inspected by the

133
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,780
FDA so the FDA doesn't just take our

134
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,240
word for it that we do GMP they come out

135
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,889
and inspect that usually takes five to

136
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,720
seven business days because they're

137
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,060
looking really very carefully at

138
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,340
everything then they go to our clinical

139
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,199
operations site to look the data we've

140
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,269
collected from our clinical trial sites

141
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,219
then they go to a number of the clinical

142
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:23,359
trial sites to make sure that they've

143
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:27,030
been following good clinical practices

144
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,819
then if we do get approval it's not that

145
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,739
easy to make a change so if we want to

146
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,709
make a change to a significant change to

147
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,290
our manufacturing process FDA has to

148
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:39,359
come back and inspect again if we want

149
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:42,000
to change the dosage form so say from a

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,830
liquid to a solid dosage form well we

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,959
have to file a supplemental new drug

152
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:48,538
we have to have chemistry and

153
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,029
manufacturing control data we have to

154
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:54,120
have efficacy and safety data to show

155
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:57,508
that it's bioequivalent same thing if we

156
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,879
want to change it from an oral liquid to

157
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:02,360
a spray bottle we have to file a

158
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:07,110
supplemental new drug application and

159
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:10,020
then there's safety so FDA has a long

160
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,460
list of animal toxicology studies that

161
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,799
we have to conduct and I won't go

162
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,019
through all of them but just the

163
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,389
carcinogenicity studies take about two

164
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:20,639
years and the tricky thing about

165
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,889
toxicology studies is that you have to

166
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,468
be using the same material that is used

167
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:29,728
in your later stage clinical trials or

168
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:32,610
you have to conduct bridging studies we

169
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:34,740
also need human safety data at least a

170
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,250
hundred patient years which can be hard

171
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,560
to get in a short-term clinical trial we

172
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,050
have to collect and compile all of the

173
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,709
side effects from mild to severe weather

174
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,538
or not related to our product we have to

175
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:50,250
do drug drug interaction studies which

176
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,139
is particularly important for CBD

177
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,800
because it interacts with the

178
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,079
superfamily p450 enzymes we have to do

179
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,389
food drug interaction we have to do

180
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,089
studies and subjects that have kidney or

181
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:05,038
liver impairment we have to do a cutey

182
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:08,609
study which is to see whether the

183
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:11,009
product affects the heart and then

184
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,050
there's efficacy so you've heard

185
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:15,658
probably about phase one through three

186
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,418
phase one starting with healthy human

187
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:21,538
subjects and in smaller numbers to get

188
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:23,668
evidence of safety and some dose data

189
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:27,180
all the way through to phase three which

190
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:29,370
are hundreds of patients not subjects to

191
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,800
get the dispositive or pivotal evidence

192
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,019
of safety and efficacy and then after

193
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,870
approval FDA often requires additional

194
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:41,848
studies to get longer-term evidence of

195
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:44,610
safety and efficacy and then what drug

196
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:47,910
delivery system or dosage form should a

197
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:51,419
person use in a clinical trial that's

198
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:52,919
tricky with cannabinoids so as previous

199
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,599
speakers have mentioned you want to keep

200
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,610
the patient in that therapeutic window

201
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,360
where they're getting therapeutic

202
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,329
benefit but

203
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
without undue side effects and the

204
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,599
reason that's kind of tricky is that

205
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,599
with cannabinoids there's a lot of inter

206
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,149
subject variability I think we've heard

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,250
a lot about that in this conference if

208
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,559
if you select a delivery system that

209
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,958
causes a rapid rate of rise in the

210
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:20,789
plasma of THC you may cause CNS effects

211
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,699
central nervous system effects and that

212
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:26,819
can unblind and therefore invalidate

213
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,709
your study cannabinoids don't really

214
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,550
dissolve in water so you need to come up

215
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:34,739
with some vehicle that's appropriate

216
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:37,019
orals products have their own challenges

217
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,089
because that can be a longer and more

218
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,379
unpredictable onset of action and then

219
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,230
it goes through the first pass

220
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:46,559
metabolism in the liver to produce other

221
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:49,879
metabolites cannabinoids are susceptible

222
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:53,759
to degradation from heat and light

223
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:56,278
particularly the acid form usually we

224
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,870
have to decarboxylate from the acid to

225
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,120
the neutral and that can be a step

226
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,940
that's difficult to get exactly the same

227
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,709
every time

228
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,990
cannabinoids aren't very bioavailable so

229
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:09,149
you want to optimize the formulation and

230
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,070
then there's the placebo effect patients

231
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:13,589
who know that the investigational

232
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,500
product is a cannabinoid have a huge

233
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:19,260
level of expectation and that can result

234
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,539
in a very large placebo response and if

235
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,480
the products efficacy doesn't succeed

236
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:27,509
exceed its placebo response by a certain

237
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,459
amount you have a failed study you

238
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:31,588
really by the time you get to face riu

239
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:36,689
get one bite at the Apple so it's really

240
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:38,279
difficult to get it right and then all

241
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,709
of this has to be done under Schedule

242
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,870
one so everyone who handles the product

243
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:45,389
from preclinical through phase three has

244
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,639
to have a special DEA schedule one

245
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:49,708
research license called a registration

246
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,750
and usually a Schedule one research

247
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,599
license from the state and those two

248
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,370
processes don't happen concurrently

249
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,579
usually one goes first and then the

250
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,139
other so it can be quite prolonged and

251
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:03,088
then you really need to be able if you

252
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,490
are a u.s. manufacturer to cultivate a

253
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:06,959
large quantity of exactly the same

254
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,180
cannabis under exactly the same

255
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,099
conditions so you are using the same

256
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,899
material for your phase 3 study

257
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,269
your commercialized product and your

258
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:18,090
toxicology studies and as we've heard

259
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:21,649
DEA has not yet licensed anyone to

260
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:24,649
cultivate a large quantity of cannabis

261
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:27,449
now there is kind of a work around

262
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:30,360
cannabis preparation in finished form

263
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,700
can be imported into the US for clinical

264
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,560
trials and for commercialization because

265
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,770
the Single Convention on narcotic drugs

266
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:40,559
requirement that a national agency have

267
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:43,289
exclusive control of the stocks doesn't

268
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,449
imply apply to for example imported

269
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:49,709
extracts or imported plant material so

270
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,930
sativex and epidemics have both been

271
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:54,269
imported into the u.s. for research and

272
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:56,489
recently University of California San

273
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:59,069
Diego was allowed to import an

274
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:01,289
investigational product from tule ray so

275
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,270
it is possible to do research in the US

276
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:06,990
with cannabis and then because

277
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,120
cannabinoids come from the cannabis

278
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,740
plant and they are active in the central

279
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,289
nervous system there has to be a full

280
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,750
assessment of their abuse potential so

281
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:17,399
people say CBD is not psychoactive but I

282
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,129
believe we were probably the first ones

283
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,039
to do a full battery of abuse liability

284
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:25,259
studies to kind of tease that out we did

285
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,870
multiple receptor binding studies we did

286
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,569
multiple animal abuse liability studies

287
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:33,450
we did a special human abuse liability

288
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,970
study in healthy recreational drug users

289
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:38,250
we did a human dependence and withdrawal

290
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,700
study we collected special side effects

291
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,990
in our clinical trials and then of

292
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,080
course the product would have to be

293
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:48,060
rescheduled so we would take all of the

294
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,610
data from the abuse liability studies

295
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,469
and include it in our new drug

296
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,289
application along with something called

297
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,629
an 8 factor analysis then FDA would look

298
00:12:55,289 --> 00:13:01,379
at all that data and make a scheduling

299
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:05,220
recommendation to DEA and then under a

300
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:06,960
recent federal law DEA has 90 days to

301
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,850
issue something called an interim final

302
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,389
rule scheduling the product and the

303
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:16,050
product can be sold under that IFR but

304
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:19,590
if DEA decides that they're a treaty

305
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:24,209
requires scheduling then it will issue a

306
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:25,019
final rule not an interim final rule so

307
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,600
DEA

308
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:30,779
did so with epidemics it issued a final

309
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,190
rule placing the substance CBD derived

310
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:37,589
from cannabis having not more than 0.1%

311
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:40,410
THC and when incorporated into an

312
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:43,800
fda-approved product into schedule 5 and

313
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:46,469
then you're still not done because it

314
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,269
has to be rescheduled under state law so

315
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,149
the states have their own version of the

316
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:54,059
Controlled Substances Act and under

317
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:56,610
those laws cannabis and its derivatives

318
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,409
like CBD are in schedule 1 this is even

319
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,960
in states that have medical or adult use

320
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:04,169
laws most of them just never rescheduled

321
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,389
cannabis so what that means is even

322
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:08,639
after doing all the hard work of getting

323
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:10,590
it approved by FDA a rescheduled by I

324
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,199
mean approved by FDA and rescheduled by

325
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:16,230
DEA it couldn't be dispensed in any

326
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:20,460
state until there were changes to state

327
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,920
law now those changes have no effect on

328
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,580
existing state laws that allow access

329
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:29,129
for medical or adult use cannabis they

330
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,160
just create a new track for a

331
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:34,320
prescription medication we think it's a

332
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,049
big tent we think there are a lot of

333
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,940
options for patients to choose under the

334
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:40,740
tent but we think it is important for

335
