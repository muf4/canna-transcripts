1
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,079
alrighty I guess I'll just get started

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,718
how's it going canmed thank you so much

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,440
for having me it's great to be here uh

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,759
my name is Sam Hayden and I am a

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,000
research assistant at the University of

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
Connecticut um I work in the burkowitz

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,359
lab where we study the molecular

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,960
genetics of flowering and triome

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,400
development in all of our favorite plant

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,878
Cannabis sativa so I am here to discuss

11
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,558
with you today the mechanisms of short

12
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:40,159
day photoperiodic flowering in

13
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,078
initiation in cannabis and also some of

14
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,599
the implications that these mechanisms

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,280
have on the phenomenon of the incomplete

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,879
dominance of the photo period sensitive

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,039
alil and some of the impacts that that

18
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:57,960
has on phenotype and flowering time so

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,239
without further Ado let's

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,960
begin so first of all I'd like to start

21
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:06,719
off by describing the photo period loai

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,799
so I say loai because there's more than

23
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,840
one Locust that's associated with

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:17,240
flowering time days to maturity so on

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,118
and so forth um so what is a Locus so a

26
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:23,199
Locus is a region of a chromosome in a

27
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:27,200
genome which possesses genes which

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,400
determine a phenotype right and so an Al

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,879
possesses different versions of those

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,759
genes on a homologous chromosome so the

31
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:39,920
photoperiod sensitive alil contains

32
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,759
functional genes which respond to photo

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,079
period and circadian rhythm and these

34
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,519
photop period responsive genes are

35
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:51,158
dominant right so what does it mean to

36
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,438
say that this Gene is dominant well it

37
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,920
means that when the photo period

38
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:59,478
sensitive version of this Gene is in the

39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,079
presence of the photo period insensitive

40
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:04,879
version of this Gene that the photo

41
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,599
period sensitive will dominate the

42
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,679
phenotype and that's due to the

43
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,719
molecular mechanism of the gene product

44
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,318
so we're going to take a look at one of

45
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,239
the genes that's at the photop period

46
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:22,518
Locust and that is

47
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:25,800
prr37 so this Gene was described by Ley

48
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,159
at all and Aurora cannabis and what you

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,760
see at in the top right is actually the

50
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:34,159
ORF of the the open reading frame of the

51
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:38,239
protein and this is the full length

52
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:41,519
protein from start to stop codon right

53
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,560
and so this Gene contains the molecular

54
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,519
mechanisms that are required for the

55
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,878
plant to respond to photo period and due

56
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,840
to the fact that it contains this

57
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,039
molecular mechanism when it's in the

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,519
presence of the recessive

59
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:01,400
Al it will mask the recessive Al's um

60
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,200
phen type and that's because it

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,640
possesses that molecular mechanism so

62
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,839
here we've got our full length Gene of

63
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:13,279
prr37 which we would find the photo

64
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:16,280
period sensitive Al and here we have the

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,878
photop period insensitive alil or

66
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,598
version of this Gene so this is still PR

67
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,878
37 but it contains a splice sight

68
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:28,039
mutation in the gene which results in a

69
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:32,318
truncated protein and so this uh Gene is

70
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:36,318
unable to respond to photo period and is

71
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,919
the recessive alil

72
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,359
so um what we what we end up with in

73
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,759
this case are three different genotypes

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,879
we have our double dominant um uh photo

75
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,759
period sensitive individual at the top

76
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:54,039
there so this contains two copies of the

77
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:56,158
dominant alil and is fully photop period

78
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,639
sensitive which results in a late

79
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,359
flowering phenotype so you can see the

80
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,598
critical day length indicated by the sun

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,040
there so the uh the the full photo

82
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:09,878
period dominant um genotype is not going

83
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,878
to go into flower until late in the

84
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:16,639
season when the days are short around 12

85
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:19,120
hours of uh critical day length right

86
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,918
and so there in the middle we have our

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,240
two recessive alals our double recessive

88
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,879
individual and this individual doesn't

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,759
respond to photo period at all in any

90
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,959
way right but this uh this individual

91
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,160
has an interesting special power that

92
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,399
the uh photo period re that the photo

93
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,639
period sensitive individuals do not have

94
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,839
and that is that these individuals can

95
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,360
actually develop an inflorescence in

96
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,599
response to age alone which is something

97
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,800
that's super fascinating because we we

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,560
frequently talk about what the

99
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,800
autoflowering alil lacks in that it

100
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,959
cannot initiate a responsive photo

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,918
period but we rarely discuss what it's

102
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,319
what it's adding which enables the plant

103
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,198
to actually develop an influ Ence in

104
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,680
response to age alone so keep that in

105
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,199
your mind for the future

106
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,400
discussion so uh at the bottom here what

107
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,919
we have is a bit of a phenomenon so what

108
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,198
what we have down there is the um

109
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,359
heterozygous individual which Poss which

110
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,400
possesses the dominant alil as well as

111
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,080
the recessive alil and now the

112
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,758
fascinating thing that happens when you

113
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,279
have this genotype is that you end up

114
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,680
with an early flowering photo period

115
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:33,839
sensitive plant so the plant is still

116
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,840
responsive to photo period but it tends

117
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,198
to be much more sensitized to photo

118
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,638
period and so the critical day length at

119
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:44,000
which this plant will go into flower or

120
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,000
develop INF fluorescences is much longer

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,360
so we find that um these individuals

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,478
will actually go into flower when the

123
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,120
days are two hours longer than their

124
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,240
full photo period dominant counterparts

125
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,840
and this is a pretty significant finding

126
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,280
for cultivation because what that

127
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,279
indicates is that these will uh develop

128
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,638
infu Essences much earlier in the season

129
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,079
which is critically important when

130
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,598
you're in a region which deals with mold

131
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,359
or mildew or any of these issues that

132
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:15,079
come with the later colder stages of the

133
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,680
season so this is a pretty um

134
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:21,359
interesting um result which which is

135
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,280
very significant for breeders and you

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,199
know developing fast flowering plants

137
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,198
now these right here what we're looking

138
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,759
at are diploids right so they have two

139
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,560
copies of each chromosome and what we're

140
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,080
looking at is chromosome 1 now so this

141
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,399
is the effect that we get when we have a

142
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:40,079
diploid heterozygote but when we have a

143
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,079
triploid

144
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,000
heterozygotic is that when we have a

145
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,800
triploid and we have a heterozygote with

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,160
two copies of this autoflowering alil we

147
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,520
get an extra super duper FL fast

148
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,000
flowering phenotype and what this

149
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,038
indicates is that the genes at the

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,560
recessive

151
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:06,000
um photo period insensitive Al are dose

152
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,240
dependent so what that indicates is

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,800
greater transcription of these genes

154
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,840
results in a uh um a greater expression

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,639
of this fast flowering phenotype so the

156
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,439
dose dependency of this alil was

157
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,759
something super fascinating discovered

158
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,199
by luel and CTS and it's definitely not

159
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,800
an insignificant find in terms of uh

160
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,240
flowering time and we can see that here

161
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,280
in this graph also produced by LEL and

162
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,120
CTS um where at the top we're looking at

163
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,559
our triploid uh dominant photop period

164
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,240
sensitive individuals and they are

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,360
beginning to their terminal flowering at

166
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,840
around 13 hours of daylight whereas the

167
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,158
trip uh Tri uh triploid heterozygous

168
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,359
individuals with two copies of that

169
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:53,158
recessive alil are actually beginning

170
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,158
terminal flowering at closer to 15 hours

171
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,639
which happens much much earlier in the

172
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,639
season and the way that plays out in the

173
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,038
field is that what we're looking at here

174
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,598
you know I suppose if you go out into

175
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,199
the field around mid-september and

176
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,878
you're looking at your crop that you're

177
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,639
going to be much much more pleased to

178
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,879
see plant number two than you will uh

179
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,598
plant number five because that plant

180
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,680
number two has much much more robust

181
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:22,878
flowers um than plant number five at the

182
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,560
same time in the season so this is a

183
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,599
very significant uh phenotypic change

184
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,879
that occurs um and it's also begs the

185
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,158
question of what is going on with this

186
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,479
autoflowering Al that causes it to

187
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,879
sensitize the photo period Al in such a

188
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,240
way so why the heck does that happen

189
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:45,240
this is a question that we set out to

190
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,278
answer and to begin we thought we might

191
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,080
ask well what are the mechanisms that

192
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,838
induce the photo period response also

193
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,360
what are the effect uh mechanisms that

194
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,440
induce the autoflowering response and

195
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,000
how do these two Pathways not only

196
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,480
respond to their environment and to

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
photo period but to to one another how

198
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,720
is the cross talk occurring which

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,879
enables this autoflowering Pathway to

200
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,879
sensitize the photo period pathway so as

201
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,360
with all things in plant biology we

202
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,958
begin to answer these questions by

203
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,360
taking a look at arabidopsis so this is

204
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:21,278
a uh illustration of all the different

205
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,159
flower flowering Pathways that occur in

206
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,240
arabidopsis um but we are focusing on

207
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,639
the photo period pathway down there in

208
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,320
the bottom left so this pathway

209
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:35,600
possesses host of Highly conserved genes

210
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,800
which exist across plant species um

211
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,759
named gigantea constans and ft or

212
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:47,199
fluorogen so these three genes function

213
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,159
in response to uh photo receptors namely

214
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,600
cryptochrome and phytochrome so these

215
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,399
are molecules that exist in the leaf and

216
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,879
when they're radiated by certain

217
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,679
wavelengths of light they become active

218
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,360
and they go into the nucleus and they

219
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,359
begin to activate certain trans

220
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
transcriptional changes there's a whole

221
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,680
host of transcriptional changes

222
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,439
associated with the phytochromes but we

223
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:11,879
in particular are looking at these uh uh

224
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,399
photop periodic flowering genes right so

225
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:17,679
in arabidopsis what happens is that

226
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,480
during long days these uh these photo

227
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,639
receptors entrain circadian rhythm genes

228
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,120
like giganta which is a circadian rhythm

229
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:28,480
Gene as well as constands which is a in

230
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,360
arabidopsis is a central integrator of

231
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,079
different signals

232
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,320
and what happens is that gradually as

233
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,759
the days increase the expression of

234
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,760
constands increases and along with the

235
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:41,720
expression of constans comes an

236
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,120
increased expression of this Gene ft and

237
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,519
that's because constans is a

238
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,799
transcriptional activator of

239
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,759
Ft so this is a pretty wellestablished

240
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:53,000
pathway in arabidopsis but arabidopsis

241
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,679
is a longday plant arabidopsis goes into

242
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,879
flower under long days so it's very

243
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:01,120
different from uh cannabis and other

244
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:04,200
short day plants so the difference in

245
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,360
particular is displayed here so this is

246
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:11,160
a model from Rice um and it may seem

247
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,919
inappropriate to apply a model from rice

248
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,319
to cannabis due to their obvious

249
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,719
unrelatedness um but interestingly we've

250
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,560
actually found a significant number of

251
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,000
sort of homologous mechanisms and

252
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,199
homologous genes um between rice and

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,759
cannabis not the least of which being

254
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,959
this Gene prr37 which we mentioned

255
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,360
before which possesses this molecular

256
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,958
mechanism which responds to photo

257
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,720
period and due to the fact that it

258
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,199
responds to photo period it's it's

259
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,240
critically daylength gated right and

260
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,200
what that indicates is that it has a

261
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,278
basic function right so it has one

262
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,720
discrete function during long days and a

263
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:54,639
completely separate discrete function

264
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,560
during short days similarly so does

265
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,959
constants and um we've been able to see

266
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,679
that this uh sort of pattern is present

267
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:05,399
in both rice and cannabis so I would say

268
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,799
that it's not entirely unreasonable to

269
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,879
suggest that this uh mechanism is likely

270
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:13,039
conserved between rice and cannabis so

271
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,679
we're proceeding forward using this

272
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,559
model as the most likely way for uh

273
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,759
short day photop periodic flowering

274
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:22,919
initiation in cannabis and the way that

275
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:25,600
this works is that there are one or more

276
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,799
genes expressed in the leaf whose

277
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,959
protein products actually directly

278
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:33,399
interact with the const Gene and that

279
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,838
prevents constans from its performing

280
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,320
its function of upregulating Ft so

281
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,040
that's how things are working during

282
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,000
long days during short days these

283
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,559
circadian rhythm genes are affected and

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,799
the expression patterns of these

285
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,679
repressors fail and what happens is

286
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,240
they're they release their repression of

287
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:56,359
constants allowing constants to go ahead

288
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:00,000
and upregulate ft and this is a

289
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:03,000
critically daylength gated basic

290
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,799
function um so as a result we thought

291
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,839
that it would be wise to start trying to

292
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,799
identify critically day length gated

293
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,760
genes or genes which have significant

294
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,519
expression changes based on Photo period

295
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,879
and then secondarily of course we want

296
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,759
to see whether or not these critically

297
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,439
daylength gated genes are interacting

298
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:28,399
with constands directly in any way to

299
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,639
repress or initiate flowering so that is

300
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,120
this is more or less the model we've

301
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,759
been working on and the model that we're

302
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,360
continuing to study and to

303
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,278
test

304
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,480
so here's a little illustration of how

305
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,720
that model of this putative model and

306
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,839
how it is likely to work in the cannabis

307
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,000
plant so here we have our happy plant

308
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:53,600
vegetative long days we have constans

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,879
which exists in the leaf and it is being

310
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,639
repressed by these interactors due to

311
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,600
the fact that we are under long day

312
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,759
conditions so everything's hanging out

313
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,560
just being very vegetative not very

314
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,199
exciting but then upon the transition

315
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,719
into short days uh what we find is that

316
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:13,359
these cryptochromes and phytochromes are

317
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,480
entraining these circadian rhythm genes

318
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,759
which are also entraining the uh

319
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,320
constans Gene and the result is the

320
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,560
failure of the expression patterns of

321
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,360
these repressors and when these

322
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:28,278
repressors fail they allow Constance to

323
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,879
go forth and perform its function of

324
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:33,799
upregulated

325
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:36,639
ft ft flogen is expressed in the leaf

326
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:39,278
where it translocates up to the marem

327
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,959
and activates floral meristem identity

328
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:45,799
genes like s so1 and leafy which result

329
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:50,039
in beautiful triom Laden flowers that we

330
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:53,679
love so much so this here is sort of the

331
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:55,439
putative model of what's going on in the

332
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:59,078
cannabis plant with regards to photop

333
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,519
periodic flowering initiation and so the

334
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:04,599
photop period genes at the insensitive

335
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:08,159
Al the autoflowering AL do not elicit a

336
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:11,680
response so they don't do this part um

337
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:14,039
they fail to respond to photo period to

338
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,239
uh modulate the uh the activity of

339
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:20,159
constants and their for Ft so they're

340
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,680
not doing that right but now here's the

341
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,000
question that I'd like to pose for all

342
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,919
of you because I don't really see

343
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,519
anybody asking this question um how is

344
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:31,519
it that the insensitive Al is uh causing

345
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,039
this phenomenon of incomplete dominance

346
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,039
how is it that the insensitive Al is

347
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,799
actually modulating the photop period

348
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:41,519
response and widening the critical day

349
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,799
length in heterozygotes resulting in a

350
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,679
fast flowering phenotype I think that's

351
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,838
a question worth asking I don't have

352
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,638
answers yet but we're working on it so

353
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,639
uh probably one thing to remind

354
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,560
everybody in the room about before we

355
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,480
continue discussing the subject is that

356
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,559
um cannabis actually does produce

357
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,920
solitary flowers during the mature

358
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:05,919
vegetative phase right so it doesn't

359
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,000
actually require short days to to flower

360
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,599
all cannabis genotypes upon entering the

361
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,198
mature vegetative phase produce uh

362
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,560
single solitary flowers but they don't

363
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,120
produce inflorescences so what we're

364
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:20,359
really talking about when we say short

365
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,318
day flowering is the development of the

366
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,519
infloresence and um short uh photo

367
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:28,599
period sensitive plants simply will not

368
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,560
produce an inflorescence unless you

369
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,600
expose exp them to short days it's it's

370
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,439
it's impossible for them to develop an

371
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,480
an infloresence based on age alone

372
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,480
however in our autoflowering individuals

373
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,639
we see that they obviously have that

374
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,839
capacity they they can grow to a certain

375
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,959
age and then develop an inflorescence so

376
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,160
we we constantly talk about what these

377
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,838
autoflowering alals are lacking in terms

378
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,318
of their ability to respond to photo

379
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,319
period but we rarely discuss the

380
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:58,679
additive function that's coming from the

381
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:00,759
autoflowering alals and I think that

382
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:04,038
that's a really ripe subject of study to

383
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,679
be looking into um so again it's also

384
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:09,160
interest it's worthwhile to remember

385
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,038
that only one uh autoflowering Locust

386
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,600
has been well characterized but there

387
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:17,558
are at least uh three other loai in the

388
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:20,838
Cannabis genome uh which were described

389
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:24,759
and and uh labeled DTM 1 uh sorry 2

390
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:26,519
three and four by Steel at uh steel at

391
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:29,599
all at Latrobe

392
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:32,960
University and uh dtm2 which is on

393
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,199
chromosome 2 contains a host of SPL

394
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,640
genes which is a family of genes which

395
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,840
encode transcription factors which you

396
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,320
know activate transcription and these

397
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,759
genes tend to activate S so1 which as we

398
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,519
learned before is our floral meristem

399
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,960
identity Gene it's a master

400
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,480
transcriptional regulator so effectively

401
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,079
what we're seeing is another Pathway to

402
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,480
flowering which is of course expressed

403
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:03,359
in all cannabis genotypes but only seems

404
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,159
to lead to age um age dependent

405
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,279
development of inflorescences in

406
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,720
autoflowering plants so I do believe

407
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,200
that this would be an interesting place

408
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,759
to look to try and understand what's

409
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,400
going on with this phenomenon of

410
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,960
incomplete

411
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,679
dominance so in the event that you're a

412
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,640
bioinformatician and you want to take a

413
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,200
look at what genes are at these lowai

414
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,759
here you have it um this is a little map

415
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,279
of the chromosomal locations of DTM 1 2

416
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,440
3 and four uh where two three and four

417
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,440
are largely

418
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,360
uncharacterized and here would be sort

419
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:42,158
of like a graphical illustration of what

420
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,319
might be happening in these uh fast

421
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,880
flowering incompletely dominant

422
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,359
individuals right so on the right side

423
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,799
here you're seeing um you're seeing the

424
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:55,678
photo period pathway what you're seeing

425
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:57,759
is the reaction of these repressors of

426
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,759
constants to the entrainment of

427
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:04,000
circadian rhythm during short days

428
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,839
activation of constands activation of Ft

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,359
floral meristem identity but then over

430
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,480
there on the left you're seeing a less

431
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,439
talked about about pathway and this is

432
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,640
the pathway that induces solitary

433
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,200
flowers in vegetative plants but it is

434
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,120
also more than likely maybe some some uh

435
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,759
some some minor differences in these

436
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:25,319
genes are actually contributing to the

437
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,640
modulation of the photo period pathway

438
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,519
so what we're proposing here is that

439
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,400
this age dependent path pathway which

440
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,639
depends on the expression of a couple of

441
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,038
micro rnas which regulate spls which

442
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,600
regulate s

443
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,079
so1 that this pathway in the

444
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,879
autoflowering individuals might actually

445
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,599
be having an effect on the photop

446
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,840
Periodic response modulating it and

447
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:53,158
sensitizing it which makes it um result

448
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,678
in this fast flowering

449
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:59,360
phenotype so this is sort of the best

450
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,320
model we have to work with at the time

451
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,119
but a good question also is how did we

452
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,759
get here where did this begin because

453
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,439
I'll tell you we didn't start by looking

454
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,440
into incomplete dominance of the

455
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,080
autoflowering alil um if you remember my

456
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,960
talk from last year what we discussed

457
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:20,240
was uh the use of spectal diet to try

458
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:23,558
and um modulate uh gene expression and

459
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,120
also um biomass accumulation and

460
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:27,038
cannabinoid accumulation we were trying

461
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,759
to see if we could modulate red far red

462
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,400
ratios and therefore fect phytochrome

463
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,440
the photo receptor I

464
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,120
discussed which would affect gene

465
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,080
expression and induce changes in the

466
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:43,479
phenotype um disappointingly we were not

467
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,879
able to affect a change in biomass or

468
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,599
yield or any other sort of

469
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,360
phenotypic um measurements that we took

470
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:56,000
however we did find that we were able to

471
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:58,678
uh affect the expression of genes in the

472
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,279
uh photoperiodic flowering pathway which

473
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,400
indicates of course that they are

474
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:06,798
responsive to phytochrome and uh in

475
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,559
addition we uh we we basically found

476
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:13,359
that we were able to use this sample set

477
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:15,798
to create a transcriptional map of the

478
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,719
changes that occur in the photoperiodic

479
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:21,038
flowering genes which results in photop

480
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,360
periodic flowering because we had

481
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:27,000
samples from the leaf from pre- short

482
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:29,158
days as well as uh four different time

483
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,319
points after short days

484
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:36,320
and we also have the marem tissue from

485
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:38,879
the end of week one and week two so in

486
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,678
doing this we were able to sort of yeah

487
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,799
map the transcriptional changes that

488
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,080
occur in the leaf which result in

489
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,119
signals to the marem which result in

490
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,678
further transcriptional

491
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,558
changes and interestingly we did start

492
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,159
to see some strange results almost

493
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:54,960
nothing makes sense but that's a lot of

494
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,278
fun as a scientist you know things don't

495
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,720
make sense we want to find out why and

496
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,519
one of the first things that don't make

497
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,240
sense is that the we were able to

498
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,319
increase the expression of constants

499
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,159
significantly using by modulating

500
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:12,079
phytochrome activity and but the strange

501
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,120
finding is that this increased

502
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,599
expression of constants was correlated

503
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:20,678
with a decreased expression in Ft this

504
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:22,719
floral activator and knowing that um the

505
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,120
constant Gene is supposed to be a

506
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,720
transcriptional activator of Ft it

507
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,399
really doesn't make any sense that its

508
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,880
increased expression would be correlated

509
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,480
with with a decreased expression of Ft

510
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,480
so that's the first strange finding uh

511
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,000
followed up by two expected findings

512
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,240
which were good um we found that prr37

513
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,839
expression decreased significantly upon

514
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,159
the entry into short days and that makes

515
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:50,480
sense because prr37 is putatively a

516
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,159
repressor of that floral meristem

517
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,440
activator Gene

518
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,240
ft which would of course be degraded

519
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,240
upon the entry into short days after

520
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,400
which

521
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,839
um the con it allows constants to go

522
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,798
ahead and activate ft so this further

523
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:10,798
confirms the function of

524
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:13,519
prr37 as a basic regulator which also

525
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:17,240
sort of lends to the notion that this

526
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,879
rice model Could Be an Effective one for

527
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,640
cannabis um and then of course we see s

528
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,799
so1 our floral meristem uh identity Gene

529
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,559
which is significantly upregulated by

530
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:34,599
day 14 following the activation by FL

531
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:37,519
so having found these uh results using

532
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:39,480
qpcr we decided to go ahead and take it

533
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,679
further and try to identify some more

534
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,038
critically daylength gated genes by uh

535
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,080
using

536
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:50,278
bioinformatics but prior to that we did

537
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,759
some more qpcr on the constant Gene

538
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:56,440
which of course we've been discussing at

539
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:58,480
length now the constants Gene uh in rice

540
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,278
the expression of it doesn't change it's

541
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,599
its activity is more or less determined

542
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:05,000
by the presence of these interactors

543
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,678
right so uh it's been shown that

544
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,839
constant's expression in rice doesn't

545
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,600
change very much in arabidopsis Conan's

546
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,158
expression during the flowering period

547
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,439
tends to increase right during long days

548
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,000
conand increases it increases the

549
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,159
expression of ft and leads to this

550
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,839
gradual development of

551
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,799
flowers so uh there are 13 different

552
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:27,359
constand Gene in the Cannabis genome and

553
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,359
we identified the ones that were most

554
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:33,240
highly expressed in our wife cultivar

555
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:35,519
and um we uh we studied the ones that

556
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,278
were most highly expressed and we found

557
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,319
that the majority of the constant genes

558
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,640
were actually downregulated upon the

559
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:44,519
entry into short days which given that

560
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,200
it is generally acting as a activator of

561
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,359
flowering this uh doesn't line up it's a

562
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,720
little strange one of the genes

563
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,639
constands number nine did not change and

564
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,919
we were able to find that only one of

565
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,559
the constand genes constands number five

566
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,720
seemed be significantly responsive to

567
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:06,000
phytochrome and that's also interesting

568
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,960
because constands number five is the um

569
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,558
qtl that was given to us by Austin Shep

570
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,200
at rapid genomics so more than likely

571
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:15,519
we're going to continue looking at

572
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,038
constands number five as the potential

573
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,879
activator

574
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,359
here um so yeah so now we're getting to

575
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,120
the uh transcriptome that I mentioned

576
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:28,000
previously the uh the bioinformatic

577
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:30,839
aspect of this study so we took our Leaf

578
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,919
sand samples uh at pre- short days or

579
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:37,000
day Zero and we took our Leaf samples

580
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,880
from the same plants at day seven of

581
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,519
short days and as you can see obviously

582
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,600
the critical day length has is is

583
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:49,679
completely flipped from those two sample

584
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:52,918
types so uh we took uh the the the total

585
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,278
RNA from these Leaf samples and we

586
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,799
sequenced the mrnas which results in

587
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,839
what's called a transcriptome and we

588
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,558
took the transcriptome and performed a

589
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,798
differential expression analysis and the

590
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:09,798
goal of this is simply enough to see

591
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,839
which genes were up or down regulated by

592
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:16,158
the entry into short days and what this

593
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:19,439
is going to do is give us a list of uh

594
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,720
of uh CDL gated genes which are

595
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,200
potentially involved in the transition

596
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,240
into flowering and may also be

597
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,399
interacting with constands to perform

598
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,000
this function so thankfully I was able

599
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:33,278
to find a really brilliant

600
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,079
bioinformatician to help me out with

601
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,839
this um his name is Nathan Johnson from

602
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,839
Vern bioanalytics I'm very grateful for

603
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:44,480
him and we were able to produce a

604
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:48,398
differential expression analysis which

605
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,440
gave us a very long list of genes both

606
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,759
down and upregulated uh upon the entry

607
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,640
into short days and so what this is

608
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:59,278
giving us is our list of CDL gated genes

609
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,480
which we can continue to study to look

610
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,319
for other interactors with constands

611
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,759
which are sort of mediating this

612
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:10,519
transition into short days and I would

613
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,919
also like to mention that we uh we

614
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:15,278
mapped and annotated uh the these

615
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,880
transcriptomes against nine different

616
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:21,480
reference genomes and got coverage

617
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:25,320
ranging from 10 to 70% where the

618
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Jamaican lion genome was easily by far

619
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,278
the highest uh mapping and annotation at

620
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,480
70% so we were really grateful for that

621
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:37,398
complete genome um to use as a

622
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,079
reference so moving forward where it's

623
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:44,719
headed we would like to um actually take

624
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:47,240
prr37 and demonstrate that it does uh

625
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,798
directly interact with constands to

626
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,038
activate ft um as as the model would

627
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,480
suggest and we would also of course like

628
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:59,879
to start studying these other CDL gated

629
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,720
genes which are homologous to rice genes

630
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,000
um which may also be interacting with

631
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,720
constants to have some sort of effect

632
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,798
and additionally any Gene that's

633
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,960
modulated by um critical daylength may

634
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,720
also have some sort of function that

635
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,480
it's performing in the plant um so yeast

636
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,120
two hybrid and then of course we need to

637
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,880
dig into the genes that are at the

638
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:24,278
autoflowering alals not the least of

639
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,600
which including these micro RNA species

640
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:28,798
which I didn't discuss very much but are

641
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:32,158
more than likely critically important in

642
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:35,240
this process and of course also spls

643
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:39,240
which is this whole host of less studied

644
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:42,319
genes and cannabis which activate S so1

645
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,679
so that's where it's headed and that is

646
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:47,918
my talk um I'd like to give a big thanks

647
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,519
to Dr Gerald burkowitz for his continued

648
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,799
support as always especially to Dr

649
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:55,640
Nathan Johnson from Vern bio who was so

650
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:59,158
gracious to help with the bioinformatic

651
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,759
work and uh definitely a Shep from Rapid

652
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:05,440
genomics Who provided us with the list

653
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:08,519
of qtls we used for our qpcr analysis to

654
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,798
begin so thank you very much I'll take

655
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,798
any questions

656
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,038
[Music]

657
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,799
hey nice talk than do you have any

658
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:37,278
evidence that nutrition could affect the

659
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,839
transition to flowering I have seen

660
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,319
several nitrate responsive genes spls

661
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,519
and things like this so do you have any

662
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:46,200
data showing that nutrition could delay

663
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,558
or accelerate the

664
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,440
transition could delay or accelerate

665
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,798
what exactly the transition to the

666
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,240
flowering process the transition to the

667
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,038
flowering process uh nutrition we don't

668
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,240
have any data specifically on the

669
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,480
effects of nutrition affecting gene

670
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,519
expression or anything like that but I

671
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,278
do suspect that you know obviously

672
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,000
having Optimum plant health is going to

673
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:10,880
optimize this transition transition into

674
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,519
flowering but we don't have any data

675
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,360
specifically on on how nutrition would

676
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,359
affect that no thank you

677
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:27,319
yeah I just had a quick question for you

678
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:30,038
so how could this information help

679
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:32,558
smaller up farmers and Growers that are

680
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:35,278
looking to you know get into this

681
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,440
industry that are that is very big

682
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:40,278
dominated but also with the science and

683
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,558
bringing it in and giving their plants

684
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:43,558
that really good chance of producing

685
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,480
excellent

686
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:47,720
quality oh yeah well I think this would

687
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,919
be critical for that actually um because

688
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,200
you know one of the major barriers to

689
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,480
growing cannabis is sort of investment

690
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,759
in the facilities that it requires but

691
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,880
if you're able to grow plants Outdoors

692
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,240
successfully um that would obviously be

693
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,320
the least expensive way to get started

694
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,519
and um you know many growers in Northern

695
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:07,879
latitudes in particular are limited as

696
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,759
to what they can grow outdoors um

697
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,399
because the plant has to finish or else

698
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,919
they won't be able to harvest it in time

699
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:17,439
to actually you know collect a harvest

700
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,480
so uh it's critically important for

701
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,240
people to for breeders in particular to

702
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,880
develop fast flowering

703
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,079
individuals um for the success of

704
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,639
farmers generally but in particular

705
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:32,000
those who want to be um cultivating

706
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:34,158
Outdoors which is probably the preferred

707
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,079
way in terms of you know um

708
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,440
environmental sustainability of course

709
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,359
we want to be we don't want to be

710
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,558
growing underneath lights like that

711
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,519
right and so having a fast flowering

712
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:45,079
individual definitely supports small

713
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,000
farmers and organic farmers in

714
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:51,000
particular and being able to grow in the

715
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,798
field um at Northern latitudes in

716
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,519
particular

717
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:59,038
yeah

718
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,038
okay thank you very much
