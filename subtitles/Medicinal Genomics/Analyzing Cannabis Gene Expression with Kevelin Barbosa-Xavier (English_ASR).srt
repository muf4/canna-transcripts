discussed the team's main objectives in

49
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,439
creating the Cannabis expression Atlas

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,919
how our understanding of the Cannabis

51

genome compares to other commercial

52
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,878
crops how gene expression data can

79
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,598
chavier good morning Kevin thank you so

80
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,799
much for joining us on the podcast good

81
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,839
morning thank you for having me here I

82
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,280
am excited to be here excellent yeah and

83
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,799
I'm excited to talk with you today about

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,000
a new resource that your team has put

85
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,798
together has put together to advance

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,918
cannabis genomics research um and it was

87
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,959
in a new study called cannabis

88
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,560
expression Atlas a comprehensive

89
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,879
resource for integrative analysis of

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,759
Cannabis sativa gene expression it's a

91
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,478
it's an effort and it's research that's

92
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,560
near and dear to our hearts here at

93
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,319
medicinal genomics so I'm definitely

94
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,759
excited to talk with you about

95
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:44,478
it so I think to start it would be great

96
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,360
if you could tell us what inspired you

97
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:51,279
to undertake this study of cannabis and

98
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,800
focus on developing a gene expression

99
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:57,638
database okay um

100
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,120
W I would say that the recent changes in

101
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,639
the regulation of Canabis use and

102
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,639
cultivation around the world have opened

103
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,478
up opportunities to research with the

104
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,680
species to be

105
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:17,159
condos more broadly so this has lead to

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,120
a rap increase in the a mod information

107
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,360
available about

108
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,079
cannabis so including earna sequence

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,319
data and however these they are often in

110
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,318
the raw

111
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:34,759
form uh meaning that the while the ear

112
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:38,360
A6 sequence files are available in

113
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:41,639
public databases for example uh without

114
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,680
proper futuring and Analysis they aren't

115
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,800
very

116
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:50,680
affirmative so and addition to this um

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:55,280
not all of this um data are linked to

118
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,439
published scientific studies so this

119
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,359
this is where the idea of the Cannabis

120
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,478
expression Atlas came

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,800
U the goal was to create a database that

122
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:10,598
translates the earn data so speak um

123
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,918
transforming row sequence information

124
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:16,159
into easy to use and refined data to

125
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,918
anyone interested in

126
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,080
this great so you're you're you're

127
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:25,719
Translating that data to make it more

128
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:28,000
useful yeah excellent um so one thing I

129
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,080
noticed when I I was reading through the

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,918
the abstract in the paper is that you

131
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,478
chose to use the Jamaican lion reference

132
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,639
which again near and dear to our heart

133
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:40,038
at medicinal genomics our team is the

134
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,918
one who who put that together so how

135
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:46,279
does that reference benefit the

136
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:49,478
study um well um during my Nisha

137
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:53,159
research I realized that there was no

138
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:56,120
consensus about um which reference

139
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,960
genome to use in Canabis Research so

140
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:03,199
this made me want to look further to

141
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,839
available genom uh for these species to

142
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,840
choose the most suitable one for using

143
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,038
our

144
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:14,478
study so I found that most of other

145
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:18,598
genomes came from female plants and were

146
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:22,959
from type one or three chemotypes and

147
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:26,878
that's mean that's when the JAMA genome

148
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:30,680
called my attention because first it's a

149
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:35,800
typ two her so which means that has the

150
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:39,280
both CHC and CB gas gen active and

151
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,520
additionally both male and female plants

152
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:46,359
were sequenced and the researchers from

153
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:49,000
the medical genomics had identified uh

154
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,720
Rion corresponding to the Y

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,478
chromosome and this is uh a key feature

156
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,879
compared to other available genomes

157
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:02,878
because which uh as I mentioned are all

158
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:06,240
from female plan so using this genome as

159
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,199
reference uh allow us to enrich our

160
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,158
database and identify expressing returns

161
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,400
for Y chromosomes and genes for example

162
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:18,478
and which can be very useful for helping

163
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,799
researchers to better understand sex

164
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:25,000
differentiation in cannbis for example

165
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,000
excellent so so the Jamaican lion genome

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,319
it covers more ground because it has the

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,320
TCA the CBD and the Y chromosome so

168
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,440
that's great yes it's more

169
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,719
complex

170
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,000
excellent so what were your main

171
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,919
objectives in creating the Cannabis

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,879
expression Atlas and how does this work

173
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:49,519
address gaps in existing cannabis

174
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:52,958
research well um initially uh creating

175
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,879
the Cannabis expression atas was was not

176
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,719
our

177
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:04,039
mango uh when I began my research with

178
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:06,959
cannabis I need this R data um PR to

179
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:11,559
explore gen Express on profiles related

180
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:15,719
to specific tra of the pieces that uh we

181
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:18,599
are working but so so my initial plan

182
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,759
was simply to build an internal database

183
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:26,200
for this purpose uh but as we collected

184
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:29,120
and process the data we realized how

185
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:33,920
slow and laborsome and computationally

186
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,360
the than this person was and so that's

187
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:40,719
when we thought about making the the

188
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,600
process Express data available to other

189
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,399
researchers because not all Labs have

190
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,278
the staff or the computational resarch

191
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:54,078
for this this level of processing uh so

192
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:58,399
we try to develop a tool that would be

193
00:09:54,078 --> 00:10:02,519
useful not only for researchers waiting

194
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:07,078
to download and use expression data uh

195
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:10,200
in other types of analysis but also for

196
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:13,000
those uh just seeking more information

197
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,360
on a specific ding for example and

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,679
without needing to download everything

199
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,560
download all the

200
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:25,439
data um showing another words it lets

201
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:28,119
users um can access gene expression

202
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,839
directly from the tool itself and I

203
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,360
would say that's the

204
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,399
the core of the Canabis expression Atlas

205
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,680
and making complex gene expression

206
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,078
information accessible in a clear and

207
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:46,039
interative form for

208
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:49,359
anyone excellent

209
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:51,519
so kind of taking a step back and just

210
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,800
talking about cannabis genome research

211
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,519
in general how does our understanding

212
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,479
our Collective understanding of the

213
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,959
Cannabis genome compared to other

214
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,959
commercial

215
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:09,278
crops

216
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:11,920
well I think that our understand of the

217
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:15,720
Cannabis genum is advancing quick

218
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:19,838
rapidly uh for other species knowledge

219
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:23,320
was developed Bradly as new technologies

220
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,680
were created but now that cannabis

221
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,879
research is more rly

222
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:32,759
accepted these Advanced Technologies

223
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:35,838
already and well established so it means

224
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:39,439
that the research progress that took a

225
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:43,399
decades for other crops like corn or

226
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:47,160
soybeans can be achieved much faster for

227
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:51,000
cannabis uh that said um there is still

228
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:54,679
a lot uh to uncover about this

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,879
pcing but I believe that in just a few

230
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:00,519
years we reach a level of understanding

231
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,039
comparable to what we current have for

232
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:07,320
major commercial crops

233
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:10,919
so I think that W that's that's great

234
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,440
that's encouraging to hear um now from

235
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:17,078
the Practical side in in your experience

236
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,279
to what extent have cannabis cultivators

237
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:21,278
embraced using genomics and genomic

238
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:29,440
tools well I think that uh it depends on

239
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:33,399
whether we are taking about um is

240
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,880
cultivators or big farms MH because I

241
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,919
believe that big farms are already using

242
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:44,559
genome tools to guide breeding process

243
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:49,439
but I believe that in general the for

244
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:55,638
cators itself the use of gamic tools

245
00:12:49,440 --> 00:13:00,480
it's um let's say indirect so through

246
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:04,560
for example SE of newly developed C

247
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:09,839
so I think that it depends of the small

248
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:12,599
C ver or big farms yeah that makes sense

249
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,680
okay so I want to dig in a little bit to

250
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:20,680
um to the study that your team published

251
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:22,519
um and so it excuse me so it revealed

252
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:24,799
substantial variability in gene

253
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,360
expression among different tissues and

254
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:31,479
chemotypes so what were some of the most

255
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,480
surprising things that you found in that

256
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,480
analysis I think that the first thing

257
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:42,799
that c our attention was that we

258
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,360
initially expected that the Y jeans to

259
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:49,479
show more specific expression in sample

260
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,120
in samples from male

261
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,278
flowers but only a small proportion of

262
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,120
the genes on the white chromosome are

263
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:03,198
expressed exclusively in the

264
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,440
flow while many other genes were

265
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,919
expressed in samples from other Jesus

266
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:13,959
including those from female

267
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:17,039
PLS and so searching about that uh I see

268
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:20,638
that this PO can be explained

269
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,679
by some researchers indicating that only

270
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,198
a small proportion of the white

271
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:30,399
chromosome is unique with the majority

272
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:33,439
being shared with the X chromosome

273
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:38,639
so uh but it's still a thing that need

274
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:42,519
more deep attention um another notable

275
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:47,039
finding was uh the clustering of the

276
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:51,000
Tricom samples because as you know troms

277
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:55,480
are where the synthesis and storage of

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,480
the medicinal compounds are in the plant

279
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,800
and we observe that the triom samples

280
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,920
showed um very similar expression

281
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:09,240
profiles regardless of chemotype

282
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:11,759
indicating that it's likely that only a

283
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,919
small number of Genies that

284
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,919
differentiate these

285
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,240
chemotypes but again it's something that

286
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,039
need more deeper um

287
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,879
interpretations wow that's surprising so

288
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,919
so you're saying parts of the Y

289
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,838
chromosome can actually be found in

290
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:35,919
female plants

291
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:38,759
yeah genius prant from the the Y region

292
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:43,679
also have expression in other cheers

293
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:48,120
including in female um chees in the case

294
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:51,120
flowers interesting very interesting um

295
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,440
so could you discuss the significance of

296
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,839
these and other findings for cannabis

297
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,560
plant biology and you know practical

298
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:03,360
applications

299
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:06,758
yes uh I would say that understanding or

300
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,440
subject of study in this case the the

301
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:14,480
Cannabis is the most crucial step to

302
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:18,000
cultivating and utilizing this plant as

303
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:23,440
efficiently as possible and with that in

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,720
mind I believe that um or two will

305
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,959
significantly aiding generating

306
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,560
knowledge about the plant in a in a

307
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,119
broad sense

308
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:35,318
uh because it can be useful to those

309
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,799
focus on Industrial properties as well

310
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:42,120
as those interested in the medical

311
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,559
attributes uh and by providing clear and

312
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,000
accessible gene expression data we

313
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,758
believe that we are helping to PVE the

314
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,480
way for better informed research and

315
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:56,440
applications in this area excellent and

316
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,120
more specifically how might this gene

317
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,759
expression information support advanced

318
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,759
in areas like plant breeding or genetic

319
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,400
engineering okay uh as I mentioned

320
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:14,959
earlier uh our understanding of the

321
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,919
subject of the study is the key and gen

322
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,480
Express information can be used

323
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,600
to

324
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,759
identify genus directly associated with

325
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,480
traits of interest for example such as

326
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:34,038
kabite synthesis fiber produ

327
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:37,360
or SE development so knowing what genis

328
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:40,359
are involved and how they are their

329
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:43,479
expression profiles influence these

330
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:47,079
traits uh is crucial for making

331
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:50,798
decisions about genetic modification for

332
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:55,399
example it could help in modifying

333
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:58,679
variety by adding or silen in je uh to

334
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,720
control the presence or the intensity of

335
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,440
the certain traits so a practical

336
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,839
application might be ensuring that hemp

337
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,798
vares like chemotype 3 for example don't

338
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:14,119
produce an THC if it was the

339
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:17,440
interes excellent

340
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,439
excellent all

341
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:25,279
right so getting into more specifically

342
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,919
the uh cannabis expression Atlas could

343
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,000
you walk us through some of the main

344
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:33,480
features of the tool and what types of

345
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,079
users do you envision benefiting from it

346
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,919
certainly uh this to was designed to be

347
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:42,519
as comprehensive as possible so that

348
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,520
users don't need

349
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:50,319
to rely on multiple platforms to GA the

350
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:53,798
information they need about Genie so we

351
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:56,079
integrated ER n express data with

352
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:59,798
functional information about the

353
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,119
genus um so for example we have an

354
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:04,720
interative

355
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:09,000
table where users can explore cannabis

356
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,558
genes even if they don't know the Gen ID

357
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,319
because users can search for Genies by

358
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:16,678
name SE ATP int and find our related

359
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:19,960
Genies in this

360
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,759
database they can also search by

361
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,360
transcription Factor family names by

362
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:29,200
genology terms by Express and PS

363
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:33,158
categories so if someone is is

364
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,880
interested in identifying housekeeping

365
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:40,000
Genies or chy specific Genies they can

366
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,039
easily find the information as well for

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,159
all the the expression classes that

368
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:51,400
have and additionally we included a hit

369
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,760
map to visualize expression Gene of

370
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,038
Interest with

371
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,599
Will which will help to uh interpret

372
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:03,400
some

373
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:08,000
results and beside that given the lack

374
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:11,759
of organization in gulture across Canam

375
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,759
genom and in another

376
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,919
pled in can

377
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:22,519
genom uh we included a bus too in the

378
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:26,679
kabus express outlas and this means that

379
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:29,319
if the user is interested in a specific

380
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,038
joury but doesn't have have enough

381
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:35,439
information to search for it through the

382
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:39,319
order tools in the in

383
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,919
Theos they can simply input the Gen or

384
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:46,079
the protein sequency and do a blast

385
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:49,280
search again blast again the atos to

386
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,359
identify the genu in the database and

387
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,158
access the related

388
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,599
information and I believe that this two

389
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:01,240
will be especially useful for

390
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:05,319
researchers perhaps not directly for

391
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:09,120
catas because while it's easy to use and

392
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:12,639
intuitive of basic understanding of gen

393
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:16,199
nenat and how to interpret genomic and

394
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,840
transcript to data is necessary to fully

395
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,400
Leverage The Tool are there any

396
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,959
limitations in the Cannabis expression

397
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,759
Atlas that you aim to address with any

398
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,919
future

399
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:32,359
updates well um in the future we plan to

400
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,559
make some Visual and navigation

401
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:39,639
Improvement to the tool such as

402
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:42,879
enhancing the mobile version and making

403
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,559
the interactions between different pages

404
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,760
and internum tools more

405
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:51,480
simulus and another feature we didn't

406
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:55,038
include in this version but plan to

407
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,558
implement in the future is the ability

408
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:01,519
to search for information based on

409
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:05,278
YouTuber names because I believe this

410
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:07,599
could be useful for some users who are

411
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:12,000
more focused on specific

412
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:14,839
varieties and we are also open to

413
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,359
suggestions excellent okay and and

414
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:22,038
wrapping up how do you foresee this

415
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:25,119
database influencing Global cannabis

416
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:28,200
research well I really hope that this

417
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:31,278
database will play a significant role in

418
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,798
ADV in global cannab search um by

419
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:38,159
providing a comprehensive uh sess

420
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:41,200
resource for Gen Express data um by

421
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,840
making this information freely available

422
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,240
and easy to use and we hope to

423
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:51,959
accelerate research across various

424
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:56,120
fields from additional to Industrial

425
00:22:51,960 --> 00:23:00,319
applications and because this database

426
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:03,038
can serve us uh

427
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:07,278
because I believe that this database can

428
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:11,759
serve as a foundation for new studies uh

429
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:14,679
enabling researchers to quickly access

430
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,759
and analyze data without need for

431
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,798
extensive

432
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:24,480
preprocessing so in the end in the end

433
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:27,879
of the day uh this two will help unify

434
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,558
and streamline the global research for

435
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,799
leading to to a more efficient and

436
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,119
collaborative approach to understanding

437
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:38,639
Canabis

438
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:41,798
biology yeah that's that's excellent and

439
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,799
again that that very well aligns with

440
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:48,960
our company and our ethos of trying to

441
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:51,440
put as much data public and um easily

442
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,519
accessible to to enhance the

443
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,679
understanding for everyone so that's

444
00:23:53,519 --> 00:24:00,000
great that's great to hear um all right

445
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,200
kevn thank you thank you again so much

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,278
for for joining me on the podcast um

447
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,319
anyone who wants to check out the uh

448
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,359
cannabis expression Atlas I'll put a

449
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,720
link in the show description so they can

450
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,879
easily get to it and a link to the study

451
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:18,159
as well so they can read up about more

452
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:21,080
about how you put that together okay and

453
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,559
um again thanks so much for joining us

454
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:26,558
keep up the good work and hopefully we

455
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:28,980
can do this again soon yes me

456
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:33,440
too thank you
