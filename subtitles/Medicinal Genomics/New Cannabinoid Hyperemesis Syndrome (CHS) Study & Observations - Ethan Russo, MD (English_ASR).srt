00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,629
[Music]

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,560
you know so between 204 in the present

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,679
there wasn't a lot of explanation of

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:27,960
what CHS was from now there had been

5
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:31,719
again studies that showed that a marked

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:36,879
upregulation of the hypo thalamic P

7
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:39,840
pituitary um system um so basically

8
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:43,359
stress responses now you bet if you're

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,840
in pain and you're nauseated and

10
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:51,039
vomiting you got stress but I mean this

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,879
is really serious stress um this isn't

12
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,920
you know simple situation of of vomiting

13
00:00:53,878 --> 00:01:00,320
a couple of times because of a virus um

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,239
people lose weight um they get merked

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,198
abnormalities uh sometimes of

16
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:06,759
electrolytes you know the mineral

17
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,840
balance in the blood and there've

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,080
actually been two deaths attributed to

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,118
this because of how bad the vomiting was

20
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,879
from

21
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:23,879
CHS um so you know there are certain

22
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:26,319
markers but until um recently we didn't

23
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,319
have an explanation for this why does

24
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,839
one person get it and another one

25
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,359
doesn't so this is the reason

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,200
we wanted to examine it with the

27
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,319
hypothesis that perhaps certain people

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,680
have a genetic susceptibility to this so

29
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:48,239
that's what we wanted to test um so uh

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,320
with endocan health uh we put together a

31
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:56,959
study uh starting with a survey again of

32
00:01:51,319 --> 00:02:00,359
over 500 people and um we for entry as a

33
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:03,319
CHS patient we had very strict criteria

34
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,799
we didn't want there to be mistakes so

35
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:09,280
first thing was they had to carry a

36
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,599
diagnosis of CHS in other words somebody

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
had seen them and said that this wasn't

38
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,799
what it

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,479
was um then additionally they had to

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,200
have active symptoms we didn't want

41
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,280
people in that may have been

42
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:25,079
misdiagnosed as having CHS but we're

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,239
okay now in other words they didn't

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,760
really have it um so that whittel things

45
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,759
down

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:40,519
um we um we got it down to uh something

47
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,039
like 200 candidates and um they were

48
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,959
offered

49
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:48,479
um genetic testing which is done with a

50
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,000
swab in the mouth um to look at the

51
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,318
DNA unfortunately there was a lot of

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,360
attrition between step two and step

53
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:59,799
three uh because only 28 CHS confirmed

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,319
CHS patients returned the kit after

55
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,319
after all of them and said that they

56
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,719
wanted

57
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:08,158
it the reason for that was we had a

58
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:11,080
great deal of push back from the CHS

59
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,798
online community there were people that

60
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,360
questioned our motives um thought we

61
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,560
were in this for the money um didn't

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,519
like our methodology for one reason or

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,120
another and so there was an active

64
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,879
movement to uh tell people not to

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,920
participate um so that wasn't helpful um

66
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,079
and then we needed to compare them to to

67
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,759
somebody so there were some people who

68
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,000
took the survey that were high uh volume

69
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:44,039
cannabis users um interestingly about

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,360
the same four grams a day who didn't

71
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,438
have CHS symptoms and didn't have a

72
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,280
diagnosis so th those were the

73
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:53,719
comparison

74
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,959
groups um what we found was a little

75
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:58,719
surprising so the first hypothesis was

76
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,878
well there's got to be a problem with

77
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:05,719
the CB1 Gene the gene that codes for the

78
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:09,598
CB1 receptor um we didn't see that as

79
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:12,400
mentioned previously you do see that in

80
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:16,599
uh cyclic vomiting syndrome so instantly

81
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,079
we had uh uh difference between the two

82
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,320
syndromes we also hypothesized two other

83
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,240
things that it could be a problem with

84
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:29,279
the metabolism of THC how it's broken

85
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,199
down we did get confirmation of that

86
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,478
because

87
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,840
there was a statistically significant

88
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:42,599
difference in a mutation in a um cyp 2c9

89
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:45,198
Gene between the CHS patients and the

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,800
heavy usage of cannabis that didn't have

91
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,639
symptoms so

92
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,160
cyp2c9 is the um enzyme in the liver

93
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,800
that breaks down

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,000
THC so you might understand if there

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,600
were a mutation there perhaps that it

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
wasn't as efficient breaking down THC

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,680
that levels would be higher and this

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,038
could produce this funny

99
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,079
reaction um the third um hypothesis that

100
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:19,839
we had was that there would be an issue

101
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:22,318
with the trpv1 trip V1 Gene we thought

102
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:27,038
of that because one of the interesting

103
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:30,199
things about CHS is that hot water

104
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,839
exposure seems to help and

105
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,319
interestingly something else that's hot

106
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:37,839
application of capsus anointment on the

107
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,080
skin the active ingredient in Chili

108
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,599
Peppers also temporarily relieve

109
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:46,279
symptoms uh that turned out to be the

110
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,919
case too again we saw statistically

111
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:53,359
significant difference uh in the number

112
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:56,399
of mutation seen in the CHS patients in

113
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,160
the trip V1 Gene is compared to the high

114
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:03,679
volume cannabis users without CHS

115
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,560
um so uh then there were a couple of

116
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,639
things we hadn't uh

117
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,439
hypothesized there were two genes

118
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,720
related to dopamine metabolism with

119
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:19,879
abnormalities uh one was uh for the gene

120
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:24,240
that codes the dopamine type 2 uh

121
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:26,918
receptor um this is an interesting uh

122
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,160
receptor in that it's the target for

123
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:33,918
antipsychotic drugs um

124
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,240
and um when people have a mutation there

125
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:39,359
as we saw in the CHS patients they're at

126
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,079
risk for a whole bunch of things um

127
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,680
addiction to other

128
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:49,240
substances um also uh risk for psychosis

129
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,879
and other psychiatric issues to a strong

130
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,120
degree U whether it be um depression

131
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,759
anxiety

132
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:02,038
Etc there was also a mutation in What's

133
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,240
called the CT catacol omey transferase

134
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:09,439
Gene this is the gene that breaks down

135
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:13,280
dopamine um and again if uh there were a

136
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:17,000
problem there um you might get a buildup

137
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:19,878
of dopamine that would um provoke

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,680
addictive uh Behavior or that kind of

139
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,400
thing right and then there was one that

140
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,079
made sense though because all of what

141
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:31,318
we've mentioned so

142
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,318
far um sort of

143
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:38,000
it informs the symptomatology and

144
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,960
phenomenology of CHS meaning that it

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,598
helps explain some of the symptoms um

146
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,519
you know

147
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,959
trpv1 among other things has to do with

148
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,519
propulsion in the gut if things aren't

149
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:55,799
moving you will tend to vomit um it also

150
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,639
is in the brain and is associated with

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,280
anxiety and pain um so things begin to

152
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,639
make a lot more sense but the fifth

153
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:07,559
mutation that we saw was something we

154
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
had not expected um this is a gene

155
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,800
called

156
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,878
abca1 it has to do with cholesterol

157
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,158
metabolism and this one's a little

158
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,800
ominous because people who have

159
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:21,759
mutations on this Gene may be

160
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,319
susceptible to a number of problems

161
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,879
later in life specifically coronary

162
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:32,759
artery disease type 2 diabetes

163
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:35,519
metis um and Alzheimer disease so we do

164
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,879
not know yet um because this hasn't been

165
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,360
around yet our folks with CHS that have

166
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,200
this mutation at greater risk for these

167
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,959
disorders the answer is quite possibly

168
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:51,560
