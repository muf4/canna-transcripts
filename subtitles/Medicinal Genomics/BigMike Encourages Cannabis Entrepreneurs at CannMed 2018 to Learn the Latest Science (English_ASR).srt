1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,429
how is big egg and big farmer going to

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,108
alter the marketplace for young

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:10,379
entrepreneurs who want to get in the

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:13,530
cannabis business well here's the thing

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,298
big AG and Big Pharma are already here

6
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:18,059
there's a tremendous amount of

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:21,300
opportunity as our industry grows and

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:24,000
here's the thing there's a lot of small

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,510
businesses that are going to be acquired

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,359
by big AG and Big Pharma so don't wait

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,570
get into the marketplace find a good

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,760
company with some solid management and a

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,439
great vision and go to work for them

14
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,649
because the odds of them getting

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,949
acquired are really really good and

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:47,219
there's going to probably be a minimum

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,070
of a quarter million to half a million

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,879
jobs new jobs that will be created here

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,219
in America over the next several years I

20
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:59,189
want to say this I wouldn't be where I

21
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,609
am today if it wasn't for hard studying

22
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:06,688
and reading a lot of books and finding

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,269
great scientists to talk to and share

24
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,949
different ideas with and I want to

25
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:14,099
encourage all the young entrepreneurs

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,219
and business owners who want to get into

27
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:20,969
the cannabis space to pursue the science

28
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:23,310
aspect of cannabis just like I did that

29
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:27,329
is where I made the biggest gains and

30
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,820
when I had science behind me advanced

31
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:33,929
nutrients Big Mike's blends are able to

32
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:37,679
grow at a faster better rate science has

33
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,960
always been the answer to success and by

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,680
the way that's what I like about can med

35
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,709
because the best cannabinoid researchers

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,360

I love cannabis I love talking about it

43
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:08,909
I love hearing new ideas and most of all

44
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,700

45
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:14,009
cannabis because it isn't what a lot of
