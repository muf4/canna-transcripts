2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,640
so are there Regional considerations

3
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:22,159
here for for weed control in hemp yes

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,679
there are um you know some species are

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,198
not uh uniformally distributed across

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,079
the United States there are certain

7
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,719
geographies that have uh different

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:36,719
problems um I think across most of the

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,120
the midwestern uh cropping region the

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,239
amaranthus species are a problem if

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,199
you're familiar with amaranthus seed

12
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,078
it's it's basically they're plants in

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,199
the same genus as that food crop that

14
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,840
have become dominant agricultural weeds

15
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:54,039
and they've evolved resistances to

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,920
multiple herbicides that have become a

17
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,879
critical part of our crop production

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,600
systems so um as they evolve very

19
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,640
quickly we're losing some of the

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,920
herbicide tools that our Farmers have

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,319
relied upon and uh and something there's

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,640
something very special about those weeds

23
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,359
so those amaranthus weeds are dious

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,599
meaning that they are males and they are

25
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,879
females and they have to cross-pollinate

26
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,839
to produce seeds and those are the only

27
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,280
species in our system that are what we

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,759
call driver weeds that

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,159
um that are evolving herbicide

30
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,280
resistance so quickly so the genetic

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,159
Exchange between those plants is in a

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,439
sense driving Evolution and genetic

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,920
variation and uh and of course the the

34
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,679
plant that we're introducing into the

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,240
system you know this is our first dous

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,360
plant as far as I've worked with that is

37
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,839
a crop species now and does that bring

38
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,959
with it other uh

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,520
challenges well potentially right

40
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,000
because uh hemp is the uh it's the

41
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,798
original weed

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,840
right the name yeah

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,240
so uh you know we have in Illinois a

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,560
victory hemp left over from World War II

45
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,159
era that still grows in the ditch Banks

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
and roadsides around agricultural Fields

47
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,400
uh so it's still it still exists it

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,120
still is persistent so um that's another

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,560
uh another research question in the

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,840
fields where we're growing hemp for a

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,239
crop you know uh we're going to have to

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,479
manage those volunteers as we rotate

53
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,719
into other crops so how how easy is that

54
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,479
going to continue to be are we a are we

55
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,479
going to be able to continue to manage

56
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,439
hemp which is very susceptible right now

57
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:40,759
to the herbicides that we use so right

58
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,479
now yes yeah and I'm I'm glad you kind

59
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:46,079
of brought up the the ditch weed that um

60
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,359
is still out there is that and is that a

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,519
weed for all intents and purposes for if

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,800
you're growing hemp could that

63
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,000
potentially be an issue um well it

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,760
depends right if you're growing floral

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,959
uh CBD hemp then yes that is an issue

66
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,359
for you and your product quality um and

67
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,519
potentially for uh for other crops as

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,200
well but I think more importantly it's

69
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,879
it's um it's important to consider that

70
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,119
as a reservoir for very important

71
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,598
genetic traits that might be useful for

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,039
future Crop Production those plants have

73
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,479
existed for uh you know decades

74
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,280
successfully in these areas they are

75
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,840
tolerant to the environmental conditions

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,318
that they're being exposed to and to the

77
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,519
ecological interactions so so that

78
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,798
shouldn't be dismissed um I don't think

79
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,200
they should be devalued I think that in

80
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:40,959
the future they could have a very real

81
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:43,759
um a very a very real um contribution to

82
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,759
Future breeding
