1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
I'm here to talk to you today about

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,280
something that medicinal genomics has

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:11,089
developed and I think it's going to

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:15,990
revolutionary revolutionize testing

5
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:17,730
using qPCR methods so I've been working

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,629
at medicinal genomics as an R&amp;D

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,980
scientist for the past five years and

8
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:25,108
over those past five years we've

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,990
developed a lot of tools to help the

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,150
cannabis community particularly in in

11
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,000
the genetics of cannabis as Kevin talked

12
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:36,859
earlier about Jamaican Lyon and in

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,689
microbial testing so um

14
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:42,170
microbial testing while it's not the

15
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:46,289
most glamorous idea is very important

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:49,439
every state that is legal to sell

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,808
cannabis has potency having met have

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,509
heavy-metal testing and microbial

19
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,948
testing and like I said it's not the

20
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,159
most glamorous but it is the most

21
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:02,000
important because the only confirmed

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,438
deaths in cannabis have come from

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,989
microbial contamination

24
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,849
Aspergillus in particular although with

25
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:10,589
the recent controversy with vape pens

26
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,750
that might be up for debate and I think

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,439
there's some talks on that maybe

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,159
tomorrow

29
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:19,169
so as we've just heard cannabis is used

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,728
as a medicine and there are

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,140
immunocompromised patients out there

32
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:23,969
some that don't even realize that

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,769
they're immunocompromised so it's really

34
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,349
important to make sure that the cannabis

35
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,750
that that are receiving is free of

36
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,459
microbial contamination so it's

37
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,739
imperative that the testing labs have

38
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,048
the ability to accurately detect for

39
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:40,560
harmful harmful microbial contamination

40
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,840
on cannabis and there's generally two

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,840
methods that are out there for microbial

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,329
testing molecular methods and we have

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
medicinal genomics have qpcr testing and

44
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:52,709
culturing methods which is your

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,540
traditional does it grow on a plate and

46
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:59,059
they both have as you can see there's

47
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,740
qpcr methods have more pros than

48
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,618
culturing methods in that it's more it's

49
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:07,019
faster it's more accurate you can

50
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,628
specifically target the contaminant that

51
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,299
you're looking for and it's scalable

52
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:13,949
whereas culture methods are slower

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,280
they're more inaccurate they're not

54
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,209
specific and it's harder to scale but

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,620
the one thing that

56
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:28,620
qpcr lacks that culture methods has is

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:31,500
that can I go back is that if the DNA

58
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,170
DNA is present and a qPCR a site is

59
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,979
going to be detected it doesn't matter

60
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:40,979
if it's live or if it's dead so there's

61
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:43,439
two types of testing in in the in

62
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,810
cannabis microbial testing qualitative

63
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,329
or presence/absence testing and this

64
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,890
requires that no amount of the target

65
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,440
organism be present in one gram of

66
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,269
sample so these are your four

67
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,060
Aspergillus species Aspergillus flavus

68
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,340
from a goddess schneider Tereus

69
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,830
Salmonella stackin e.coli and then you

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,400
have qualitative or the total testing

71
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,890
testing and this allows threshold limits

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,140
of the of their to be microbial

73
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:13,949
contamination so for example total usin

74
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:16,649
mold most states have a 10,000 CFU limit

75
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:19,949
a total aerobic bacteria 100,000 CF

76
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,590
either way so like I said before qPCR

77
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:25,469
detects all DNA whether it be live or

78
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,180
dead and this can be a concern in the

79
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,889
cannabis industry because there are some

80
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,599
cultivators out there that want to make

81
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,488
sure that their cannabis is free of this

82
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,650
microbial contamination so that will it

83
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,750
will pass and so they're doing

84
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,819
techniques like a radiating they're

85
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,830
killing the microbes but killing the

86
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,620
microbes still leaves behind their DNA

87
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:47,310
and qpcr methods will pick up that did

88
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:51,000
DNA but we've developed a method to

89
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:57,150
solve this problem and it's called Grimm

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,520
reefer so like I said before the pro of

91
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,039
qPCR testing is that there are primers

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,770
and probes specific to amplify that's

93
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,379
the DNA that you're targeting however it

94
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,810
cannot distinguish between live or dead

95
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,870
DNA and the solution that we came up

96
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,810
with is eliminate the contaminating dead

97
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,569
DNA again by this method called grim

98
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:28,720
reaper so I'm just gonna go over

99
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:31,659
see how this if I pointed it sure so

100
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,650
it's a simple upfront 10-minute

101
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,570
incubation at 37 degrees Celsius what

102
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:39,849
you do is you add in your Grimm reefer

103
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:43,540
enzyme along with a buffer into your

104
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:46,270
sample this all happens before DNA

105
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,150
extraction and lysis the grim reaper

106
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:53,319
enzyme comes in and it chews up any of

107
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:56,679
your free-floating or dead DNA after 10

108
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:59,430
minutes at 37 C you add in the mg C

109
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,439
lysis buffer that lysis buffer

110
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,480
deactivates the enzyme the lysis buffer

111
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:08,290
while deactivating the grim reefer

112
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,740
enzyme also opens up the D the cells of

113
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:16,210
your live organism thus now you have

114
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:19,629
only your live DNA's you live organisms

115
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:22,089
DNA present and then what we've added is

116
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:26,110
we've added a positive control into this

117
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:28,479
mix and this positive control is a DNA

118
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,730
template that you add in to ensure that

119
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,800
your enzyme is in fact has been

120
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,610
deactivated and that will later down the

121
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,129
line be tested in your q PCR reaction so

122
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,480
after the positive control after you add

123
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:42,129
in your lysis buffer you had any

124
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,830
positive control and then you proceed

125
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:50,319
with the mgc DNA extraction procedure

126
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:52,300
and that positive control is in there

127
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,009
because if you have your original method

128
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,889
versus your Grim Reaper method you

129
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:58,480
expect that that positive control DNA is

130
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,959
not going to change it should be exactly

131
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:07,270
the same CT value as the original method

132
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:10,870
versus the grim reaper method so so to

133
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:13,719
test this theory we took any alive ecoli

134
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,280
culture and this was an e coli culture

135
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,050
that had only been growing for four

136
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,869
hours to ensure that the majority of the

137
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,939
culture was in fact live and we split

138
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,920
that into we put that in in the presence

139
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:27,870
of ham and put it into twelve different

140
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,870
tubes six of the tubes

141
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,860
and that was the wrong button six of the

142
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,350
tubes were treated with the original

143
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,080
method six of the tubes were treated

144
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,180
with the grim reaper method and

145
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:46,139
increasing copies of salmonella DNA were

146
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:48,900
spiked into each tube they were treated

147
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,909
10 minutes 37 degrees and then after the

148
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,819
10 minutes that mgc lysis buffer was

149
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,760
spiked in to kill the to stop the enzyme

150
00:06:53,819 --> 00:07:03,839
and the positive control was added in

151
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:06,209
DNA DNA extraction happens so 12 samples

152
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:10,769
it was running triplicates of a total of

153
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:13,889
36 q PCR reactions were run so these are

154
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:15,750
the results for e.coli and so the

155
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:19,349
hypothesis is is that due to the

156
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,149
presence of e.coli there ecoli results

157
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,550
for the groom Reath reefer method may be

158
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:26,009
lower than the original method but since

159
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,470
ecoli was fresh it freshly cultured

160
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,329
ecoli results will be more similar

161
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,120
between the methods and the internal

162
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:34,889
control results and again like I said

163
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,780
this was only a 4-hour equal eye culture

164
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,269
and as you can see there's no

165
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,099
statistical no statistical significant

166
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:43,859
difference between the e.coli results on

167
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,260
the grim reaper results so on your

168
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,949
x-axis you have the increasing amounts

169
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:54,899
of Salmonella DNA and on your y-axis is

170
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:57,360
the cycle of Q PCR cycles of qpcr goes

171
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:00,000
to 40 and the results are consistent

172
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,500
with the hypothesis that the Grim Reaper

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,560
met the Grim Reaper method does not

174
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:08,040
interfere with DNA from live cells and

175
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,569
both methods demonstrated robustness and

176
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,129
that there was no impact from the

177
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:16,199
increasing amount of Salmonella DNA and

178
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:18,420
so these are the Salmonella results and

179
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,149
the hypothesis here is that free

180
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,879
Salmonella DNA will not be detected for

181
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:27,329
the Grim Reaper method until the amount

182
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,430
of free DNA exhausts the enzyme and as

183
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:32,610
you can see the Grim Reaper method

184
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,850
consistently deactivated this element

185
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,250
Ella

186
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:38,009
until you got to the 4.0 2,000,000

187
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,269
copies and you see that purple bar there

188
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:43,179
is the Salomon Ellis

189
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:46,889
like no in qpcr results the higher the

190
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:49,659
signal value the less DNA is there and

191
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:52,240
so the results for the Grim Reaper

192
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:54,579
method are exclusive of free DNA as long

193
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,269
as DNA is less than 4.2 million copies

194
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,720
and just to give you an idea a tenfold

195
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:04,509
dilution is represented by a 3.3 CT

196
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,139
shift so for the 6.0 3 million copies

197
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:10,179
there was an approximate 12.9 3 CT shift

198
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:14,319
was which is about a 75 hundred fold

199
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:16,029
reduction in free DNA so now here's the

200
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,810
Grim Reaper positive control and as I

201
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:21,789
said earlier that the hope here is that

202
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:23,829
the enzyme is deactivated with the

203
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:25,419
addition of the mgc lysis buffer and

204
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,220
therefore you should not see any

205
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:30,099
difference in your Gremory for positive

206
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,830
control between the two methods and

207
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,519
that's exactly what you see here the

208
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:39,940
null hypothesis cannot be rejected in

209
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,240
the 95% confidence interval since the

210
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,630
p-value was 0.16 one so there is no

211
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,860
significant no statistically significant

212
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,689
difference between the Grim Reaper

213
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,940
control and the Guru Murray in the

214
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,590
original method and this result is

215
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,410
consistent with the hypothesis that

216
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,990
river e4 enzyme is no longer digesting

217
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:02,139
free DNA after incubation and after

218
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,899
lysis buffer is added and both methods

219
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:06,639
demonstrate robustness as there's no

220
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:10,569
impact from the increasing amount of

221
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:13,360
Salmonella DNA and so another feature

222
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,460
that the M gcq PCR assays have is we

223
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,399
have built in an internal control and

224
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:25,300
that's targeting the Cannabis DNA and so

225
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,939
due to the inherent presence of free DNA

226
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:30,849
in the plant material you would expect

227
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:33,040
that a dried sample is going to have

228
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,710
some dead DNA so you would expect to see

229
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,839
the internal control shift between the

230
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,930
original method and the Grim Reaper

231
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,300
magnet and that's exactly what we see

232
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:45,219
here the null hypothesis the Grim Reaper

233
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,349
in original method internal control

234
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,139
result results are the same can be

235
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:53,450
rejected at a 99% confidence interval

236
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:56,240
since the resultant p-value is 2.4

237
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,970
five times 10 to the negative 25th so

238
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,190
there is a statistically significant

239
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,050
less hemp DNA detected in the groom

240
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,120
reefer method verse the original method

241
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:07,089
and the results are consistent with the

242
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,600
hypothesis

243
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:13,940
so these are some qPCR curves this is

244
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,600
utilizing four different channels in the

245
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,120
instrument the fam hacks sy5 and rocks

246
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:26,570
channel and let's see if I can get this

247
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:29,000
to work so so the orange signal that you

248
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,490
see here is the Salmonella signal and

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,259
this is at four hundred and two thousand

250
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,690
copies and as you can see with the Grimm

251
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,360
reefer method that orange signal goes

252
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,850
away and then when you get down here at

253
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,710
the eight million copies you see the

254
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,460
cell Mennella signal very strong here in

255
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:48,950
the orange and it decreases after the

256
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,139
Grim Reaper method so this is an

257
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:57,350
approximate I believe it's a 12 C T

258
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:59,889
shift here so here's some conclusion

259
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:03,230
summaries the Grim Reaper method is not

260
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:06,819
metabolizing DNA and viable cells it's

261
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:09,710
not metabolizing DNA after deactivation

262
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,890
the Grim Reaper method is capable of

263
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:14,570
metabolizing free DNA up to 4.2 million

264
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:17,629
copies

265
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,400
both the original and group Grim Reaper

266
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:23,539
methods demonstrate a high level of

267
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,669
precision both methods demonstrate

268
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:27,949
robustness for 'allah analytes observed

269
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:30,110
as there was no impact for the

270
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,330
increasing amount of Salmonella DNA and

271
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,190
the original method results are

272
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,680
proportional to the amount of free DNA

273
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,180
plus DNA and viable cells and I

274
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,689
apologize for the numbering being wrong

275
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:44,239
there so now that we had shown that this

276
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,820
worked in the lab we wanted to see what

277
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,419
would happen in real cannabis samples

278
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,730
because we're not a cannabis testing lab

279
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:57,169
so we don't have access to actual

280
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:59,000
samples so we asked for independent labs

281
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:00,240
if they would be interested in beta

282
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,049
testing this

283
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,730
and they said yes and so now I'm just

284
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,318
gonna take us so there's a lot of

285
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,509
results I'm just gonna go over our snap

286
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:11,458
shop I kind of picked some from the

287
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:14,759
total aerobic assay and I just wanted to

288
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:17,399
point some things out here so lab one

289
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:23,220
what you can see here is that there is a

290
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:25,708
shift in the TAC signal it goes from 25

291
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,829
point two to twenty seven point nine

292
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:31,049
five there is also a large shift in the

293
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:33,868
SEC G signal that's that internal

294
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,818
internal cannabis control you see it go

295
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:37,850
from a twenty six point two one all the

296
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:40,528
way to a thirty two point three six and

297
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,240
the grim reaper positive controls are

298
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:47,610
very similar for the two and that's what

299
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:50,339
you would expect lab to without with the

300
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,039
original method there was a detection at

301
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,379
25.87 but with the grim reform method

302
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,688
none was detected and this indicates

303
00:13:55,379 --> 00:14:00,749
that most of the DNA that was present on

304
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:04,349
this sample was in fact dead and you can

305
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:07,019
see that there was a large hacks s ECG

306
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,808
signal shift here yet the grim reaper

307
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:13,259
method is positive control remains the

308
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:14,639
same so I don't know what this sample

309
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,369
could have experienced both the large

310
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,509
shift in s ECG signal this could have

311
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:22,980
been a sample that had been heavily

312
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:24,959
irradiated lab three you can see that

313
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,659
the tach signal isn't really changing

314
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:31,349
all that much so this is indicating that

315
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:34,350
most of the organisms present on this

316
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,269
sample are in fact alive as you're not

317
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,178
seeing that CT shift and there's a

318
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:42,119
threesome we are about a 3 CT shift and

319
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:44,249
the SEC G signal and again the the

320
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:47,579
positive control and the size 5 is is

321
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:51,389
similar and finally lab 4 you see a very

322
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:55,019
large shift again in that tach signal 26

323
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:56,850
to 30 7 the HEC signal there's also a

324
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,009
shift and again the internal control

325
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:03,829
signal I mean the positive control is

326
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:06,539
similar so there are other free DNA

327
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:11,219
removal products out there

328
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:13,569
one is PMA and PMA is a high of affinity

329
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,240
photoreactive DNA in Turkey

330
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,640
by and what that basically means as is

331
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,919
that the dye goes into the

332
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,269
double-stranded DNA and it becomes

333
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:30,250
activated when it's exposed to light

334
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:32,740
he's in my way and this results in a

335
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,750
permanent DNA modification which renders

336
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,490
the DNA and soluble and therefore can't

337
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:40,029
be extracted through your standard DNA

338
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:43,060
extraction methods the dye the dye is

339
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:45,939
cell membrane impermeable so that means

340
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:49,089
that it can't get into the cells of live

341
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,950
DNA there's also other enzymatic

342
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,259
treatments out there and they require a

343
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,830
fifteen to thirty minute

344
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:59,679
digestion but they also require a

345
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,139
fifteen minute in the activation step at

346
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,479
95 to 100 degrees C and that

347
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:06,580
inactivation step at such a high

348
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,620
temperature is gonna cause the live

349
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,970
cells to start to lyse and then you're

350
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,250
gonna have a competition happening

351
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,320
between those cells that are starting to

352
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,620
be lysed and the enzyme being

353
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,040
deactivated so these both have have

354
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,289
their faults PMA it requires an

355
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:26,199
incubation in the dark followed by

356
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:29,980
exposure to visible light either through

357
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,310
an LED device or a halogen lamp PMA does

358
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,970
not work equally across all

359
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:36,659
microorganisms and different

360
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,830
microorganisms may require different

361
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:43,990
concentrations of PN ma and different

362
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:48,430
exposure to light and PMA is toxic which

363
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:51,430
creates a biohazard waste stream as for

364
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:53,620
the other enzymatic treatments I the

365
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:55,719
product literature that they claim has

366
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,539
an average signal reduction of two labs

367
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,519
or about six CTS which isn't as good as

368
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:02,319
what I had just showed you and again

369
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,539
what I had just stated before the

370
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,449
heating the sample 1095 for enzyme

371
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:10,859
inactivation will result in the lysis of

372
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:14,500
live organisms so some final thoughts

373
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:15,669
Grim Reaper offers a simple 10 minute 37

374
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,880
C upfront

375
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:21,250
incubation that is non-toxic and easily

376
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,339
devack deactivated without causing harm

377
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:27,250
to viable organisms the result it

378
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:31,179
results in a three to four log or 12 to

379
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:34,480
13 CT reduction signal from free DNA the

380
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,730
method includes an added added positive

381
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,579
control to monitor deactivation of the

382
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,130
enzyme it can be easily added to the

383
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:44,619
current mgc DNA extraction protocol and

384
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,670
provide qPCR results that are void of

385
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:52,359
dead DNA and this can be used to guide

386
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:54,910
sterilization protocols that grows I'd

387
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,619
like to acknowledge our collaborators

388
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,970
that helped us work on this project and

389
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:02,359
of course the team at medicinal genomics

390
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:11,730
anyone have any questions

391
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:11,729
[Applause]

392
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,370
thanks for the talk I actually have a

393
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,720
quick question which might be obvious to

394
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:19,849
folks that are in the industry here but

395
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,220
I was wondering if if it sounded as if

396
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,329
the microorganisms are dead then it's

397
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,190
not a concern anymore

398
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:27,500
but I was just I mean if you had like a

399
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,759
massive mold infestation on the on the

400
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,809
product and then killed it with

401
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,859
radioactivity would there still be

402
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:35,299
toxins and other things associated with

403
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:39,679
it I'm just curious why the distinction

404
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:40,970
between living and dead so it depends if

405
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,640
you had a major

406
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:46,279
Aspergillus contamination which produces

407
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,100
market auction micro toxins then yes I

408
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:52,609
think it would be a concern I'm not sure

409
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:54,949
every state has different rules and

410
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:56,869
their regulations as whether they if

411
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:00,110
they fail can they go back and be remate

412
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:01,729
remediated and tested again I was under

413
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:04,129
the impression that in California it

414
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,069
doesn't matter if it's live or dead but

415
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:09,080
I could be wrong so I think it depends

416
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:11,480
but there are other regulations that do

417
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:14,480
you test for micro toxin testing so if

418
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,529
it was dead and left something behind I

419
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,069
would think it would come up positive

420
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,069
there

421
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,789
yeah those this is a really interesting

422
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:38,599
talk

423
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:40,279
III not working in this field I was a

424
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,549
little confused at first when you

425
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:46,819
describe this as dead DNA isn't it that

426
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:50,180
your test is detecting any free DNA

427
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:52,369
attached to the cells and if for some

428
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,200
reason there was cell lysis that

429
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:56,539
occurred during the preparation of the

430
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:00,259
extract would that skew your numbers

431
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:01,940
yeah it could and we call it so a lot of

432
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:05,329
is it's basically viable verse

433
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:09,200
non-viable so in culture methods you're

434
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:11,059
only detecting living organism cells

435
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,340
that are able to create colonies on your

436
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,049
plate we're in the qPCR it does it

437
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:17,569
doesn't distinguish between the two yeah

438
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:19,779
yeah yeah it's agnostic okay thank you

439
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:19,779
yep

440
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,529
great thanks guys

441
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:28,529
[Applause]
