1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,960
good afternoon I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:10,888
quantity to Kimo mix that that is a

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,798
novel genomic selection platform which

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:16,919
has potential to bring revolution in to

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:19,759
cannabis genomics and breathe variety

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,760
faster and cheaper

7
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:32,789
I'm chief science officer for desti

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,250
bioscience we are based in Edmonton

9
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:38,280
Alberta Canada now we are bringing one

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,308
of the largest center of excellence for

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,820
cannabis genomics this research center

12
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:47,839
and that's cannabis breeding genome

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,149
sequencing snip genotyping and the

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,910
tissue culture clothes will be provided

15
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,910
to the growers to have better

16
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:00,599
consistency as well as yield in their

17
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:03,148
integral we have four divisions in

18

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,610
cannabis based in E Naturals there's

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,920
another another division for developing

31
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:41,989
skincare products using cannabinoids to

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,070
peds and flavonoids to treat specific

33
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:49,489
skincare conditions as well as did reuse

34
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,489
innovative products

35
00:01:54,129 --> 00:02:01,339
the the question comes why we need a

36
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:04,548
genomic selection or why need we need

37
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,350
these new modern technologies for

38
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,640
cannabis we know that cannabis has been

39
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:12,229
used for last thousands of years and

40
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,029
since last hundred years there there

41
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:17,568
have been breeding efforts to breed

42
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:24,769
cannabis and develop varieties if we if

43
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:27,349
we closely look at the history of if we

44
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:30,530
closely look at the history of cannabis

45
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:32,750
breeding last century we see that the

46
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,860
the most of the efforts were done to

47
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,449
breed for THC and recently we see some

48
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,150
efforts we went through thousands of

49
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:43,009
strains and in meta-analysis and I'm

50
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,469
happy that recently there has been some

51
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,568
interest in improving the CBD content in

52
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:50,318
cannabis varieties but most of the

53
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:53,268
efforts were focused towards the THC

54
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,488
based breeding and this happened because

55
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:58,459
the technology was not available and the

56
00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:01,700
breeders we're doing we're dependent on

57
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:05,360
just the impact of cannabis varieties

58
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:08,959
when you envision when we smoke there

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,600
was improvement in yield indoor because

60
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,759
recently the other environmental factors

61
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,400
which are important for cannabis yield

62
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,548
such as co2 concentration and light and

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,400
yield water and nutrients so all these

64
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:25,040
aspects were kind of standardized which

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,019
improved the indoor ill but we don't see

66
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,629
much improvement in the out doriel

67
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:32,120
because of the environmental factors

68
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,669
such as heat stress and disease all

69
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,819
these aspects need genetic improvement

70
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:42,798
and there has not much work being done

71
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:44,959
in that area so overall we see the the

72
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,870
century of cannabis breeding there is

73
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,030
there is a big scope to go into details

74
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,759
of minor cannabinoids and understanding

75
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:57,469
the genetics of minor cannabinoids and

76
00:03:52,759 --> 00:04:00,078
whether as well as terpenes to do to

77
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:01,818
develop better varieties and integrate

78
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,239
all these aspects into the breeding

79
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:04,238
program

80
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,580
so when we talk about genomic selection

81
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:18,400
it's it's very very important to

82
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:21,220
integrate so many physiological genetic

83
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,949
as well as chemical components into it

84
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,140
together to have that comprehensive

85
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:29,709
breeding program have that comprehensive

86
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,379
integrated targeted breeding to achieve

87
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:34,419
the goal of ill improvement on one side

88
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:38,709
but also keep the quality and

89
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:41,470
consistency in the chemo types that that

90
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:44,709
is we are targeting to us

91
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,650
generally in last 3040 years we have

92
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:50,169
talked about this much part of cannabis

93
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:52,679
that I grow and that's that derives the

94
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,420
price and that it was the profit but I

95
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,009
believe that it's the more most

96
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,759
important thing that should be

97
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:02,560
considered is the active pharmaceutical

98
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,339
ingredient that cannabis but has and

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,290
that should be the deciding factor in

100
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,750
terms of productivity as well as well as

101
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,900
profit that we we get from cannabis

102
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:18,730
plant when we talk about this

103
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:21,189
integration the debriding plant the the

104
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,830
phenotype genotype and genotype data so

105
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:26,740
all these aspects are combined together

106
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:29,319
besides the integrated breeding platform

107
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:35,379
that one should use for the for the

108
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:38,620
genomic selection when we talk about

109
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:42,180
what are the important ill contributing

110
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,670
traits then the Dupre breeding that

111
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,670
should be focused mostly on the on the

112
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:51,100
traits such as how we can improve the

113
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,009
root sucia ratio how we can improve the

114
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,200
root biomass when we talk about me

115
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:58,329
another important component that will

116
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,610
push the ill forward is photosynthesis

117
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:03,459
how to improve the photosynthesis

118
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,710
ability is one of the important key

119
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:08,049
factors so when we talk about ill

120
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:09,849
implement all these sources which are

121
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,129
provide carbohydrates which are provide

122
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,590
providing sugars for cannabinoid up in

123
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,319
biosynthesis these are the factors

124
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:21,339
combined together to

125
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:24,430
to decide but in there the the the form

126
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:27,579
formula for the but ill overall we get

127
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,110
the resource use that's the resources

128
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:32,859
that you provide resource use efficiency

129
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:36,430
how efficient the plant is to use these

130
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,970
resources to end into high quality eel

131
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:42,370
as well as the Chima type that's also

132
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,590
one of the important factors so all this

133
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,470
all these factors combined together are

134
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:50,379
very very important when we talk about

135
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,710
breeding targeted breeding towards

136
00:06:50,379 --> 00:07:03,969
improving a specific chemo type or

137
00:06:52,709 --> 00:07:07,569
improving a specific trait if we if we

138
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,520
go into the details of the the genomics

139
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,550
of but in the improvement there are two

140
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:15,310
factors on one side B we can major we

141
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,410
can see are the environmental factors we

142
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,879
talked about the stomatal conductance we

143
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,090
talked about the sunlight that's

144
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,909
required and the nutrients that we

145
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:27,009
provide we can major we can quantify but

146
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,350
on the other side that's the complex

147
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:32,168
part of the genomics of the yield where

148
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,390
we have to take into the consider the

149
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:37,659
expression of genes which are important

150
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:39,668
in flower or reproductive tissue the

151
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,770
genes which are important for meristem

152
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:44,228
maintenance the genes which are

153
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:46,779
important for root development d that's

154
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:49,779
one of the Holy Grails in cannabis

155
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:51,699
research the root biomass Latin root

156
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,459
development the genetics and genomics of

157
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:58,599
it the genes which are important for all

158
00:07:54,459 --> 00:08:00,609
these key traits which define in in in

159
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,100
combination will be environmental

160
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,370
factors so that's that's the area that

161
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,590
will push the cannabis breeding as well

162
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,310
as genomics forward through the genomic

163
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,310
selection reading

164
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:21,118
if we see there are three chemo types

165
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,189
now we see in cannabis really mostly THC

166
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:26,369
dominant intermediate varieties as well

167
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:28,679
as CBD dominant varieties but now we see

168
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:32,639
that there are new products coming with

169
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:36,958
many combination of high THC low CBD

170
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:40,740
high CBD low THC and delta 8 THC delta10

171
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:43,859
CSC so THC v so there are many many more

172
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,720
products are coming in market and all

173
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,389
these aspects as well as all these

174
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,120
cannabinoids need to be considered when

175
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:58,230
we select target for a specific

176
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:00,448
cannabinoid really if we look at

177
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,899
cannabis plant it's a very very complex

178
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:05,698
plant in genetics on one side because

179
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,549
it's die osius and then it's

180
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:10,349
heterozygous to fullest for the fullest

181
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,688
expression of phenotype and chemo type

182
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,180
but on the other side when we go into

183
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:18,299
the details of cannabinoid biosynthesis

184
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:20,250
each cannabinoid is considered needs to

185
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:22,318
be considered separately because it's a

186
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,958
complex combination of many cannabinoids

187
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:30,208
many terpenes working together code go

188
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:33,629
express together to end into a complex

189
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:36,599
phenotype and hematite for a simple

190
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:40,588
example if we talk about the total

191
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,050
cannabinoid we get a kind of normal

192
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:46,410
distribution because we are talking

193
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:50,969
about overall cannabinoid content but if

194
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:52,860
we look at the same trait from a THC

195
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,050
inheritance part of view and CBD

196
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,438
inherent as part of you now there are

197
00:09:55,049 --> 00:10:00,479
two normal distribution curves what I

198
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:03,419
mean to say is when we go into the

199
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,699
individual cannabinoid by synthesis and

200
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:08,250
genetics of it it should be considered

201
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:10,258
separately rather than traditionally

202
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,629
it's considered as total cannabinoid

203
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,610
that we are looking at when we look at

204
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,129
the Kavanagh biosynthesis pathway there

205
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,100
are transcription factors there are acid

206
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,958
synthesis which aim end up into the into

207
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,209
the final carabiner that we can extract

208
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,278
from the plant but the overall by

209
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,929
synthesis pathway for each cannabinoid

210
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,939
is to be considered separately

211
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:37,649
we are talking about the genomic

212
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:39,660
selection model in the in the base team

213
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:41,700
bioscience bioinformatics machine

214
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:45,958
learning platform to establish genomic

215
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:48,509
selection model we have now identified

216
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:56,849
most of the genes in flavonoid

217
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:59,730
biosynthesis pathway and we have also

218
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,370
identified important genes intervene and

219
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:05,550
cannabinoid biosynthesis pathway from

220
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,620
beginning up to the end so these are the

221
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:11,129
important factors for the genomic

222
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,350
selection those are to be considered we

223
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:16,769
also went through genome-wide scanning

224
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,720
and identified the important disease

225
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:25,500
resistance genes in cannabis genome

226
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:28,278
using comparative genomics approach as I

227
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,049
I was mentioning so all these he

228
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:32,700
targeted genes combined together we

229
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:36,149
stand through the cannabis genome here

230
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,190
annotated it and we have more than 4,000

231
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,740
key genes which are important for

232
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:44,670
genomic selection panel we have

233
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,740
identified functionally identified

234
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:48,419
they're annotated functions and we know

235
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,589
the location of the genes and we are

236
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:51,659
working on developing this

237
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:54,420
first-of-its-kind genomic selection

238
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:56,309
panel including the mathematical

239
00:11:54,419 --> 00:12:04,229
modeling that's required for the genomic

240
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:07,319
solution as this this interesting graph

241
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,230
shows so we have annotated genome with a

242
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,778
plan genomics approach we have key genes

243
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,519
important for cannabinoid biosynthesis

244
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:16,320
we have key genes important for

245
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,939
Philippine biosynthesis we have key

246
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,180
genes important for flavonoid

247
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,459
biosynthesis their location and as you

248
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:25,349
can see in another graph the other key

249
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,449
traits such as flowering time genes we

250
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,420
have an ax to annotated all the genes

251
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,790
and identified the snips in these genes

252
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:35,429
which will enable us to develop matica

253
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:38,539
mathematical models as well as the panel

254
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,539
for genomic solution

255
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:50,279
the the resources that require for

256
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:52,240
genomic selections needs the

257
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,459
understanding of bioinformatics

258
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,810
pipelines using them effectively to

259
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:01,600
annotate genes they will snip panels but

260
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:05,049
the real question is why should we do it

261
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,920
what is the importance of using genomic

262
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:12,939
selection because it really helps in

263
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:17,459
terms of taking a whole genome approach

264
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:20,740
at the sequence level and helps to

265
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:23,019
access or hel helps to get back the

266
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,570
missing heritability that we cannot get

267
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:27,549
when we are doing phenotype based

268
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,290
breeding or when we are doing Barker

269
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:32,709
assisted selection based grading where

270
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:35,469
the major genes are considered in terms

271
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:38,139
of qtls but when we do genomic selection

272
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,180
when we use this approach even the minor

273
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:43,149
alleles or minor genes with smaller

274
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:46,299
additive effects are considered and this

275
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:48,610
is one of the best method that's that's

276
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:51,059
the gold standard for cannabis breeding

277
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,060
I believe

278
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,309
and the other important aspect when we

279
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:09,680
talk about genomic selection that is

280
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:12,629
there are multiple traits and we cannot

281
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,549
consider each trait independently we

282
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:17,460
have to consider all these traits ill

283
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:19,259
contributing traits together because in

284
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,259
the end we have to bring all these

285
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,779
traits through breeding and genetics

286
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:28,470
based selection into into the variety

287
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:30,539
that we want to breed and that is where

288
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,899
the the quantitative traits are

289
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:35,879
important for which the prediction

290
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,519
models are built and the coefficient

291
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:41,279
correlation coefficients to be to be

292
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,379
added into all the quantitative traits

293
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,659
or the qualitative traits all the

294
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:49,500
agronomic traits which are important for

295
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:51,809
the for the yield as well as biotic and

296
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,809
abiotic stress when we when we talk

297
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:57,659
about combination of these traits then

298
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:00,929
again when we decide a targeted breeding

299
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:05,490
approach the the the models the genetics

300
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:08,609
and the D combination of the traits and

301
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,990
genes we use changes depending on the

302
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:16,740
targeted traits that is to be achieved

303
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:20,850
the the key important aspect depends the

304
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:23,789
key important aspect which decides the

305
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:28,339
the correlation between what is the

306
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:31,079
predicted phenotype and what is the the

307
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:33,480
expected phenotype depends on how big

308
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,790
your population size is it depends on

309
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,710
the heritability of the trait how many

310
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:41,250
genes are how many QT ELLs are

311
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:45,769
controlling that trait defines the the

312
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:48,299
the success of genomic selection on

313
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:51,710
individual basis as well as on the

314
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:51,709
combination basis together

315
00:15:55,659 --> 00:16:02,419
the the other important aspect when we

316
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:05,090
when we talk about the de genomic

317
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:09,679
selection and the the real advantage we

318
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:14,930
get from genomic selection is we can

319
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:17,719
predict the phenotype before the just

320
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:20,449
based on the genotype and that's where

321
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:24,740
it really it brings revolution into

322
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:29,660
breeding because we can discard so many

323
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:32,769
we can negate so many clones predicted

324
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:36,589
from the genotype and this is enabled

325
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:39,199
then we build robust enough data sets

326
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:42,220
for phenotype genotype and genotype

327
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,320
together which are able to predict the

328
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:49,129
phenotype of the next generation when

329
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:51,590
you when you use this model and that's

330
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:55,460
where the the the predicted selection

331
00:16:51,590 --> 00:17:00,399
index goes are better as as you combine

332
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,400
traits and as you bring them together

333
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:15,629
let's let's look at the three different

334
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:17,879
methods that can be used and has been

335
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:22,890
used the first method we know

336
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,930
traditional breeding method that has

337
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,280
been used and this traditional breeding

338
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:31,460
method depends on phenotype and then

339
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:33,690
chemo type chemo typing that's been done

340
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:37,110
crossing the plants and checking the

341
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,269
pedigree for for genetic improvement and

342
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:42,019
that this has been the standard method

343
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:46,440
that was used last hundred years for

344
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:48,779
cannabis genetic improvement the problem

345
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,269
with this patter although I don't have

346
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,799
doubt that was the only way and it has

347
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:56,220
been successful the problem with this

348
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,099
method is that cannabis plant is very

349
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,039
complex

350
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:03,389
here we are selecting based on the

351
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,889
visual traits here we are selecting

352
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,570
based on the cue motive

353
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:11,610
but when we go into the details of the

354
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:13,649
minor cannabinoids when we go into the

355
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:16,109
details of combination of cannabinoids

356
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:19,920
which can be really good for medicinal

357
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:23,429
formulation development we cannot do it

358
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,710
because it has limitation in terms of

359
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,500
understanding the genetics of it it has

360
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:31,519
limitation in terms of combining traits

361
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,519
together efficiently

362
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:39,350
that's where last hundred years the

363
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,240
breeding was happening but recently with

364
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:45,329
available of availability of genome

365
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,000
sequences and recent discovery of a

366
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:50,669
cannabinoid in biosynthesis genes and

367
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,750
the gene sequence available we have

368
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:56,820
moved a step forward now we have

369
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,069
molecular markers for these traits and

370
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:04,460
these molecular markers can be used for

371
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:09,210
breeding and targeted trait improvement

372
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:11,789
but when we talk about cannabis it's a

373
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:14,220
complex plant and all these biosynthesis

374
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:17,940
pathways are complicated and that's

375
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,798
where even if we use approach

376
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,259
such as cutie elves are such a

377
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:25,829
genome-wide Association studies but

378
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:29,700
still there there is significant missing

379
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:34,109
heritability which is limiting us from

380
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,960
the from using the maximum possible

381
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:40,168
genetic gain that we can get and that is

382
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,769
where the genomic selection helps in

383
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:48,389
terms of bringing all these different

384
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:50,278
aspects of breeding together we make use

385
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:53,758
of all the high-throughput scientific

386
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:58,288
data we can we make use of all the chemo

387
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:00,628
type data and the genome estimated

388
00:19:58,288 --> 00:20:03,298
bleeding value that comes out of genomic

389
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:05,730
selection that's is that's that's one of

390
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:10,099
the missing factor that really pushes

391
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:13,620
forward in terms of getting that missing

392
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:17,730
heritability bring brought back into the

393
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:21,778
breeding program but it also takes it

394
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:24,329
takes into consideration and uses the

395
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:27,509
earlier available qtls which are major

396
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:29,069
genes that that has major impact on the

397
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:32,099
trade as well as the genome-wide

398
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:34,918
Association studies where we can select

399
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:37,369
and use many cutie ELLs together many

400
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:40,860
genomic regions which affect the trait

401
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:43,859
together to bring all these aspects

402
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:45,898
where we use the genome estimated

403
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:48,000
breeding value when we use make use of

404
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:52,558
the cutie ELLs and when we make use of

405
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,869
the the minor alleles identified through

406
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:58,288
genome-wide Association studies combined

407
00:20:54,869 --> 00:21:03,058
together to use this genomic selection

408
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:06,589
panel and that's where I believe the the

409
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:11,638
use of genomics selection panel is is

410
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:14,278
one of the important Holy Grails or one

411
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:19,048
of the important aspects those should be

412
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:23,128
used for cannabis reading and destiny by

413
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:25,710
science using the the pipelines for

414
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:29,148
annotation using the pipelines for snip

415
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,679
genotyping using the pipelines for

416
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:36,268
identifying the functional

417
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:40,679
beautiful functional traits those are

418
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:43,378
controlled by the genes we have put

419
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:46,019
together a very exciting platform and an

420
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:50,158
opportunity that will push forward and

421
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:53,970
make amazing change the way cannabis

422
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,220
breeding used to be then and then who

423
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:59,819
will do the cannabis breeding at a very

424
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:13,649
fast paced manner in a cost-effective

425
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:16,918
way so to to summarize the the cannabis

426
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:20,219
breeding which is complicated now we

427
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:24,149
have opportunity to make use of modern

428
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,009
technology sequencing technologies to

429
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:28,168
integrate into the breeding and that's

430
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:30,419
going to play play major role in

431
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:36,929
cannabis genetic improvement in the

432
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:39,299
future the maximum availability of the

433
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:42,629
genetic diversity that's it that's a key

434
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:45,898
resource there is ample genetic

435
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:49,349
diversity available through through all

436
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:52,729
these heterozygous genetic collections

437
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:55,199
available sequenced and annotated

438
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,450
together for molecular marker

439
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,048
development is is going to be crucial

440
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:03,808
and again it depends on everybody has

441
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:06,528
different collections so the targeted

442
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:09,148
breeding approach and the output that

443
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:11,849
every breeding program will get depends

444
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:14,069
on what is there available in in their

445
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:16,949
genetic resources in their bank for

446
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:23,099
sequencing phenotyping and developing

447
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:25,379
their marker development program the the

448
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:27,449
role of high-throughput phenotyping and

449
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:31,259
humor typing is going to play a major

450
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:34,798
role because having these data sets

451
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:37,230
properly collected annotated analyzed

452
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:41,910
and integrated into the breeding program

453
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:45,220
is crucial for establishing these models

454
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,620
cheemo typing is also one of the key

455
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,750
areas that should be integrated and

456
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:52,659
should work hands in hands with

457
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:55,299
genotyping and genotyping because having

458
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,509
these databases and having access to

459
00:23:55,299 --> 00:24:01,960
minor cannibalize monitor pins analyzed

460
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:05,589
through in-house breeding program will

461
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,829
be important to dissect treat separately

462
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:14,199
and then bring their targeted breeding

463
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:16,000
approach for focusing to us the minor

464
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,160
cannabinoids and focus to us the

465
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,210
terpenes which were not considered

466
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:25,029
earlier seriously and the the medicinal

467
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,789
potential as well as the new

468
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:32,678
opportunities that we can bring through

469
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:35,379
all these minor cannabinoids as I said

470
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:39,809
cannabis genome is very complex so the

471
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:43,600
the genetics of these complex traits

472
00:24:39,808 --> 00:24:45,460
will be elucidated or will be discovered

473
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,759
through this genomic selection platform

474
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,049
where high-density genetic map and

475
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:54,490
mapping populations as well as the

476
00:24:52,049 --> 00:25:00,700
understanding of each cannabinoid

477
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:06,029
biosynthesis gene pathways at individual

478
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:09,400
level definitely enable to even push the

479
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:12,700
the percentage of these - cannabinoids

480
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,519
higher which was which was not possible

481
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:19,080
earlier there is a there is a lot of

482
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,250
scope to to improve the the

483
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,439
concentration of minor cannabinoids

484
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:29,200
through using this genomic selection

485
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:34,450
platform one of the really interesting

486
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:37,330
opportunity that that brings the

487
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:40,210
research and discovery using these type

488
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:43,029
of platforms is the untouched areas such

489
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,039
as improving the photosynthesis

490
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:47,170
improving the root biomass so these

491
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,779
these are the areas actually which will

492
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:52,058
push the ill forward why we see

493
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:55,148
limitation in yield now because we are

494
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:57,908
mostly focusing on improving the THC

495
00:25:55,148 --> 00:26:01,449
our CBD content but we are not focusing

496
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:03,929
to improve upon the basic ill

497
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,609
contributing traits those are required

498
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:09,339
for the ill as well as quality

499
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:11,259
improvement one of the key traits such

500
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:16,088
as improving the photosynthesis

501
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:18,098
efficiency by selecting the genetic

502
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:20,378
variation for light harvest complex

503
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:23,888
selecting the genetic variation for

504
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:26,228
Rubisco activase and phenotyping for all

505
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:28,358
these physiological traits is going to

506
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:30,788
definitely help to improve the yield

507
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:33,548
further irrespective of the genetic

508
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:35,919
variation that we are using as

509
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:39,788
background the another interesting area

510
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,710
I believe we are focusing and should be

511
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:43,749
focused on focused on is root

512
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:47,200
development that's that's one of the key

513
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:50,618
areas where the research and discovery

514
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:55,149
is required for root biomass lateral

515
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:58,148
root development root depth development

516
00:26:55,148 --> 00:27:01,508
and genetics of all these traits it's

517
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:03,308
key to push all these ill contributing

518
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:05,440
traits as well as understanding the

519
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:12,219
complexity of cannabinoid in

520
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:14,619
biosynthesis through expression analysis

521
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:18,070
through genetic variation analysis and

522
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:21,819
through mutant analysis to bring that

523
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:26,319
new wave of genomics assistive breeding

524
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:28,928
into into cannabis research that destiny

525
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,838
bioscience we are heavily focusing on

526
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:34,019
data science and machine learning our

527
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:38,019
approach towards precision breeding

528
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:40,028
because in the end we need platforms

529
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:44,200
which can integrate all these datasets

530
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:46,628
together and then predict the the

531
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,588
algorithms or predict the patterns which

532
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:53,019
we can replicate again and again to add

533
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:59,638
new traits into the into the breeding

534
00:27:53,019 --> 00:28:02,229
varieties so to to to summarize the

535
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:05,500
genomic selection platform that we are

536
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:08,409
developing at destiny bioscience

537
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,759
we'll bring a big revolution into the

538
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:14,500
cannabis breeding targeted breeding and

539
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,369
opportunity to go deep into the

540
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:21,369
discovery research of minor cannabinoids

541
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:23,408
enabling the extraction and purification

542
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:26,829
of all these minor cannabinoids

543
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:41,740
combining together to develop better

544
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:45,329
medicinal formulations thank you hello

545
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,950
Christian associate what are the

546
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:50,439
additional efforts from the breeders

547
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,480
perspective when they engage with you or

548
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,730
in your platform and what are the

549
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,339
additional you know activities or

550
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,750
processes involved or costs maybe for

551
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:01,829
the breeder compared to more traditional

552
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,759
you know a breeding plan selection

553
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:09,339
that's it that's the interesting

554
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:13,000
question the the simple answer is the

555
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:14,678
maximum genetic diversity more the

556
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,159
genetic diversity more there is

557
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:21,400
discovery and stronger the dynamic

558
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,890
selection platform so as more and more

559
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,440
genetic diversity comes into the

560
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,450
breeding program its sequenced and used

561
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,058
for snip genotyping as well as snip

562
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,669
development stronger the genomic

563
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:35,769
selection platform becomes so adding

564
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,830
more diversity collaborating and working

565
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:44,319
together is is one one of the important

566
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:46,750
aspects that we should do great thoughts

567
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,569
so what are you doing in terms of

568
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:52,690
instrumentation for your analysis and

569
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:56,918
then are you doing that analysis at

570
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:58,990
different stages of of growing to you

571
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:05,770
know get that other paradigm in terms of

572
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:09,909
what how may be RNA is connecting to THC

573
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:13,000
V levels at day 30 of the of the growth

574
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:16,030
for example yeah that's a very very

575
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,160
interesting question in in breeding

576
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:21,920
program we look at the genetic very

577
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:26,269
at genome level but we also take into

578
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,160
consideration the transcription the gene

579
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:31,309
expression as well as different isoforms

580
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,640
of the gene to identify right which is

581
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:37,009
the functional copy and which are the

582
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,370
minor copies in combination working for

583
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:42,349
the traits and yes we we take into

584
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:44,809
consideration of expression of different

585
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:47,990
genes at different developmental stage

586
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:50,000
to to identify the perfect expression or

587
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:59,450
perfect stage which is responsible for

588
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:01,819
the final chemo type thank you one more

589
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:05,390
quick question so we say there's a

590
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:07,700
specific cultivar the the market or

591
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:10,130
doctors want and we know that they're

592
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,279
really hard to find say like a THC V

593
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,540
cultivar in NorCal that you know came

594
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,210
out of Harborside or something like that

595
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:20,389
that's already been bred up to thirteen

596
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:23,509
or fourteen percent THC v how long will

597
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:26,390
it take your sort of technology to you

598
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:30,680
know create clones of that then farmers

599
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:33,890
can grow that's a good question so

600
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,110
whatever these new rare cannabinoid

601
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:39,320
strains are available that's it the rate

602
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:42,919
starting resource and then we can

603
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:46,069
improve these starting genetics for

604
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,230
yield and other quality traits or we can

605
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:50,659
breed disease resistance into it which

606
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:54,610
is the real real value to improve this

607
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:57,850
this this variety and make it

608
00:31:54,609 --> 00:32:00,319
commercially successful in terms of

609
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:02,119
growers getting benefit growing from it

610
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,029
because the yield is optimized there is

611
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:08,119
disease resistance so these these traits

612
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:10,329
can be combined together and bred into a

613
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,669
new variety with our genomic selection

614
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:17,049
approach and platform I believe like

615
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:17,050
within within couple of years

616
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,849
thank you
