pharmacists can help cannabis patients

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,400

in cannabis dispensaries and

63
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:58,260

[Music]

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,900
good morning swathi thanks so much for

86
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,279
joining us on the podcast thank you so

87
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,138
much for having me

88
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,719
all right I'm excited to talk with you

89
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,300
today because I believe you are the

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,820
first pharmacist that we've had on the

91
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,978
podcast and well I'm the first that's

92
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,740
amazing yeah and hopefully not the last

93
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:36,599
because I know that you have written and

94
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,759
spoken about the important role that

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,220
pharmacists play in helping patients

96
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,800
navigate their cannabis medicine Journey

97
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,600
but absolutely but before we dig into

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,819
that I was hoping you could tell us a

99
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,340
bit about how you got interested or got

100
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:53,459
started in cannabis medicine

101
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:56,339
yeah so growing up I was around

102
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,859
ayurvedic herbs and so I always was kind

103
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,019
of in this bridge between the

104
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,720
conventional and unconventional you know

105
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:05,758
and the the east meets west so was

106
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,740
always very interested in the

107
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,220
preventative side of healing and really

108
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,680
how we can work with prescriptions and

109
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,160
whether that's in conjunction

110
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,840
um if we add herbs if we add any other

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,880
healing modalities whether it be

112
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,659
nutrition or you know talking about

113
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:27,120
sleep hygiene or Homeopathy therapeutic

114
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,340
aromatherapy I was always interested in

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,500
how a healthcare professional could

116
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,599
guide a patient with all these different

117
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,418
modalities that could potentially work

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,600
for someone and so to me when I saw a

119
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:41,579
pharmacist in a pharmacy I saw them you

120
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,100
know standing between the prescriptions

121
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:46,198
and the supplements so going to pharmacy

122
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,960
school I really thought there would be a

123
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,139
wide array of information on all of this

124
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,538
but as some people probably know the

125
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,100
pharmacy curriculum is is very

126
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:58,918
clinically driven very clinically

127
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,500
focused and it's very you know very

128
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:05,219
specific about prescription medications

129
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,279
more than the other side of healing so I

130
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,960
was drawn to how can I be that

131
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,119
Healthcare professional that looks at

132
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,038
both sides that sees the value in both

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,600
sides and so that's how I found

134
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,459
Integrative Health and I found an

135
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,560
incredible Mentor

136
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,299
um out in LA and at the time I was going

137
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,600
to school in South Carolina and I grew

138
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,139
up in the Northeast so I really was just

139
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,020
on a whim I just messaged this appy

140
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,060
preceptor saying you know like what

141
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,219
you're doing is so inspirational I would

142
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,959
love to do a rotation so that's Dr Pam

143
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,020
tarlo I had a chance to do a rotation

144
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,299
with her and just a few two days into

145
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:45,060
the rotation realized wow like this is

146
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,460
absolutely where I fit in Pharmacy this

147
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,620
is what I've been searching for and so I

148
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,339
asked her if there was a way that I

149
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,918
could

150
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:55,318
move to LA after graduation and train

151
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,599
with her and so our conversations from

152
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,160
there kind of evolved and we got to the

153
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,080
point where we were like you know we

154
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,600
should start a postdoctoral residency

155
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,879
training program for pharmacists

156
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,000
interested in pursuing this like you

157
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,519
know unconventional path and so

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,038
um with her we created like the two of

159
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,620
us created this Integrative Health

160
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,120
pharmacy residency program and so I was

161
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,759
the first resident as well as the

162
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,939
co-founder so I was really able to craft

163
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,280
my entire experience and training around

164
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,038
what I really wanted to learn about and

165
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,019
I kept coming back to herbs I kept

166
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,139
coming back to cannabis and I was just

167
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:36,859
so fascinated by it and honestly I I

168
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,840
always say that like the nerdiest people

169
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,060
love cannabis and the endocannabinoid

170
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,239
system because it's this brand new

171
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,280
exciting thing to learn about that

172
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,680
unfortunately we don't get a lot of

173
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,258
information in our whether it's

174
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,680
undergraduate or postgraduate curriculum

175
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,660
so I found that just I just kept coming

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,759
back over and over being like wow

177
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,880
there's so much here there's so much

178
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,098
possibility in the way that cannabis or

179
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,899
other herbs all together can really heal

180
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:09,060
people so

181
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,799
um yeah I did a lot of work in cannabis

182
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,959
during my training and then after that

183
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,598
continued to do a lot of different

184
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,939
educational opportunities and different

185
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,079
education

186
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:21,660
programs whether they were you know

187
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,459
creating online courses or creating

188
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,840
other training programs for other people

189
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,939
so

190
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,739
um yeah I've done a wide array of things

191
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,740
but at the end of the day really what I

192
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,700
think is most important is

193
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,158
patient-centered shared decision making

194
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,039
so that's really putting the patient at

195
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,538
the center of every discussion and as an

196
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:40,918
Integrative Health pharmacist it's

197
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:43,319
really important to me to figure out

198
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:47,338
what the patient's treatment goals are

199
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,160
and then kind of crafting a perfect plan

200
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,500
that works for them and of course a plan

201
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,899
that's going to work to achieve their

202
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,480
overall treatment goals so it's it's

203
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,700
really like this um like conversation

204
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,820
and this like collaboration with the

205
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,800
patient and when you know if let's say a

206
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,560
patient comes to me and says I'm having

207
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,059
issues with insomnia I mean there's so

208
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,338
many different ways we can talk about

209
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:12,119
healing insomnia and I always say you

210
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,800
know

211
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,720
um sleep doesn't just happen at night

212
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,240
and so there's so many things we can do

213
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,980
during the day that can also help with

214
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,959
our quality and quantity of sleep

215
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,000
whether that's you know the utilization

216
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,259
of cannabinoids what are the what

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,539
whether that's talking about sleep

218
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,919
hygiene nutrition

219
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,620
um then a lot of the other modalities

220
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,299
that I mentioned beforehand too so it

221
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,360
really it comes down to what the patient

222
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:39,838
wants and then how I can help them with

223
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,220
my knowledge base being wide and

224
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,080
expansive of all these different

225
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,360
possibilities

226
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,240
excellent and I know that one of the

227
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,399
main roles that pharmacists can play is

228
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,259
helping patients navigate these drug to

229
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,019
drug interactions I was wondering if you

230
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,120
could speak a bit more about that

231
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,320
yeah that's definitely true and

232
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,360
definitely something that's really

233
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,040
important that that I wish more people

234
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,139
talked about and I wish there was more

235
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,480
focus in you know Medical Professional

236
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,838
curriculum on this that you know for

237
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,759
example with cannabis there are certain

238
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,580
drugs that if I see them on a patient

239
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,519
profile they're an automatic red flag to

240
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,800
me and I mean as incredible as cannabis

241
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,060
is there are other really great herbs

242
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,219
that don't have as many drug

243
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:25,859
interactions that maybe could be a

244
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,839
better fit for a patient depending on

245
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,300
their you know specific scenario and

246
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,380
what they want to achieve and so to me

247
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,299
you know there's some you know

248
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,419
anti-convulsant medications like

249
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:39,899
anti-seizure medications like clobazim

250
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:42,539
or valproic acid but those are big red

251
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,458
flags to me and you know there are some

252
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,019
other medications out there that you

253
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,819
know I might have caution with and

254
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,399
that's like a much longer list but those

255
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,860
are two definitely that are red flags

256
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,958
and then another one would be Warfarin

257
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,060
which you might have heard of where from

258
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:01,078
working literally interacts with

259
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:03,059
everything and so it's also one of those

260
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,919
medications if I see a patient I'm not

261
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,539
and I actually just got an email

262
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,240
yesterday

263
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:11,939
from a patient one of the things so I

264
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,079
co-founded a CBD Wellness brand and one

265
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,240
of the things that we offer

266
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:18,000
consultations and we have like an ass

267
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,339
doctor swappy part of the page where

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,039
anyone can message me a question and so

269
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:26,160
I received an email yesterday of someone

270
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,559
asking like oh can I incorporate CBD

271
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,299
into my regimen if so like what what

272
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,819
would you recommend and what dose would

273
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:34,620
you recommend and all that and so then I

274
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,740
had to get more information and the

275
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,419
customer responded back saying you know

276
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,159
this is my drug list that's the first

277
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,159
thing I asked you know people want to

278
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,319
incorporate cannabis or CBD or any herb

279
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,500
can I see your current drug list of the

280
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,620
medications supplements and herbs that

281
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,659
you're taking regularly and so this

282
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,360
person came back and Warfarin was on the

283
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:00,059
list and I unfortunately had to say you

284
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,759
know the Cannabis is not the right

285
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,278
choice for you unfortunately and always

286
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:08,578
the conversation comes down to benefit

287
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,860
versus risk and so if we can optimize

288
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:14,039
the benefit while decreasing the risk

289
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,259
that's always the goal when it comes to

290
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:17,819
incorporating anything new into a

291
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,159
regimen

292
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,420
absolutely and I think that's one of the

293
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,939
things we always have to keep in mind

294
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:26,219
with cannabis is

295
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,920
um you know there are some examples

296
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,620
where it's not necessarily a good fit I

297
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:35,219
mean I I know we like to think that it's

298
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,740
um it's an all upside sort of sort of

299
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,899
option for people because it's a natural

300
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,579
product and everything but you know like

301
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,019
like you just pointed out there are

302
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:44,638
certain people who are on certain

303
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,860
medications that it's just not going to

304
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,019
work for them

305
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,700
it's one of the myths that I said debunk

306
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,500
that just because it's a natural product

307
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,839
doesn't mean that it's safe for everyone

308
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,339
I mean like a lot of mushrooms are

309
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,779
poisonous and those are naturally

310
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,420
occurring as well so it doesn't

311
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:03,778
necessarily mean that everything in

312
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:05,719
nature is going to necessarily

313
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:09,000
um be like a safe option for everyone

314
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,800
right and and

315
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,679
there's usually some pushback from the

316
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,359
industry when when we point out that

317
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,219
there are you know some potential

318
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,659
dangers just because

319
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,820
you know

320
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,919
prohibition is still on the minds of

321
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,800
everyone and you know any sort of bad

322
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,699
news about cannabis is is taken

323
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,799
um

324
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,379
taken poorly but I think we need to have

325
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,379
an adult conversation about it and uh

326
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,179
just make sure people know that proceed

327
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:38,159
with caution in some in some instances

328
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:39,299
so

329
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,578
um I was wondering if you could talk a

330
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:43,799
bit more about how how patients can sort

331
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,179
of access pharmacists because I know

332
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,399
that you know a lot of people myself

333
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,199
included the the

334
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,820
rare times that we interact with

335
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,860
pharmacists is just when we pick up a

336
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,019
prescription from CVS and and they ask

337
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,639
if we have any questions and we

338
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,740
typically just say no and grab our

339
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,620
prescription but how how can we better

340
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,879
use pharmacists um not just in cannabis

341
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,860
but in general

342
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:09,559
yeah I mean pharmacists are the drug

343
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,560
experts so we're the ones that know the

344
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,320
the most of We're the the people that

345
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,240
should know most about you know what's

346
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,980
going on with the supplements and the

347
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,720
herbs and you know as much as that I

348
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,440
would love for that to be the case it's

349
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,259
not really the case all the time but I

350
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,540
really hope and I want to be a part of

351
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,000
building up a lot of this curriculum for

352
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:35,819
various Healthcare professionals where

353
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,220
if like for example a lot of Brands will

354
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,959
say go ask your doctor or like oh we

355
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,420
can't answer that go ask your doctor but

356
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,159
then the thing that worries me is that a

357
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,620
lot of the quote-unquote doctors or

358
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,539
providers or pharmacists don't know a

359
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,000
lot of this nitty-gritty detail to

360
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:52,620
really help and then you know when it

361
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,198
comes to that then the patient just

362
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,360
feels really lost and not heard and not

363
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,120
seen and that's the last thing we want

364
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,060
is a patient to not get the answers

365
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,639
they're looking for so a lot of the the

366
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,439
root of all of that really is this need

367
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,139
for education

368
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,779
and the need for

369
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:15,000
there to be access to this kind of

370
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,159
information that's evidence-based that's

371
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,799
scientifically driven I always joke that

372
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,899
like right now we're in this like sea of

373
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,958
misinformation right now with cannabis

374
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,240
where everyone is posting about it and I

375
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,879
mean anecdotes are great but we can't

376
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,778
base note scientific decision making on

377
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:36,659
anecdotes so we have to understand that

378
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:39,000
you know who are the experts who are The

379
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:42,120
Trusted sources of information and where

380
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,740
can we find it because once you know

381
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,659
more Healthcare Providers have access

382
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,480
they'll be able to really answer those

383
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:50,698
questions that pharmacists included and

384
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,759
I have to say out of all the questions I

385
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:56,458
received by email or via LinkedIn most

386
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,338
of them are from Pharmacists and they're

387
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:02,638
wanting to know how to answer these

388
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:05,220
questions because truth be told I mean

389
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,299
patients and customers are asking about

390
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,920
it and they don't want to say oh just

391
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,198
don't take it because that's you know

392
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,479
the go-to response a lot of the time for

393
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,838
providers is because you know they're

394
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,579
optimizing benefit versus risk and so to

395
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,320
them if they don't know that there could

396
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,958
be a potential benefit they just want to

397
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,760
decrease the risk so then their go-to

398
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,518
response would be like oh don't take it

399
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,458
and I've I'm seeing more and more people

400
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,198
messaging me asking you know like these

401
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,359
number of patients keep coming to me and

402
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,419
asking me about CBD and whether they can

403
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,399
use it for you know pain or to improve

404
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:43,799
their Sleep Quality this fat and the

405
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,679
other and they want to know how to

406
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,659
answer and they want to know that they

407
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:51,239
can be a trusted source of information

408
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,159
for their patient which honestly is very

409
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,259
inspiring that these Healthcare

410
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,259
Providers are out there interacting with

411
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:00,120
people daily and they want to be able to

412
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,459
provide that information so they're

413
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,380
looking online and trying to find people

414
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,119
that they can message that they trust to

415
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,640
get this info so

416
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,519
the fact that there are people messaging

417
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,259
about it really means that there is this

418
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:18,000
need for widespread education to help

419
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:19,619
providers that can thereby help the

420
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,779
patients

421
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:24,899
yeah and I imagine it must be difficult

422
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:27,418
too with with cannabis medicine in

423
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,419
particular because the endocannabinoid

424
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:32,940
system it's you know involved in almost

425
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,679
every system in the human body so you

426
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,660
have to imagine that there is going to

427
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,259
be some interaction with with any

428
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:43,380
medication that you're on right

429
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,359
right and so back to the education part

430
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,100
and you know maybe sort of some of the

431
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,859
lack of information part how much of

432
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:52,259
that is that there's just not enough

433
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:54,058
information out there about some of

434
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:56,700
these drug to drug interactions just

435
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,558
because I mean cannabis is so new and

436
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,720
the studies just haven't been done

437
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,619
so partially yes

438
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,620
um it's some of it is

439
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,799
more than any

440
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:09,599
like this there needs to be an overall

441
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,519
understanding of the way that cannabis

442
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,159
works in the body and like for example

443
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,960
the way it's metabolized in the body and

444
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,240
if we understand that you know CBD and

445
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,880
THC are metabolized by the Sip 450

446
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,660
system so this is an enzyme system in

447
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,460
the body that really does metabolize the

448
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,500
majority of medications on the market

449
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,259
medications meaning prescription options

450
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,000
on the market then that means that there

451
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,940
is a possibility that there could be

452
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,279
interactions and so even if there aren't

453
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,380
studies okay at this point there are

454
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,379
some but there are not an extensive

455
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,780
amount we need to just look at

456
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,900
how cannabis actually works in the body

457
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:50,879
and so if we understand how they're

458
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,798
metabolized AKA how they're broken down

459
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,960
in the body then we can really

460
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,779
understand okay then there could be

461
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,700
potential drug interactions if other

462
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:02,339
medications are metabolized by the same

463
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,140
exact enzymes and I mean this is not

464
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,000
unlike thinking about other drug

465
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,340
interactions so many drug interaction

466
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,019
conversations that you know that I've

467
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,058
had or that I've learned about in school

468
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,400
or in training or afterwards really

469
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:17,399
comes down to what enzymes are

470
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,900
metabolizing these substances and if

471
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,519
their metabolites by the same substance

472
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,280
it's possible one could get in the way

473
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,139
of the other and so at the end of the

474
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,079
day yes studies are great and studies

475
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,960
are the ideal you know benchmark but if

476
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,599
we have a general understanding of how

477
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,120
these things work in the body then then

478
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,000
we can turn to that before looking at

479
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,500
you know very specific pkpd studies for

480
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,980
example

481
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,480
right and now to help sort of patients

482
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,880
avoid some of these drug to drug

483
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,500
interactions like and I don't know what

484
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,179
the legalities are around this or

485
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,679
anything but you know if someone were to

486
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,200
be getting one of those red flag

487
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:58,080
medications from a pharmacy

488
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,720
can or should the pharmacist be asking

489
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,639
if they are using cannabis as a

490
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,880
supplement or

491
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,200
this would be my ideal situation yes I

492
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,760
think that

493
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,580
that's awesome I wish there was a way

494
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,500
that in any pharmacy it would even come

495
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:16,798
up as a flag like on the you know

496
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,599
pharmacist side certain medications will

497
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,119
pop up with like different flags and

498
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,619
warnings and I would love if that was an

499
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,079
option and that was integrated into

500
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,699
their system and then the other side of

501
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,939
that is actually you know kind of like

502
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,360
in the dispensary side and so there are

503
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,160
um some states that do have it mandated

504
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,079
that pharmacists be almost like a

505
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,900
pharmacist in charge of the dispensary

506
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,639
which I think is an incredible model and

507
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,440
I absolutely think that that's the right

508
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,940
way to go and granted these are a lot of

509
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,640
seats where it's not recreationally

510
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,980
legal it's more medically legal but

511
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,759
um there are some states really getting

512
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,400
it right and incorporating pharmacists

513
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:58,619
in every single you know initial patient

514
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,840
consult so like any patient who's new to

515
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:03,239
that dispensary would come with their

516
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,918
med list and be able to talk to a

517
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,099
pharmacist that would in theory be

518
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:11,280
trained on how these drug drug and Drug

519
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:13,019
herb interactions could play a role in

520
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,298
incorporating cannabis into their

521
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,798
regimen which I think is amazing so

522
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:19,079
pharmacists can play a role you know

523
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,779
from a dispensary side on this and then

524
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:24,000
also in like the pharmacy you know

525
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,538
conventional Pharmacy setting as well I

526
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,659
think that this is such a key place

527
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:33,960
where pharmacists could mitigate so much

528
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:36,000
risk or potential risk for people

529
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,519
interested in cannabis and I think that

530
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,519
this is you know because this is not a

531
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:44,460
Mainstay in most places this is why a

532
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,079
lot of people try one CBD product or one

533
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,700
cannabis product and then all of a

534
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,199
sudden are just like nope it doesn't

535
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,179
work I'm don't want to look at it ever

536
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,640
again and they kind of write it off

537
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:56,340
because you know for example maybe they

538
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,919
picked up a CBD oil that's supposed to

539
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,899
be taken under your tongue but they put

540
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,880
it on top of their tongue or they just

541
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:07,019
threw it in a smoothie and didn't feel

542
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,900
any difference so it's like it's so much

543
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:12,720
of this is yes based in education but

544
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,640
but also just the fact that there really

545
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,140
needs to be more widespread discussion

546
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,140
about it

547
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,360
yeah no I think that model of of having

548
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,280
a pharmacist available in the dispensary

549
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,479
yeah I agree with you that's that's

550
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,859
fantastic and in kind of building off

551
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,538
that point about people maybe not

552
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:33,899
knowing how to properly use the product

553
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:36,658
how difficult is it too that of finding

554
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,360
the right dose first cannabinoids and

555
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:44,280
then finding good product consistency as

556
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,658
well I mean this is this is so key so

557
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,240
um what you might have heard before is

558
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,880
people say start low

559
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,980
um go slow all of that you know which I

560
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,260
definitely agree with but I also like to

561
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,079
add at the end stay low because I think

562
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,058
that people maybe think that you know

563
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,859
just like a prescription until you go up

564
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:02,819
it will work better and that might be

565
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:04,259
true

566
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:05,579
um for some people

567
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:07,319
um but it might not necessarily be true

568
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:09,658
for everyone so I think that everyone

569
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,819
has to find their sweet spot and their

570
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,380
you know perfect milligram amount and

571
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:16,200
you'd be surprised some people it might

572
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,539
be really low for people who are you

573
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,100
know users every single day and then for

574
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:22,379
some people it might be really high who

575
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:25,500
are also users every day so it really

576
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,020
depends the person and I think that's a

577
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,480
bit of the struggle in the dosing world

578
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:33,960
for cannabis is because it's not

579
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,419
dependent on you know race or gender or

580
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,279
you know like to an extent it's

581
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:40,799
dependent on body composition but not

582
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,319
really at the end of the day

583
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,538
um and it's just really depends on the

584
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:48,058
person and their like trial and error

585
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:49,558
but I think that that's why Healthcare

586
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,139
professionals being involved in the

587
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:54,480
discussion is so important because if

588
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,880
there is someone in your corner guiding

589
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,460
you and helping you with saying okay

590
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,280
maybe you start with a quarter dropper

591
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,259
of your CBD oil the first day maybe you

592
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,819
take that for a few days you see how you

593
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:07,859
feel I always think it's really

594
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,839
important to keep like a CBD or cannabis

595
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:12,058
Journal so that once you're taking

596
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,079
certain doses then you can write it down

597
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:16,019
and

598
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:18,298
and then you can evaluate and see okay

599
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,038
how did this make me feel did this you

600
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:21,658
know was this enough to make me feel how

601
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:23,339
I want to feel

602
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,100
um and then after that you can you know

603
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:28,079
continually titrate the dose up if you

604
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,639
feel like that's appropriate but I mean

605
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,500
one of the things I love about natural

606
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,080
products and cannabis in particular is

607
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,019
that so many formulations allow for this

608
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,240
sense of patient you know empowerment in

609
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:42,119
their own treatment and they're able to

610
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,640
take as much as they feel like they need

611
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:47,158
that day after going through the

612
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,960
titration process of like okay maybe

613
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,880
this is not the right dose let me take a

614
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,319
little bit more and maybe some days you

615
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,840
wake up and you're like oh I need that

616
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,700
like extra 10 milligrams to make me you

617
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:00,058
know ready for the day or to help Focus

618
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,940
just a little bit more today so

619
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:04,619
um yeah I mean I I definitely think that

620
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,419
that's a part of it

621
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:09,418
yeah great

622
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:11,220
um and so yeah coming back to this whole

623
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:14,038
um lack of training or maybe lack of

624
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,640
knowledge among Healthcare professionals

625
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:16,500
um

626
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,538
first of all were you taught anything

627
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,298
about the endocannabinoid system in your

628
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:24,119
TR in your training and

629
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:25,740
um is that Trend changing our medical

630
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,319
school is beginning to offer more

631
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,019
courses on the ECS

632
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,678
so okay so when I was in school there

633
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:34,200
was

634
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,320
absolutely nothing in my curriculum

635
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,720
about this and honestly it was like

636
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,819
looking back on it now I'm just like wow

637
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,759
what about a lost opportunity to be able

638
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:47,158
to speak to students and even like new

639
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,960
practitioners about this stuff so when I

640
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,520
was in school no Brandon that was a

641
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,340
while ago

642
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:56,220
um but now I see that Trend changing and

643
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:58,259
even for example today I'm speaking um

644
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,659
at a pharmacy school about cannabis

645
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:03,839
medicine so um and it's a lot of what I

646
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:06,120
do now is I I lecture quite often

647
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,339
whether it's to you know a student group

648
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,319
like I lecture quite often at um

649
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:12,839
University of Southern California so I

650
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,639
live between LA and Toronto so I um

651
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,918
lecture there and then

652
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,679
um a lot of lecturing um during coven

653
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,299
went remote so I've had a chance to

654
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,620
um speak at a lot of other universities

655
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:26,759
like today I'm speaking at a university

656
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:28,739
in Ohio but it's of course virtual so

657
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,019
um that's really opened up a lot more

658
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,000
opportunity as well to realize that oh

659
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:34,379
you know we could and all these experts

660
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,159
but we don't need to necessarily fly

661
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,840
them in we can have them over webinar so

662
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,820
I see more and more schools interested

663
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,859
and more and more schools whether and

664
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:46,859
even if it's not just on cannabis on

665
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:48,719
like the idea of like Integrative Health

666
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,519
and integrative Wellness which I think

667
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,038
is really important because cannabis

668
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:55,079
plays an amazing role in that but it's

669
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,759
not everything when it comes to

670
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:59,038
Integrative Health like there's so many

671
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:00,960
other aspects and you know this feeds

672
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,179
into this topic that I love to

673
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,360
mathematics of all these like other

674
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:08,820
potential substances and activities that

675
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:12,538
can influence our endocannabinoid system

676
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:15,119
that are not just you know simply like

677
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:16,619
based on cannabinoids or cannabis so

678
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,839
there's a lot of other things we do in

679
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:21,599
our daily life for example that we don't

680
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:23,699
even think about that is actually

681
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,379
influencing our endocannabinoid system

682
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,240
every day

683
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,820
um one of my favorite examples is

684
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,700
exercise and so this is another one of

685
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:34,139
my like favorite myths to bust that when

686
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,960
everyone's talking about like the

687
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:40,500
endorphin high after working out right

688
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,179
so this came out like decades ago but um

689
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,880
there were a few researchers looking

690
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,320
into the different neurotransmitters

691
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,840
different neurochemicals that are

692
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,058
impacted with working out and so they

693
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:54,359
found that yes like all the way down the

694
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:56,700
biochemical Cascade that endorphins did

695
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,678
increase and then that really caught on

696
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,120
and there was a lot of marketing and you

697
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,940
know now everyone really talks about

698
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:05,699
working out as you know like the direct

699
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,440
benefit or rather one of the direct

700
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,058
benefits of working out is you know this

701
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,919
feeling of endorphins and this like

702
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:12,778
runner's time

703
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,419
um but actually if you look you know

704
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:18,480
earlier in the Cascade a lot of it has

705
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:21,059
to do with the release of anandamide and

706
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,400
anandamide is an endocannabinoid that we

707
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:24,720
you know synthesize on demand in our

708
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,179
body that interacts with the

709
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,319
endocannabinoid system and in particular

710
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:33,538
with CB1 receptor and so this receptor

711
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,099
is the same receptor that you know is

712
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:37,200
you know most closely associated with

713
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:38,879
the central nervous system function so

714
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,179
again like in the spinal cord in the

715
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,278
brain and also the one that THC binds

716
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:47,340
with and has a very high Affinity with

717
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:49,380
and so you know if anandamide is also

718
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:53,399
binding to the CB1 receptor it would

719
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:55,380
make sense that we get these feelings of

720
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,340
euphoria and this or this feeling of

721
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,778
almost being high from working out and

722
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:03,178
um so that's like one of my favorite

723
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:05,278
examples is that Canada Medics are all

724
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:06,480
around us and then things that we do all

725
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:07,919
the time

726
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,960
um but we just don't think about it and

727
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,580
then another you know another way that

728
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,679
it plays a role really is some like

729
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:15,658
spices and in the way that we cook

730
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,538
whether it's eating at home or eating

731
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:20,760
out and you know beta-carioxide is a

732
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:22,319
terpene that is found in a lot of you

733
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,179
know naturally occurring found in a lot

734
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,119
of different plants and spices like for

735
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,460
example black pepper and so beta

736
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,519
Caroline has been shown that it has an

737
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,500
affinity to the CB2 receptor and it's

738
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,058
really interesting because growing up my

739
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,038
mom would make every time I didn't feel

740
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:40,139
well she would make you know this like

741
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:42,599
lentil kind of porridge and it was

742
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,759
lovely and she would always put a lot of

743
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:46,259
black pepper in it because it was you

744
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:47,940
know something that she always had

745
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:49,619
growing up something that she continued

746
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,720
to do and she said you know black pepper

747
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:53,398
will help you and help go through your

748
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,558
immune system kind of the thing and

749
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:57,359
something that I always heard and then

750
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:00,359
now learning about the endocannabinoid

751
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,759
system and have so many things impact it

752
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,439
whether directly or indirectly knowing

753
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,480
that beauty care offline is an active

754
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,759
component and that it interacts with the

755
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,159
CB2 receptor that's most closely

756
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,898
associated with immune function and you

757
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,760
know optimizing immune function it

758
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:17,158
completely makes sense but almost from

759
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,898
like a scientific standpoint versus you

760
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,020
know something I heard so many times

761
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:24,000
growing up and then looking more into

762
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:26,038
herbs and things like black pepper it's

763
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,200
not just that it also interacts with of

764
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:31,079
course a lot of other systems and things

765
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,659
but it's it's incredible to think that

766
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:36,000
without even knowing it and without even

767
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,220
necessarily incorporating cannabinoids

768
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,440
or cannabis into our daily life we're

769
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,798
already improving what's called our

770
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,640
endocannabinoid tone and really that is

771
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:48,538
just the overall functionality of the

772
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,240
endocannabinoids so some and how

773
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:53,940
important that is because there's this

774
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,798
new phenomenon that some people are just

775
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,620
born with what's called endocannabinoid

776
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:00,298
deficiency and it's just the meaning

777
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:02,939
that you know endocannabinoid your

778
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:04,859
endocannabinoid system is not working at

779
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,860
its you know highest most optimal

780
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:11,038
function and so just thinking like okay

781
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:12,778
how can I optimize my system and maybe

782
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,778
for whatever reason if someone's on

783
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:17,819
Warfarin or on other drugs where maybe

784
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:20,099
incorporating cannabis is not the

785
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:22,740
sleepest choice for them there's a lot

786
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:24,719
of other things they can do and so

787
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,359
coming from an integrative perspective

788
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,419
love to talk about how we can make our

789
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,038
endocannabinoid system work best from a

790
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:36,059
cannabinoid perspective but also from

791
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:38,099
like a non-connected perspective

792
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:41,158
yeah great I'm glad you brought up

793
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:42,599
cannabis Medics because I I saw that you

794
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,520
had spoken about that at the Cannabis

795
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,918
science conference and that was a new

796
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,599
word for me I hadn't heard it before so

797
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,220
um it's really interesting and I'm glad

798
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:52,558
you brought that up

799
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,140
and I'm glad that you brought up that

800
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,119
anandamide is actually the compound that

801
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,120
gives you the the runner's high or the

802
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,038
Euphoria after you work out I actually

803
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,979
had a t-shirt made up that's just the

804
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,720
chemical structure of an animide that I

805
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,460
wear to the gym no one knows what it

806
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,899
means but I know what it means it's just

807
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:15,000
for me anyway so but you mentioned that

808
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:16,979
with the canaba memetics there are ways

809
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,500
to kind of improve our endocannabinoid

810
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,000
tone whether it be through exercise or

811
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,740
things that we're eating I'm curious

812
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,640
about the opposite though are there

813
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,798
certain maybe medications or lifestyle

814
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,659
choices that are people make that can

815
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,359
negatively affect their endocannabinoid

816
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:35,278
tone that that we should really avoid

817
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,379
this is a great question I don't think

818
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,240
anyone's ever really asked me this in

819
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,039
this way so

820
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,038
um if we think about the goal of the

821
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,980
overall endocannabinoid system really is

822
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,960
balance and homeostasis so the

823
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,298
endocannabinoid system you know is able

824
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,640
to synthesize these endocannabinoids on

825
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:56,158
demand whenever you know it senses that

826
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,080
things might be out of balance in our

827
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,640
overall body system or in like

828
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,558
particular organ systems or

829
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,960
neurotransmitter systems and it tries to

830
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,480
do what it can to rectify that what

831
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,019
really can get in the way is an excess

832
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,960
of unwanted inflammation and a lot of

833
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:14,700
what homeostasis has to do with is

834
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,340
really regulating the amount of

835
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,140
inflammation in the body and so this is

836
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:21,898
also something that I've started talking

837
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,840
about a little bit more recently

838
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:26,038
um but this term

839
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,379
anti-inflammatory and I see it

840
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:31,319
everywhere and it's just so important to

841
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:34,559
note that our body does need a little

842
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,839
bit of an inflammatory response our body

843
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,119
does need what I like to call a healthy

844
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,099
response to inflammation because you

845
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,959
know if there's pollutants or you know

846
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:44,759
other you know foreign substances things

847
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,159
that we don't want to enter our body or

848
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:50,398
that shouldn't be there then we do want

849
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:53,820
a way for our body to react and our

850
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,879
immune system to fight it off and so

851
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:57,980
we we don't want to you know an

852
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,760
anti-inflammatory effect but

853
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,399
cannabinoids as well as the

854
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:06,778
endocrabinoid system really help to

855
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:09,059
optimize our inflammatory response and

856
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:12,300
really make it healthy and the best it

857
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:15,619
can be and so a lot of what gets in the

858
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,240
way of you know increasing or improving

859
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:20,720
endocannabinoid tone and a lot of what

860
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,878
has to do with endocrabinoid deficiency

861
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,519
has to do with this increased

862
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:28,378
inflammation and it's really interesting

863
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:30,898
now because a lot of research is coming

864
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:32,940
out talking about chronic disease States

865
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:34,679
like you know whether they're you know

866
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,579
cardiovascular disease like heart

867
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:41,338
disease or pulmonary disease or

868
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:42,779
um even things like anxiety depression

869
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:45,358
um and all of these things really having

870
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,800
a root oh as well as diabetes has been

871
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,000
another big one

872
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,099
um about all these you know kind of

873
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,199
chronic disease states that we all deal

874
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,960
with them that so many of us rather deal

875
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,239
with on The Daily that that you know the

876
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,780
the root of a lot of these is

877
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:04,439
inflammation and this unwanted excess of

878
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,859
inflammation and so if we can work with

879
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,260
our endocabinoid system to help improve

880
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:12,239
endocannabinoid tone then you know this

881
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,700
would this would really help and also

882
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,799
stress has a lot to do with inflammation

883
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:19,019
and what type of stress we have in our

884
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,720
life whether that's you know inner

885
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:23,880
stress or like external stressors it

886
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,799
could be a lot of different things

887
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,660
um and so that's another thing that I

888
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,320
love to talk about too is like the role

889
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:32,338
of adaptogens in our life and adaptogens

890
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,039
are

891
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:38,039
herb substances activities that can

892
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:41,338
really help our improve our body's

893
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:43,440
response to stress and overall stressors

894
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:46,259
whether that's external or internal

895
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,440
stressors and a lot of that comes back

896
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,540
to the endocannabinoid system

897
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,420
it all comes back to the endocannabinoid

898
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:56,460
system a lot of it yes

899
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,079
all right swathi so winding down here

900
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,900
