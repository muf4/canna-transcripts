00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,359
the team that puts on on the caned

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,558
conference you may have heard but

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,519
aspergillis has been in the news quite a

11
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:41,000
bit as of late and many in the industry

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,879
are questioning whether it's appropriate

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,280
or necessary to test inhaled cannabis

14
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:50,079
products for pathogenic asilis full

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,000
disclosure we at medicinal genomics sell

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,480
qpcr testing kits designed to detect

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,799
pathogenic aspil on cannabis products we

18
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,718
have also published several resources on

19
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,000
our website that that describe the

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,920
potential harms that can be caused by

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,118
inhaling pathogenic

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,840
asparagus and we cite more than two

23
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:13,200
dozen asilis cases in cannabis

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,040
users we have also recommended that

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,960
states that are considering Cannabis

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,680
Testing regulations adopt pathogenic

27
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:23,319
aspergillis testing not because we sell

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,799
aspergillis kits but because we want to

29
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:27,519
protect

30
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,560
patients by almost any measure cannabis

31
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,078
is one of the most safe and effective

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,680
medic medicin available and in many

33
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:37,000
cases the potential harms that come from

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,159
using cannabis are not caused by the

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,239
plant but rather

36
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,240
contaminants and although cases are rare

37
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,039
the documented cases describing

38
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,919
aspergillosis deaths from contaminated

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,280
cannabis vastly outnumber the published

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,439
clinical risks of any other contaminant

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,799
for which cannabis industry tests there

42
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:00,519
are no documented deaths for cannabis

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,799
derived heavy metal

44
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:07,000
mot toxins pesticides or incorrect

45
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,360
cannabinoid labeling the same cannot be

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,439
said for asilis so that is our position

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,040
but of course we acknowledge that we are

48
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:19,120
biased and we are not experts on

49
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:22,519
pathogenic fungi however our guest today

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,239
is Dr David Denning is a professor of

51
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,039

fungal infections an organization

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,640
dedicated to reducing the worldwide

57
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:44,799
burden of fungal diseases in 2016 he

58
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,799
became the director of the national

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,719
aspergillosis Center in Manchester which

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,800
treats patients with chronic pulmonary

61
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,759
aspergillosis and he also led the

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,680
committee that developed the first CPA

63
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,719
guidelines he chairs the editorial board

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,519
of a website which focuses on

65
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,318
aspergillis and he leads an organization

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,560
which provides education on fungal

67
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:12,119
diseases in short Dr Denning is one of

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,959
the leading authorities on all things

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,719
aspergillis and we asked him many of the

70
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,400
questions that have been debated on

71
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:23,519
social media recently those include

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,879
should cannabis be tested for pathogenic

73
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,879
aspergilus should there be an allowable

74
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,919
limit for pathogenic aspir gilis is

75
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,759
aspergillosis this only a concern for

76
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,559
immunal compromised patients are the

77
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,679
number of aspergillosis cases under

78
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,239
reported how difficult is aspergillosis

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,719
to diagnose and treat how ubiquitous is

80
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,239
aspergilus in the air we breathe and

81
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,639
much

82
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,878

[Music]

112
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,038
good morning Dr Denning thanks so much

113
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,439
for joining us on the

114
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,759
podcast good morning it's it's a

115
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:24,240
pleasure to be here right well I'm I'm

116
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,038
excited to talk with you today um as

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,560
some of our audience may know

118
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,918
aspergillis has been a bit of a Hot

119
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,439
Topic in the cannabis space recently

120
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,839
most notably growers in Oregon recently

121
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,439
petitioned the state to Halt aspila

122
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,599
testing on cannabis products arguing

123
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,478
that the testing was unnecessary

124
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,600
unnecessary and negatively infecting

125
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:48,360
their business we at medicinal genomics

126
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,919
disagree but of course we also

127
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,120
acknowledge that we may be a bit biased

128
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:55,719
which is why I reached out to Dr Denning

129
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,639
to come on the podcast and discuss the

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,720
topic so to get started Dr Denning why

131
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,960
don't you tell the audience a bit about

132
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,840
yourself and your experience studying

133
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,478
asilis and

134
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,318
aspergillosis great um well my

135
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,519
background is in clinical infectious

136
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,199
diseases I trained as a physician in the

137
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,000
UK uh did some postgraduate training in

138
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,240
the UK and then spent three years at

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,720
Stanford uh doing further training in

140
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,439
infectious diseases and microbiology and

141
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,000
have been working in Manchester for over

142
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:31,319
30 years since that

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,598
time um to my research work and a lot of

144
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,039
my clinical work has been on patients

145
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:39,000
with fungal diseases and my area of

146
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:42,120
focus has been on aspergilus and

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,079
aspergillosis infections and for about

148
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,160
10 years up until about three years ago

149
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,800
I led the UK's National aspergillosis

150
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,080
Center and we received patients about

151
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,960
300 patients a year from all over the UK

152
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:58,399
with difficult complex ASP cases uh and

153
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,079
and disease

154
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,679
problems

155
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,680
great so what is it about Aspirus why

156
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,918
did you choose to focus on

157
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:14,038
that it's a very remarkable organism

158
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:17,240
aspis because um while it's present all

159
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,560
over the world and in almost every

160
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,400
breath of air that you breathe in there

161
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,280
are certain species that cause disease

162
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:29,638
and not most of them don't and there are

163
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:32,478
also um different types of disase disas

164
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,800
caused by the same organisms so for

165
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,758
example if you have leukemia and you

166
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,439
have a ASP regillus in your lungs or you

167
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,520
breathe in a substantial amount of

168
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,598
Aspirus then you can get what's called

169
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,918
invasive

170
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,519
aspergillosis and that is usually a

171
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:48,439
fatal disease if it's not diagnosed and

172
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,120
treated

173
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:53,478
correctly and because it's a fungus it

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,598
doesn't respond to standard antibiotics

175
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,519
it's important to use antifungal drugs

176
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,680
um other patients at risk for invasive

177
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:04,359
aspergillosis patients who've had a

178
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,038
transplant patients with severe flu who

179
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,598
are on ICU patients with severe coid on

180
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,800
ICU and people taking

181
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,319
steroids um so any imun compromised

182
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,038
group of patients really are at risk uh

183
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,439
and at different levels of risk um so

184
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,079
the the other groups of patients that

185
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:27,038
get aspergillosis infections are people

186
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:29,918
with severe asthma um and aspergillis

187
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,038
and a few other fungi as well make

188
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:35,240
asthma

189
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:37,759
worse so your symptom control is worse

190
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,759
you're more likely to get exacerbations

191
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:44,639
more likely to end up in the ER uh if

192
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:47,799
you're exposed to fungus and and that's

193
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,039
a problem so it doesn't affect the those

194
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,319
with just very mild asthma that

195
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,399
occasionally need to use their blue

196
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,720
inhaler you know once a week or what

197
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,958
twice once or twice a day it's the

198
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,000
patients on steroid inhalers who have

199
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,239
had problems with their asthma over the

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,639
years that's the group that are at risk

201
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,959
and then the third group of of patients

202
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:14,159
at risk of those with chronic chest

203
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:16,719
problems uh typically patients with COPD

204
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:20,879
or people with sosis or people who've

205
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,519
had TB in the past and those with

206
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:26,600
bronchiectasis there's a whole list of

207
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,720
long-term chest complications and those

208
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,159
patients can get um worse if exposed to

209
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,399
vasp and it can also cause a very

210
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,360
chronic difficult to treat

211
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,759
infection um that the name for that

212
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,720
infection is chronic pulmonary

213
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:45,399
aspergillosis or CPA and that was what

214
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,839
we specialized in in in Manchester um

215
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,480
but it it occurs all over the world we

216
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,160
just tried to do an estimate of how many

217
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,200
such patients there are in India and we

218
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,039
think there's about one and a half

219
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,560
million people in India with this

220
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:02,278
condition so it's not it's not very rare

221
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:04,639
um it's sort of uncommon I think would

222
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,799
be better to say so so just to summarize

223
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,879
you've got three different types you've

224
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,319
got invasive which is imun compromised

225
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,559
or Critical Care you've got chronic in

226
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,360
these patients with chest disease and

227
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:16,719
you've got allergic which is related to

228
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,519
severe asthma and occasionally cystic

229
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,160
fibrosis as well interesting and

230
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,000
so I'm sure it depends but typically how

231
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:31,000
are these patients becoming exposed to

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,159
the Aspirus in order to this infection

233
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,720
so on a normal um standard day poshing

234
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:40,879
about one's home maybe going to work and

235
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:45,759
in an ordinary office or uh school

236
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:48,200
classroom or you know retail um uh

237
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:51,439
venue we would typically breathe in

238
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,120
between 100 and 2,000 spores of Aspirus

239
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,680
every day that would be a typical

240
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,000
number

241
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:04,078
and unless you have a very severe IM

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,559
immune problems our um normal immune

243
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,838
system

244
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,278
will attach the itself to those spores

245
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,440
and kill them pretty

246
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:17,480
quickly you get some cycling so they

247
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,519
take some time to kill and not all of

248
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,879
them are killed every day but they can

249
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,519
persist for some

250
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:29,039
time um and so that's the normal what

251
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,600
what is a concern is is when you're

252
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:37,480
exposed to many many more Sports than

253
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,680
that so for example if you were to um

254
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,839
dig out your compost heap and spread the

255
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,638
compost on the garden um or you have

256
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,639
bark chippings that you're spreading on

257
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,320
on the garden which have come and

258
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,039
they're a little damp and it's been a

259
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,560
bit and warm and damp you may be exposed

260
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:57,958
to many millions of

261
00:11:53,559 --> 00:12:00,599
spores and those spores can set up

262
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,559
infection for the very first first time

263
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,720
um and cause an overwhelming infection

264
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,439
in the lungs which can lead actually to

265
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,120
like a pneumonia and if that's not

266
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,320
diagnosed then it usually isn't

267
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,919
because you know you when you arrive in

268
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,839
the ER or the doctor's office of

269
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,120
pneumonia the assumption is that it's

270
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,040
bacterial or it might be viral but

271
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,959
rarely do people think about it being

272
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:29,360
fungal um so a big big Spore exposure

273
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,278
causes disease in normal people but

274
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,320
particularly in people who've got

275
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:37,799
chronic chest disease or are imuno

276
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,160
compromised interesting and

277
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:43,240
now so we are exposed to aspir Gillis

278
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,078
throughout our day and for the most part

279
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,839
our immune system can handle

280
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,239
it is there a scenario where you could

281
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,160
be exposed to a good amount of asparagus

282
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,440
that your immune system does clear but

283
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,799
sort of in the interim you are

284
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,959
experiencing some system some symptoms

285
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:03,278
whether it be a istent cough or you know

286
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,879
something that you might otherwise

287
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,958
attribute to like you said before um a

288
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,639
virus or something like that is that

289
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,679
reasonable to assum yes so some people

290
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,759
will get a

291
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:20,198
temporary problem I remember a husband

292
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:22,799
wife pair who bought a new house and it

293
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:25,000
before they got into it it got very very

294
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,000
damp and the wallpaper that was there

295
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,440
was moldy and they stripped it all off

296
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
in two days both of them ended up in

297
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,560
hospital for several days and um and

298
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,559
there was just fungus everywhere and it

299
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:41,278
wasn't just aspell probably it was loads

300
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:43,239
of fungi I think so you can get that and

301
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,519
they both recovered one of them went on

302
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,198
to get some long-term chronic problems

303
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,320
in the chest the other one fully

304
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:54,758
recovered um so your scenario that you

305
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,120
paint is is possible um but of course it

306
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,159
carries some risk because of the

307
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,078
uncertainty about making a diagnosis

308
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,838
treatment and actually the labeling of

309
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,679
the disease is actually quite difficult

310
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,800
in that context as

311
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,559
well right and that's and that's a great

312
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,599
Point too in in reviewing some of the

313
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,399
materials that that you've produced and

314
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,959
some of the videos that it does seem

315
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,159
that there is a difficulty in

316
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:21,159
identifying diagnosing and even tracking

317
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,719
cases of aspergillosis is that fair to

318
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:26,078
say yes that's true so there's lots of

319
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,759
reasons for that the first is that not

320
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:31,278
everybody produces some fleem or sputum

321
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,879
to send to the lab the second is that

322
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,600
the lab doesn't usually do a fungal

323
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,320
culture unless it's

324
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,920
requested fungal cultures are only about

325
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:45,360
30% sensitive so they miss 70% of

326
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:48,319
patients and so we supplement that with

327
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,919
antigen testing which really only works

328
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,399
in leukemia or if you do a

329
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,559
bronchoscopy and in the patients with

330
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,679
chronic disease or Allergic Disease

331
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,758
there's antibody testing so you can do

332
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:05,239
do an IGG antibody or if you have a

333
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:08,000
largic disease IG antibody and they are

334
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,919
helpfully positive but they're not

335
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,799
perfect tests because they're not

336
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,360
perfectly sensitive and perfectly

337
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,719
specific so there are difficulties and

338
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,480
then of course there's Imaging so you

339
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,240
can have an x-ray or a CT scan on the

340
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,560
chest and that can show abnor and will

341
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,360
show abnormalities in in patients with

342
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:30,958
aspergillosis but again they may not be

343
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,120
very specific frasers they may represent

344
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,799
other things they sometimes The Chronic

345
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,600
ones look just like TB for example so

346
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:42,359
this disease is often mistaken for TB um

347
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,360
and in Allergic Disease it's more an

348
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,720
Airways infection so there's not very

349
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,399
much on the x-rays it's more an Airways

350
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,480
infection that's causing the in the

351
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:57,120
disease so the diagnosis is tricky and

352
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,720
across the world uh possibly only a

353
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,360
third of patients are actually diag

354
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,560
noosed I mean I don't know the precise

355
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,600
figure because it's a bit unknowable how

356
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:09,039
do you know how many are not diagnosed

357
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,240
right so but it it probably it's you

358
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,958
know somewhere between 20 and 40% are

359
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,198
only are diagnosed across the world of

360
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,479
all the different types of

361
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,838
aspergillosis now is it also difficult

362
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,560
to sort of mine the data that is

363
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,399
produced from from the hospitals or for

364
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,318
the from the healthcare providers like

365
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,559
is there a difference in how it is sort

366
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:30,679
of coded or tracked that makes things

367
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,159
difficult as

368
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,958
well so one part of that is that most

369
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,039
coding only occurs if you end up in

370
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,159
hospital and stay a night in

371
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,679
hospital most of coding doesn't occur

372
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,278
for out patients so a bad asthma attack

373
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,719
which is handled in the doctor's office

374
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,120
with of course of steroids and

375
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,399
antibiotics and so on may not get coded

376
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,919
at all for example so so that's one part

377
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,839
of the Gap in coding it's not completely

378
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:58,039
true because some of the Kaiser units

379
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,040
and some of the other units do document

380
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,639
everything but many only document in

381
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:06,119
patients that's one problem and secondly

382
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:10,318
because of the difficulty in diagnosis a

383
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:12,279
lot of the cases don't actually um uh

384
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,480
hit the radar as it were because they're

385
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,199
just not they're

386
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,120
missed and then because many of these

387
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,480
patients have other problems as well for

388
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,759
example if you have bad COPD related to

389
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,519
smoking or uh occupational exposure and

390
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,879
you end up in hospital with an

391
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,440
exacerbation and you're unwell it all be

392
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,880
down to the COPD in the accuration and

393
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,000
aspis will be down at the bottom end of

394
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,960
the corner if it's mentioned at

395
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,240
all and whereas that might have been and

396
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,360
often is the driver for that

397
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,038
exacerbation um so there are lots of

398
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,159
reasons why coding isn't perfect and

399
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,640
you're quite right to point it

400
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,798
out okay and now forgive me if this puts

401
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,120
you a bit on the spot but so one of the

402
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,960
main arguments that the Oregon cannabis

403
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,558
Growers have used to resist ASP regillus

404
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,400
testing is that the state was not able

405
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:09,000
to produce a case of aspergillosis

406
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,720
caused by contaminated cannabis now

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,079
given what you know about the difficulty

408
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,839
of tracking diagnosing

409
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:19,158
aspergilus um is that necessarily a

410
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:23,439
surprise to you and is it reasonable to

411
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:25,520
assume that there could be unreported

412
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,159
cases yes it's reasonable to assume

413
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,879
they're unreported

414
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:33,000
cases and it's not a surprise to me

415
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,600
because most doctors wouldn't report an

416
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,960
exposure like that

417
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:43,240
also because it's not the only place you

418
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,919
get exposure to absolutely pin it on a

419
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,159
joint that you spoke three weeks ago or

420
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,080
two weeks ago or even yesterday is not

421
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,440
always obvious so to the cause and

422
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,038
effect piece so if you can imagine

423
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,880
writing a an article for a newspaper and

424
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,720
trying to make that cake

425
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,440
the editor is probably going to say well

426
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,919
we just don't believe it you know

427
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,159
because we there's lots of other ways

428
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,880
you can catch it so the cause and effect

429
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:13,000
is difficult to prove as well in in many

430
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:18,039
instances so the cautions

431
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,079
about uh smoking cannabis um should

432
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:23,158
probably relate to people who have

433
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:24,519
anything wrong with their chest or any

434
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,720
immune

435
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,839
dysfunction so the majority of people

436
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,798
probably isn't going to affect them

437
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,359
that's the reality of it unless you

438
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:37,798
smoke quite excessively large amounts or

439
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:39,879
it's incredibly moldy weed so some of a

440
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:41,319
bit like these houses that we you know

441
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,400
people talk about black molding houses

442
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:47,918
and all that you know if it's super

443
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,640
moldy that's not a good idea um but if

444
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,280
it's just a standard bit of weed and

445
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,120
you're completely healthy and you have a

446
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,960
joint or two joints or something

447
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,879
probably that risk is pretty low it's

448
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,840
not zero actually it's you know because

449
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,240
there's no nothing in life that's zero

450
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,199
risk but it's a low risk um however

451
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,960
there are a lot of people out there

452
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,360
who've got

453
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,600
cancer semic cured but their immune

454
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:17,599
systems are not right got bad chests

455
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:20,639
asthma very common in many many groups

456
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,519
um and people with undiagnosed things so

457
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,320
there are some genetic disorders which

458
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,839
lead to

459
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,960
aspergillosis and one of the first cases

460
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:32,319
reported linked to cannabis was unveiled

461
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,038
that that genetic disorder this young

462
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:38,599
lad wasn't able to fight off asilis

463
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,879
smoked a joint and ended up with a new

464
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:43,439
diagnosis of a genetic disorder showing

465
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,320
that he couldn't handle aspila so so

466
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,240
there are risks even in apparently

467
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,759
normal people although they they're

468
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,880
small as I as I point

469
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,240
out probably the big deal here is two

470
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,440
things one of them is it's that

471
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,440
fumigatus aspir fumigatus is the most

472
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:05,000
pathogenic of them so other species of

473
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,919
aspas are less important flavors is

474
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,480
somewhat important niga somewhat

475
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:13,159
important possibly terus but there's

476
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,120
about 300 other species out there then

477
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,320
they're very very very rarely caus toas

478
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,239
so it's fumigator is the Big Driver for

479
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:22,918
this that's the first thing to to say

480
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,960
but of course if you're looking at a a

481
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,520
cigarette or a bit of weed or something

482
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,600
you're not going to know whether what

483
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,639
the species of fungus on there is

484
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:34,079
uh and so knowing that is probably is

485
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,919
helpful and the second is the is the

486
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:42,558
amount so and many people smoke without

487
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:44,640
a filter so you get uh the spores um may

488
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,240
be drawn in so the end of the cigarette

489
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,679
is hot where you've lit it but the rest

490
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,278
of the cigarette is not so hot and the

491
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,919
spores of aspir fumigators is incredibly

492
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:56,200
heat resistant so it can survive up to

493
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,600
70 degrees

494
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,759
C um

495
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:05,399
and uh and grows up to about 50 degrees

496
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:08,240
so it isn't going to be healed by the

497
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,720
passage of hot smoke coming down the

498
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,240
cigarette and and if there are spes in

499
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,360
the rest of the cigarette then those

500
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,278
will get

501
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:19,038
inhaled

502
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:22,480
um but it's about quantity so if in that

503
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,679
cigarette there's 10 spores or 500

504
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,759
spores of ASP that's probably not going

505
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:31,000
to be very serious but if there's 10,000

506
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:34,038
spores or 100,000 spores and there might

507
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,759
easily be if that mold is if the if the

508
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:42,038
marijuana is wet or damp um then that's

509
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:45,960
a big that's a big dose um and if you

510
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:47,879
only take one if you share a um um a

511
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,319
joint with somebody and you only take

512
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,039
one um breath in with it that's going to

513
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,678
be lower risk than if you you know you

514
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:58,759
make a big big joint and you have three

515
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,960
of them so so there's a quantity effect

516
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:05,079
here as well as uh so the species is a

517
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,360
quantity and and the quality of the

518
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,918
actual Mo the of the of the weed that's

519
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,479
being

520
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,080
smoked no and that's that's actually a

521
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,960
very interesting point because the

522
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,720
regulations in Oregon and in a lot of

523
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,640
States as well the limit is one cfu per

524
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,159
gram so essentially what they're looking

525
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,480
for is that one gram of the Cannabis

526
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,039
batch should be completely devoid of any

527
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,079
pathogen

528
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:37,119
aspil the ones you named flavis fumatus

529
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:38,240
terus Niger um so with that in mind is

530
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,079
that

531
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,759
an is that an overly conservative amount

532
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,519
should there be a higher allowable limit

533
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:51,079
in your opinion yes I I think that is

534
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,558
too stringent for this problem because I

535
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:56,278
don't know how much joint ways you can

536
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,240
tell me but you know if it's 60 gr or 50

537
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:01,679
grams or something like that that's only

538
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,839
five fif you know 50 spores that's a

539
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:09,200
very low number of spores so I think it

540
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:11,519
would be okay to do two things one of

541
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,600
them is to raise that limit so maybe

542
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,278
it's 20 spores per gram or 10 spores per

543
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:19,240
gram somewhere in that range so quite a

544
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:22,720
lot higher than one gram and secondly to

545
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,240
put a warning on about not smoking if

546
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,319
you have any imuno compromising effects

547
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,720
if you have asthma or you have chest

548
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:32,839
disease

549
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,798
um and if if those two things probably

550
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,599
would mean that the the number of people

551
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:40,119
who would get ill from aspose would be

552
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,398
very very very small

553
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:46,558
indeed um I do want to quickly come back

554
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,798
to the the issue of imuno compromised um

555
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,480
because I think you know we had talked

556
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:52,759
about cancer patients and folks with

557
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,319
sort of chronic disease um they they are

558
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:57,398
certainly imuno compromised but there is

559
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:00,038
some literature talking about that you

560
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:03,599
know even if you have influenza or

561
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:06,038
perhaps coid 19 you could be quote

562
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,678
unquote imuno compromised and therefore

563
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:13,558
maybe more susceptible to an infection

564
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:17,038
from aspergilus is that is that correct

565
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:20,278
that's correct so those two viruses and

566
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:23,640
there's another one in um Korea and

567
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:26,679
China which greatly increase the risk of

568
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:31,399
getting life-threatening invasive

569
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,679
asilos so in the coid uh outbreak this

570
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:36,798
was really well demonstrated so that if

571
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,840
you ended up in intensive care with your

572
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:44,038
coid you you know very breathless on

573
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:46,678
oxygen possibly the tube down um the if

574
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:49,079
you had asilis as well and somewhere

575
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,798
between five and 20% of people got

576
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:55,879
aspergillosis as well uh so it's quite a

577
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:59,639
lot of people um your risk of uh

578
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:03,320
surviving was hared it it Asis doubles

579
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,880
your risk of dying and that's true for

580
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:09,558
influenza as well um there is a slight

581
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,399
difference between them because the risk

582
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:16,200
of getting aspergillosis with influenza

583
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:18,719
is as you go into ICU it seems to be

584
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,840
very very early in the process and so

585
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,240
influenza is definitely

586
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:27,720
altering the um the way that the body

587
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,319
responds to the fungus and it just can't

588
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,558
get rid of it if you have influenza so

589
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,398
that would be another warning on the

590
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:35,879
pack is if you have a viral infection do

591
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:39,239
not smoke that would be a very helpful

592
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,919
piece that could be added um with coid

593
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,359
it seems to be a bit later in ICU so

594
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,880
people who get it tend to be have been

595
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,278
in ICU for a week or so before they get

596
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,799
aspergillosis and that's probably partly

597
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:56,159
because they're given steroids as part

598
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:58,200
of the treatment for coid and which is

599
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,880
helpful for the coid but unhelpful for

600
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,919
ASP regillus so ASP corticosteroids

601
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,440
knock out the immune system so you can't

602
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,080
respond and they make aspirers grow

603
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,679
faster so they have a double whammy um

604
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,519
steroids

605
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,519
and um and so so those you're quite

606
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,480
right to point those those things

607
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,558
out just as if there's a bit of

608
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,599
technical background there a very

609
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,278
careful study was done in seven

610
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,199
intensive care units in Belgium and

611
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:33,240
Holland over five years during Flu

612
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,558
seasons and the background rate of

613
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,038
aspergillosis in their normal ICU

614
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:40,558
patients coming through the door was one

615
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:43,798
in 20 was 5% so that was quite a high

616
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:46,798
rate um but if you had influenza it went

617
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:49,720
up to 19% so it was a four times higher

618
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:53,440
rate and it as I said doubled the

619
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,278
mortality so influenza and ASP are not a

620
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,558
good mix at

621
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:01,398
all interesting

622
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:04,359
so another thing too in talking about

623
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:06,639
the risk of aspergilus as it results to

624
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:08,918
cannabis um so first there there's the

625
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,360
users right who who are actually using

626
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:13,159
the product but then also the farmers as

627
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,119
well is something that that has come up

628
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:19,200
or or the trimmers or or the folks who

629
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:21,719
are sort of processing the actual plants

630
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,558
um risk for them as well as they're

631
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,440
doing that that they could be inhaling

632
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:30,240
sort of these large um amounts of of

633
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,320
bores if if it's not properly U dried

634
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,720
and and processed yes so there is a

635
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:41,519
definite risk that there is we know from

636
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,839
other occupations that um multiple

637
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,720
fungal exposures do lead to lung disease

638
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,879
um it's usually people are doing that

639
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,120
are fairly healthy before they start so

640
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,679
that's a good start um and not everybody

641
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,439
would get sick some people just don't

642
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:59,600
even seem to notice ASP just they get

643
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,519
rid of it fine so it isn't a a risk for

644
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:06,000
everybody but it is a risk for

645
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:07,759
some and so I think um there are a

646
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,798
couple of ways of handling that one of

647
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,960
them is ensuring that the plants are

648
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:13,759
dried as quickly as possible so that

649
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,600
there isn't very much dampness and if

650
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:21,000
there is a flood or there's damp gets

651
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:22,079
into the um Bales and it's a damp thing

652
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,798
they should probably just all be

653
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,319
discarded because there will be masses

654
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:29,200
of asps in in

655
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:31,918
those um and the second thing is that

656
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,038
you can wear masks there are N3 masks

657
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,399
which prevent infection with TB and

658
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:39,079
other things and they would also mostly

659
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,239
prevent infection with ASP gills the

660
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:43,918
problem is wearing a mask for hours on

661
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,200
end is pretty uncomfortable and a lot of

662
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,120
people end up you know they get all

663
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,679
sweaty behind them and and then they end

664
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,558
up moving it around their face because

665
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,640
it's uncomfortable and so it doesn't

666
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,759
work perfectly I think it's fair to say

667
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:02,200
but with with dry plants the risk is

668
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,200
much lower than it is with them

669
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:08,678
plants um so I guess more broadly here

670
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,000
what do you see as the major Rising risk

671
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,759
factor for aspergillosis again this

672
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
might be in general not necessarily

673
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:17,720
related to cannabis but what do you see

674
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,398
as the major Rising risk factor for

675
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:26,240
aspergillosis that researchers should be

676
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:30,798
examining so the

677
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,519
um the the area that's underdeveloped in

678
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,000
research terms and clinical terms is the

679
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,278
patients with

680
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,798
COPD uh who typically are between 50 and

681
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:45,759
75 years old they've usually been

682
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:49,038
smokers but not always um and they're

683
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,440
pretty breathless and the standard of

684
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,000
care for those patients is when you get

685
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,480
an exacerbation you're much more

686
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,200
breathless possibly related to a virus

687
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,519
or a bacterial infection or or or a

688
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,080
chemical exposure in some patients

689
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:05,120
they're given steroids and that those

690
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:05,720
steroids probably increase the risk of

691
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,839
as

692
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,000
asilos so we did an estimation two three

693
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:14,959
years ago now how many people probably

694
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,798
have aspil losis in the context of COPD

695
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,919
and it's in the millions it's a lot of

696
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:22,558
people across the world uh particularly

697
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,080
large group in China because they

698
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,759
there's a lot of smoking in China um but

699
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,678
it's true in other parts of the world as

700
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,119
well and I'm sure it's true in America

701
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,038
and it's quite a difficult diagnosis and

702
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:36,278
it's not always picked up and if the

703
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,679
patients aren't better then you give

704
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:42,759
more steroid and that's bad for this

705
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:44,360
entity so uh I think that's one area and

706
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:49,200
then the other thing that we're going to

707
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:51,558
see as patients with many complex multi-

708
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:56,960
diseases as you we get older we collect

709
00:31:51,558 --> 00:32:00,879
diseases in general um and um so I think

710
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,319
the patients at risk in their 60 plus

711
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,679
who have diabetes who are on a bit of

712
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:07,519
steroid who have a bit of a bad chest a

713
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,080
bit of heart failure a bit of this a bit

714
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,519
of that those patients start to become

715
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,398
at risk as well and if they end up in

716
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:18,679
intensive care then that's the group the

717
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:20,239
5% group that get disease in intensive

718
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,519
care

719
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,960
basically well that's interesting well

720
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:26,599
and it's interesting too I guess in the

721
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,319
context of cannabis where the over 65

722
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:32,398
demographic is the fastest growing uh

723
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:35,398
user base for cannabis so um maybe

724
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,839
something to consider there

725
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:40,278
yes um and one thing I I do want to

726
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,879
Circle back to what we were saying about

727
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:46,798
the farmers and you know repeated

728
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,760
exposure to um to the fungus would that

729
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:53,960
also possibly apply to users like if

730
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:55,879
they are continually using a a product

731
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,798
that is contaminated with sort of low

732
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,278
levels lower LEL levels than we were

733
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:04,119
discussing earlier could sort of that

734
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:07,440
accumulate over time and be a

735
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:10,798
concern I think it's possible yes it

736
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,440
does depend how often it's used and how

737
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:16,480
much Aspirus is there the other there

738
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,080
are other things of course in cannabis

739
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,000
cigarettes it's not just aspergillis

740
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,960
there's cannaboids and other things and

741
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,638
they may have an effect on the lungs as

742
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,880
well uh we know that forar and tobacco

743
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:33,119
is example um and the other thing is

744
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,519
that many people smoke um cannabis

745
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,038
without a

746
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:40,278
filter and that has two things one of

747
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:42,519
them me needs more of that crud ends up

748
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:45,798
in your lungs compared with being

749
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,240
filtered out and it also means that the

750
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:52,679
smoke is much

751
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:55,720
hotter and we we we did see one man who

752
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:58,278
smoked like 20 joints a day I mean he

753
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,919
really you know he was was you know and

754
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:03,079
he's he basically destroyed his lungs

755
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,360
and he had ASP regillus as well but

756
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:08,480
probably it was the heat of the

757
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:10,078
cigarette of the of the joint that

758
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,079
actually did most of the

759
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:16,119
damage difficult to prove you know how

760
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,440
do you prove that not easy um but but I

761
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:20,320
suspect that there there other factors

762
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,159
so it isn't just ASP regillus that can

763
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,240
damage lungs it's these other things as

764
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,878
well right and the damaged lung is going

765
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,878
to be a more

766
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,639
the damaged lung is going to be a more

767
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:38,078
suitable or um a better habitat for the

768
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,639
as to sort of take hold so it may be a

769
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,440
self-perpetuating circle um in a

770
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,639
negative way that's correct

771
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,679
yeah all right so I guess so winding

772
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,079
down here is there one thing that you

773
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,280
wish sort of the general public

774
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,119
understood about aspergilus and

775
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,880
aspergillosis again this doesn't have to

776
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:01,599
necessarily even apply directly to

777
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,960
cannabis sure so I think patients who

778
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,920
have bad

779
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,320
chests um whether it's because of asthma

780
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,079
COPD or some other chest

781
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:16,359
disease when they get ill they should

782
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,720
ask the doctor and probably every doctor

783
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:21,639
they see is it a fungus in my

784
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:24,118
lungs

785
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:26,039
because it's very easy for doctors to

786
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,200
not think about it to not remember about

787
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,000
it and if there reminded then there are

788
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,279
special test that they can order and

789
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,480
they can actually get to the diagnosis

790
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,880
so and often it's thought about by Senor

791
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,838
very experienced doctors they think

792
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,599
about it but you don't always see one of

793
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:44,119
those doctors when you first arrive at

794
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:47,039
ER or in the thing and for a family

795
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,240
doctor asperos is a very rare disease

796
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,199
apparently because they wouldn't make a

797
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,519
diagnosis in Family Practice probably so

798
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,399
they won't think about it very often so

799
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:59,679
I think it's being aware o of it and

800
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,760
alert in doctors to it if you've got any

801
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,199
chest problems particularly ongoing

802
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,359
chronic chest

803
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:09,239
problems excellent and sorry this is

804
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:11,960
going to be a bit out of context so or

805
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:14,399
out of order so I might have to go and

806
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,039
and edit this but we did get a question

807
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,639
from uh someone that I wanted to make

808
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,559
sure that I asked you so cannabis

809
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:24,400
Farmers have expressed concern over the

810
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:26,880
use of fungicides to prevent asparagus

811
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,160
contamination um what could possibly be

812
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,079
the impact of using fungicide um

813
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:38,078
sorry what could the impact of fungicide

814
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:41,800
use be for ail resistant aspergillosis

815
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,640
in cannabis processing or or farmers and

816
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,359
could it possibly be a cannabis

817
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:49,719
farmers's lung in our

818
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:52,480
future so it's a so the issue of

819
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,879
spraying crops with fungicides is a very

820
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,960
important issue because there is a

821
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,160
bystander effect of of um emergence of

822
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,240
resistance to azol in ASP regillus so

823
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,000
the aspil fumigatus isn't really a crop

824
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:10,239
pathogen but it lives in the soil and

825
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,599
when it's warm and moist and there's um

826
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:16,679
degraded plant material it will grow and

827
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,960
so you spray the crops and something

828
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:22,799
like a third of all fungicides used are

829
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,639
azoles around the world and there's the

830
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,119
number of AOL being used in the US in

831
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,159
crops has gone up and up and up in

832
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,358
recent years

833
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,480
so what happens then is you get the

834
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:34,559
emergence of AOL resistance in fumigate

835
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,119
ASP

836
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:39,960
fumigatus and then people breathe in

837
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,838
azal resistant Aspirus and then they

838
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,960
don't respond to oral to the normal and

839
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:49,279
the best therapies the best treatments

840
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,440
for uh asilis are all azol and the only

841
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:57,280
oral treatments are

842
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:59,240
azol so if you have a resistant bug then

843
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,839
you may have to have IV therapy and have

844
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:03,559
it for long periods of time which is

845
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:06,318
very

846
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,358
uncomfortable the current rate of ail

847
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:10,039
resistance in the US in where it's been

848
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:13,960
measured is around

849
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,679
3% in Europe it's around uh between 15

850
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,159
and

851
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:20,279
20% and in Southeast Asia it's between

852
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:25,118
80 and

853
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:28,519
95% so we we are going to see probably

854
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,240
the loss of uh azol as treatment for

855
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:34,358
aspergillosis if we continue to spray

856
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:36,559
the crops with large amounts of of

857
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:38,159
AOL wow and if you don't have that

858
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,599
option as a

859
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,799
treatment you know what do you have you

860
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,920
you have intervenous drugs which are

861
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,720
less effective and obviously need

862
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,240
catheters and nurses to administer and

863
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:57,239
much more expensive and one of them is

864
00:38:52,239 --> 00:39:00,039
much more toxic as well um so it it's

865
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:02,479
it's a big deal losing azol and it was

866
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:04,039
one of the issues we had in our national

867
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,519
Center because patients would develop

868
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:09,079
AOL resistance on aold therapy um

869
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,318
because we gave it for such a long time

870
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:13,519
because they had such difficult disease

871
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:16,800
and then we got really stuck we couldn't

872
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:18,639
really treat them properly so there are

873
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,000
new drugs in development but they

874
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:23,719
haven't arrived yet uh they're probably

875
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,358
about between one and three years away

876
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:30,719
in the US now are there better fungicide

877
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:32,119
treatments that don't use azol that well

878
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,439
yes there are lots of there are lots of

879
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,400
different ones actually there's around

880
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,960
20 that are used and they're often used

881
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,800
in mixtures and and sequential so you

882
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,480
have you know mixture a and then mixture

883
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,200
B and then mixture C and they're sprayed

884
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,119
at 10day intervals at certain points it

885
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,199
depends very much on the crop and and

886
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,519
how it's

887
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:56,679
done um but yes there are about a third

888
00:39:52,519 --> 00:40:00,719
of the um fungicides that are used in uh

889
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:03,559
agriculture are um are not are asol and

890
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,358
two-thirds are not asol a lot of people

891
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:08,119
the term that's used of course in

892
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,920
colloquial language is pesticides but

893
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:13,160
it's actually fungi caused 90% of plant

894
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,039
diseases so it's actually fungicides the

895
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:18,279
biggest issue and then you've got some

896
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,000
weed so there's herbicides and the

897
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,599
pesticides are for the mosquitoes and

898
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,760
the and other um you know insects that

899
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:28,079
eat the crops um but fungicides are the

900
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,480
the major thing that is

901
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,960
sprayed excellent all right Dr Danning

902
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,838
um winding down here I did want to give

903
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,639
you an opportunity

904
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,599
to mention any other resources that

905
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,078
might be of interest to the Watchers and

906
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:45,318
listeners here if they want to learn

907
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,880
more about this topic and also I want to

908
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,800
give you an opportunity to plug any

909
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,960
websites or any anything else that you

910
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,760
would like to share with with the

911
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:58,720
audience so that they can get in touch

912
00:40:52,760 --> 00:41:01,240
with you co so we do run um a website

913
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:04,279
called the aspas website which is ASP

914
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:06,919
gillis. org.uk and there's loads and

915
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:10,560
loads of materials on there including a

916
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,680
short section on um cannabis and um

917
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,799
aspil

918
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,480
Lois um we also run an educational

919
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,119
website primarily for healthc Care

920
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,119
Professionals called fungal

921
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,358
education.org which is in English and in

922
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:27,039
Spanish and that's got a lot of

923
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:31,159
videos um of about the dis dises and

924
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:34,440
diagnostic tests and small numbers on

925
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:37,199
radiology and anybody on antifungal

926
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,519
therapy on both of those websites

927
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,519
there's a link to drug interactions so

928
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,480
one of the problems with AOL and many

929
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:47,039
other drugs is that they interfere with

930
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,719
other drugs so you can look it up

931
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,719
there's a whole section for patients and

932
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:53,598
the normal and the public uh as well as

933
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,598
Healthcare professionals on on drug

934
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,160
interactions so those those may be

935
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,880
helpful for you

936
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:00,920
excellent I will put those in the show

937
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,280
description so people can check that out

938
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,559
so all right so I think we covered a lot

939
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,240
of ground here today and it seems like

940
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:12,039
we've arrived to somewhat of a

941
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:14,479
conclusion that there is a risk for

942
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:18,039
cannabis users maybe certain ones in

943
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,559
certain situations um fair to say and

944
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:22,599
that you know

945
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:25,160
testing is probably prudent but maybe we

946
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,920
need to rethink the uh the

947
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:31,159
limits yes I would agree with that and

948
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,599
and I think you know I don't I know

949
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:35,358
manufacturers don't like to put warnings

950
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:38,079
on cigarettes but um and their products

951
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:41,279
but I I do think um a general

952
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,599
information about um patients at risk

953
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,559
would be

954
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:49,119
helpful excellent well again Dr Denning

955
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:51,359
