1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,439
hello everybody my name is TJ Martin

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,759
and um I'm the VP of research

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,460
development with a company called

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,960
abstracts and I'm here to talk to you

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,920
today about a new class of compounds

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,539
called

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,859
Kennesaw for compounds we've identified

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,840
in cannabis

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,520
before hopping into that I'm going to

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,660
give a brief background as to who is

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,879
abstracts

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
abstracts is a broken up into two

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,559
companies abstracts Tech and abstracts

14
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:33,960
Labs abstracts Tech is our terpene

15
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,058
flavor house and our abstract lab is a

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,980
California licensed hydrocarbon

17
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:39,419
extraction facility the reason it's

18
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,119
important we have both these facilities

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,679
is because with this with our license

20
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,558
facility we're able to not only research

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,600
cannabis in a legal manner but also with

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,820
our flavor house we have the flavor

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,980
expertise to recreate and validate some

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,719
of these analytics we're seeing and so

25
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,159
we wanted to know is what are the

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,280
chemical Origins

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,959
the gassy skunky room on cannabis and

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,399
what are the potential impacts that may

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,399
have on the Cannabis industry

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,040
so why do we care about this consumers

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,659
this is a potentially desirable Roman

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
cannabis could be perceived as a

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,159
potential quality metric and specific

34
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,500
products as well as it may influence

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,140
purchasing decisions

36
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,280
um for so if you're a producer this is

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,900
the importance to you because you're

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,219
looking to potentially increase Federal

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,100
potency

40
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,679
in your flower or even extract products

41
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,899
which then leads to making decisions of

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,479
optimizing your extract products in your

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,180
extract processes but also

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,140
drives those packaging decisions

45
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,380
depending how you package your product

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,359
May influence the retention or loss

47
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,239
thereof of these volatile sulfur

48
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,459
compounds for non-consumers this could

49
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,399
be very undesirable aroma

50
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:56,699
and even consider a potential nuisance

51
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,379
odor and so as for policy makers the

52
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,118
Trump they were tasked with trying to

53
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,699
have Odor Control and reduction

54
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,099
strategies potential Health implications

55
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,379
rather positive or negative and other

56
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,818
zoning implications we really want to

57
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,679
start answering these questions and

58
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:15,299
tackling these problems if we understand

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:18,239
the chemical origins of this aroma

60
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,739
so cannabis as we all know has a ton of

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,340
different flavors around us to it

62
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:26,580
everything from gassy floral spicy

63
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,860
herbal it's skunky even some more exotic

64
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:34,440
new cultivars that have

65
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:36,239
more papaya tropical Berry Citrus Aromas

66
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,979
if we look into how the weight

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,239
distribution of secondary metabolites

68
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,299
and cannabis

69
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,620
how it evolves we have you see

70
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,439
cannabinoids by far the highest weight

71
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,680
percentage and it's currently mostly

72
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,419
thca and as far as cannabis goes Beauty

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,939
breeding practices that's why it's so

74
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,759
high you also have other other compounds

75
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,979
such as flavonoids

76
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,899
fats and waxes and then lastly we were

77
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,238
interested in this which is the aromatic

78
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,680
compounds which breaks into terpenes and

79
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,599
then flavorings

80
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,219
and the reason I just want to show this

81
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:09,959
figure is only to show the wide

82
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,359
diversity of secondary metabolites and

83
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,800
cannabis but also the fact that as you

84
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,540
can see with these flavorants such as

85
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,640
the canisulfur compounds in the bottom

86
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:21,060
it's a very low weight percentage

87
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:24,238
compounds which does present potential

88
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,800
issues with detection limits in gas

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,200
chromatography and other analytical

90
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,599
instrumentation

91
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,219
so traditionally the set of cannabis has

92
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:34,859
always been prescribed to things like

93
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,199
terpenes so when you look at things like

94
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,920
beta miracine it's very fewly like a

95
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:44,098
chemical fuel spicy Woody limone's very

96
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,479
citrusy lemon limey linole is very

97
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,579
floral and sweet

98
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,500
but none of these have the sensory

99
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,640
descriptors of skunk your gassy that we

100
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,639
were looking for and interested in

101
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,939
and so we want to look towards nature

102
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,739
for inspiration

103
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,539
since terpenes really don't give that

104
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,480
specific scent it has to be something

105
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:06,419
else and so we look at other Botanicals

106
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,060
like garlic durian fruit onions as well

107
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,219
as animal species such as skunks and

108
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,640
there are no punching Aromas are coming

109
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,918
from other volatile sulfur compounds led

110
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,839
us to believe in cannabis it's possible

111
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,358
that it's fall it's

112
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,579
pungent skunky gas Aromas are also

113
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,859
coming from

114
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:27,359
sulfur sulfuric compounds

115
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,780
and so

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,699
we had to develop us and use a special

117
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,079
type of gas chromatography equipment

118
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,720
called two-dimensional gas

119
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,819
chromatography or 2D GC

120
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,740
benefit of this over a traditional GC

121
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,360
that you would see in the lab a

122
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,460
traditional Cannabis Testing Lab where a

123
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,319
lot of other testing Labs is it has an

124
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,959
increase in separatory Powers you can

125
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,000
see more compounds as I'll go over in

126
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,599
the next slide this is also equipped

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,860
with three detectors that are analyzing

128
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,660
simultaneously as

129
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,759
compounds are being eluded from the GC

130
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,860
it had a mass spectrometer for

131
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,960
identifying the structure of the

132
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,939
compounds a flame ionization detector

133
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,239
for quantifying and a sulfur

134
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,560
chemyluminescence detector for

135
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,360
quantifying specifically just the sulfur

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
bearing compounds so we can start

137
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,780
looking for those needles in that

138
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,459
Haystack

139
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:20,459
just to kind of give you an idea of the

140
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:23,099
benefit of why we went with 2D GC here

141
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,719
on the left we have what a traditional

142
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,939
one-dimensional chromatogram looks like

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,060
has very well defined Peaks

144
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:32,339
but you only have maybe 20 30 compounds

145
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,079
in that specific chromatogram

146
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,000
now you could

147
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,038
develop this method out further and can

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,478
get better separation but you're still

149
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,418
going to have to deal with Coalition

150
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,639
from similar size compounds whereas when

151
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:46,439
we go into two-dimensional space we're

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,478
able to separate not only by molecular

153
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,279
size but also polarity

154
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,740
by having that second dimension column

155
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,719
which allows us to see now two three

156
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,478
four hundred different compounds in a

157
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,100
single run so as you can see going from

158
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:00,959
a one-dimensional system two-dimensional

159
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,240
system we're able to identify vastly

160
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,439
more compounds and start looking for

161
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,478
what our

162
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,300
these specific flavorants causing that

163
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:12,120
skunky gassy aroma

164
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,038
and now to just demonstrate why using

165
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,019
sulfur chemoluminescence detector was so

166
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,839
important to us you look at the top plot

167
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,819
that's what an SCD looks like you only

168
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,739
see the sulfur band compounds which has

169
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,500
in that specific plot about 10 different

170
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,360
compounds as you look at the bottom we

171
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,279
have hundreds now since they're alluding

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,800
at the exact same time on our system

173
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,659
we're able to Overlay these plots and

174
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,879
start pulling out the exact volatile

175
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,800
sulfur compounds solve those structures

176
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,139
and determine what makes

177
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,560
these specific this strains smell the

178
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,560
way they do

179
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,740
and so what we decided to do is we

180
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,780
procure 13 different samples from the

181
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,699
California Marketplace of varying

182
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:54,179
different ages and different

183
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:56,460
Aromas we we also procured two two

184
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,100
specifically that had zero skunky gas

185
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:02,159
Aroma that was gutabarian Blackjack for

186
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,979
our controls and boccio gelato as well

187
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,919
as other varying OG and Exotics to give

188
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:09,538
it that had that skunky gassy aroma and

189
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,099
we put this through our internal sensory

190
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:13,560
panel and had already rank this from how

191
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,180
pungent and how gassy and skunky this

192
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,220
was perceived so we can start

193
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,199
correlating this and looking for Trends

194
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,620
in our data to identify if there are any

195
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,680
particular compounds of importance

196
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,840
and what we saw was we on top there we

197
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,819
have vachio gelato our most skunky and

198
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,579
gassy as well as Blackjack on the bottom

199
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,598
which is the absence of a skunky gas

200
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,939
aroma

201
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,399
what we found was there was a trend in

202
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,639
Auto sulfur compounds three and five in

203
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,379
particular but also there was a complete

204
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,538
absence almost all the volatile sulfur

205
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,000
compounds except for vsc1 which is

206
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:52,639
dimethyl sulfide and methyl sulfide is

207
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,639
common in a majority of plant species

208
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,918
and just give us we then identified the

209
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,620
structures of these on the most

210
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:04,560
important were three-methyl two butane

211
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,180
one thiol and three-methyl tubutanol

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,439
acetophyllate

213
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,360
these are the ones we saw the greatest

214
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,060
Trends with in the data

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,319
in the most closely relating to the

216
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,939
aromatic

217
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,939
score that everybody was giving

218
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,419
something important to notice is when we

219
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,819
were looking for direct Trends in how

220
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:26,098
things were changing we saw that

221
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,759
parental file or penal more Captain

222
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:32,399
change the most with um

223
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,620
with the organoleptic scores there's a

224
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,360
much more linear trend of that

225
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,158
respirinophile acetate was more so

226
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,800
present when the sample is perceived as

227
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,679
gassy and skunky but when it had a no

228
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,120
gas and no skunky sent to it it was

229
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,859
completely absent

230
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,419
then we looked at terpenes as well to

231
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,639
see if there's any particular trends of

232
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:52,019
terpenes and there really wasn't it was

233
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,580
just kind of all over the board which is

234
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,580
what we were expecting going into this

235
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,179
and something interesting we've been

236
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:01,019
looking into Nick jacombe's group has

237
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,759
been

238
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,459
looking into different cultivars of

239
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,679
cannabis to relate different

240
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:10,259
um major terpenes and what their

241
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,479
potential classifications could be and

242
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,799
we started looking into that papers once

243
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,459
seeing if there's any correlations with

244
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,799
ours and something we noticed is that

245
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:21,359
the terpineline miracine rich cultivars

246
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,458
we've really never seen any of these

247
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,919
canisulfur compounds present these

248
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:28,199
include things like Jack Herer different

249
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,299
Haze types that really just don't have a

250
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,640
skunky gas Aroma and we really don't

251
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,639
understand or know why these terpenly

252
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,120
rich strains lack anesulfur compounds we

253
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,559
just know they do lack it whereas

254
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,019
traveling limonene and miracene pining

255
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,879
rich cultivars like your traditional or

256
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,278
your more modern Exotics as well as your

257
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,620
traditional ogs do have a lot of

258
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:53,360
cannisol for compounds in them

259
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:56,339
so we understand that prenophile

260
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,560
acids that are vital sulfur compounds

261
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,959
are what are the result for result in

262
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,879
this skunky gas Aroma I wanted to know

263
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,979
like well what is this now that we know

264
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,019
this what can we utilize this for other

265
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,480
meaning in the industry

266
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:12,240
and so something we noticed because we

267
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,519
use garlic is that initial inspiration

268
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,580
the volatile sulfur compounds identified

269
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,379
in garlic that same structural family we

270
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,139
saw something very similar in cannabis

271
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,939
in garlic we have allele file you have

272
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:25,980
prenophile on cannabis

273
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,260
where you have Diet allele methyl

274
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,420
sulfide you have prenomethyl sulfide in

275
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,338
cannabis where there's dilial sulfide

276
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,559
and dilial disulfide garlic you have

277
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,480
dipranol sulfide and dipranol disulfide

278
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,278
in cannabis and what's important is

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,720
these garlic Auto sulfur compounds

280
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,820
that's what gives garlic knowledge

281
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,680
flavor and aroma

282
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,740
but also a lot of its potential medical

283
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,539
benefits so begs the question do these

284
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,339
Auto sulfur compounds you've identified

285
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:53,899
in cannabis have some other potential

286
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,899
medical benefits in cannabis

287
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,060
second one to see how do these compounds

288
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:02,639
change as a function of plant growth

289
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,899
do these are these there throughout does

290
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,939
this have an increase during different

291
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,480
stages and how could they potentially

292
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,940
change during hearing and storage and so

293
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,639
we did an in-house green in-house grow

294
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,180
trial using gelato with our cultivation

295
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:21,539
manager uh Mariah and capture this data

296
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,299
and we saw is all the volatile sulfur

297
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:26,578
compounds weren't really detectable

298
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:28,139
until about week seven of flowering and

299
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:30,120
it's important to note we only monitor

300
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,458
during flowering

301
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,500
and then it really didn't start getting

302
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:37,379
a large concentration noticeable amount

303
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,980
until about weeks 10 and 11 which is

304
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:43,919
when we started the drying process

305
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,860
then after from weeks 11 to 12 which is

306
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,860
one week after storage and a traditional

307
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,120
mason jar container you saw huge

308
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,860
decreases in the majority of these

309
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,500
volatile sulfur compounds including

310
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,860
print armor captain

311
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,259
next we want to know is do you detect

312
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,778
these in cannabis extracts

313
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,000
so cannabis extracts tend to have are

314
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:08,700
done using butane hydrocarbons that we

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,539
used here one to see is do these make it

316
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,720
through

317
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,099
what we notice is that all the the vital

318
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,700
sulfur compounds you're looking for in

319
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,040
gelato do make it through we worked with

320
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,860
Mario Guzman also as Mr sherbinsky on

321
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,778
this to see that all of them did make it

322
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,778
through in boccio jello and I see very

323
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,980
gelatos and specifically prenophile

324
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:31,799
acetate

325
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,360
was in the highest concentration of all

326
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,799
the volatile sulfur compounds

327
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,800
specifically in the extracts

328
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,919
next we wanted to take this and find a

329
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,500
way to relate this to a consumer that

330
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,599
wasn't in a scary nomenclature very

331
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,220
cognizant that chemical compounds to

332
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,440
traditional consumers may sound scary

333
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,019
right rental more Captain perennial

334
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,480
thioacetate

335
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:56,639
diparental sulfide these aren't very

336
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,839
consumer friendly terms so to relate

337
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,100
something that means something to a

338
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,019
consumer because they are making

339
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,120
purchasing decisions where they know

340
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,879
this or not at the dispensary level

341
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,278
and so when we took our data from our

342
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,379
same sensory panel we started looking at

343
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,480
the chemical concentrations of these

344
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,700
compounds we're identifying

345
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,759
to see and start if there was a linear

346
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,720
Trend or any type of

347
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,879
consumer Trend you can pull out of this

348
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,000
what we notice is that right around 50

349
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,679
nanograms of these volatile sulfur

350
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,839
compounds we start having and basically

351
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,179
when it starts becoming like a turn-on

352
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,920
effect where it was that skunky gassy

353
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:34,979
Aroma and it really started peaking

354
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,019
around 200 nanograms but what's really

355
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,000
important is that even though the

356
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,339
perception of that skunky Roman may not

357
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,259
get a higher perception at higher

358
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,899
numbers maybe slightly

359
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:47,519
that does then give you potential longer

360
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,980
shelf life because you now have more

361
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,799
volatile sulfur compounds present so as

362
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,920
it's off gas and you start losing those

363
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,120
compounds due to Transportation storage

364
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,099
even how long it takes to sell through

365
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,560
at the dispensary level the product

366
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,180
going to that Final End consumer is

367
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,199
still going to have that Aroma and

368
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,199
flavor that they're looking for

369
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:10,679
some of our ongoing research is we're

370
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,079
still looking at other different

371
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:16,199
cannabis cultivars to understand what

372
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:18,000
makes them smell or different

373
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,160
different flavor notes uniqueness

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,259
looking more into other volatile sulfur

375
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,600
compounds just because we understand

376
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:26,100
what makes gelatos and ogs unique

377
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,680
doesn't mean we understand everything

378
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,240
about this planet right

379
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,919
there's hundreds if not thousand

380
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,839
different cultivars out there and so

381
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,879
we've really wanted to understand what

382
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,519
makes each one unique and so this is

383
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,379
just one example of a different cultivar

384
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,000
known as meat breath as you can see

385
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,360
there's well over a dozen different

386
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,059
compounds some some are known they're in

387
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,800
a normalist mass spec database others

388
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,838
are newly identified or still

389
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:52,979
structurally unknown and a lot of these

390
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,560
challenges are due to the fact that

391
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,720
these are such low concentrations

392
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,299
you can't always necessarily detect them

393
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,240
and it requires other types of

394
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:05,338
techniques to enrich them on your GC

395
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,919
and so in conclusion we've identified a

396
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:10,680
new class of compounds correlating with

397
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,659
that gassy skunkier of cannabis these

398
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,879
are all in super low concentrations but

399
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:16,860
they have big aromatic impacts the

400
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,958
concentration is a round of part per

401
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,659
billion or part per trillion which does

402
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,659
have that issue with detection limits

403
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:26,159
we see an increase in these canisulfur

404
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:28,198
concentrations at the end of flowering

405
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,360
and curing we do see them make it

406
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,039
through into different types of extracts

407
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,959
and some of the future work as we really

408
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,059
understand is what are the potential

409
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:38,278
medical properties of these do they have

410
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,679
any is it good or bad is there any

411
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:43,019
impact on the Entourage effect

412
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:46,198
what is a genetic explanation for why

413
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,459
some cultivars produce these compounds

414
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:50,099
but others don't

415
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:52,919
we see this in a lot of ogs and gelatos

416
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,839
and modern Exotics but not really in any

417
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,240
terpineline rich like hazes and Jack

418
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,980
hairs why is that is there a genetic

419
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,139
reason is it some other reasoning for

420
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,360
why it's not produced and what other

421
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,339
possible canister compounds in cannabis

422
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,980
that we've yet to detect these could

423
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:10,019
have potentially really important

424
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:13,740
impacts for flavor or Aroma but also

425
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:16,679
medical or potential mood enhancement of

426
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:21,120
the experience of cannabis

427
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:23,519

438
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:47,519
on helping develop some methodologies as

439
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:49,799
well as thanks to Josh Del Rosa Josh D

Maya Guzman Mr shabinsky from the

441
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,578
Cannabis industry for really helping get

442
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:56,519
us some of those iconic cultivars that

443
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:59,958
are important for the skunky gas aroma

444
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,959
and with that I'll take any questions

445
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:08,640
thank you so much it's actually very

446
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,338
interesting to to to hear that it is not

447
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,319
all about terpenes and files and it's

448
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:15,958
quite contradict to what widely is

449
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:18,619
believed so amazing work you briefly

450
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,120
mentioned about the genetic

451
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:22,918
mechanisms or genes are controlling this

452
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,379
kind of and probably are going to work

453
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,839
on that could you please uh if there is

454
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,179
any work that you have done or any idea

455
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,339
of how

456
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:34,019
genetically these specific Aromas might

457
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:36,418
be controlled thank you

458
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:38,400
yet with genetically understanding that

459
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,700
I we really don't know right we know

460
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,679
that certain cultivars that are rich in

461
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,200
miracine beta crawling limonene pinings

462
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,240
do produce these cannosulfur compounds

463
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,940
so that's things like think of any type

464
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,000
of Exotics wedding cake gelatos runts

465
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,880
Skittles that's classic ogs all produce

466
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,119
canisol for compounds but traditional

467
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,679
hazes Jack hairs and those almost like

468
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,439
those traditional sativas to be honest

469
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,700
really don't produce it and we don't do

470
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,620
a lot of genomic well we don't do any

471
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,720
genomics work I know medicinal genomics

472
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,699
obviously does that but we focus a lot

473
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,900
on understanding the volatile secondary

474
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,640
metabolites

475
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,620
I would love to understand it and that's

476
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,200
one things we hope to find out through

477
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:22,139
collaboration someday

478
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,058
sure following on from that I think the

479
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,538
key here probably has to do with the

480
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:29,399
ecological role uh they're not there for

481
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:32,538
our enjoyment

482
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,400
um so you know perhaps an ecologist

483
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:38,279
would have insight into why the plant

484
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,440
produces these and may also provide

485
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,200
insight into what role they could have

486
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,720
for consumers

487
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,580
totally agree ever all these secondary

488
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,460
metabolites are produced for usually

489
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:52,918
some biological function other right

490
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,840
um maybe some for pestatorians maybe

491
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,820
other benefits it could be even a

492
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,058
decomposition product due to some other

493
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:02,639
process right like in hops we see their

494
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,319
poly functional Files come from the

495
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,700
degradation of different amino acids

496
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,319
like cysteine

497
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,419
that's a possibility here it's a very

498
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,740
reasonable possibility I would agree

499
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,700
with that

500
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,700
sure very good thanks
