[Music]

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:21,839
is total abstinence from THC a a

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:24,079
solution I would say it is the textbook

4
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:28,679
solution um

5
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:31,118
how in your experience um with

6
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:33,359
abstinence uh

7
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,840
how do you people

8
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,519
do can be difficult leave some to be

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,879
desired right uh Megan Have You Ever

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Seen I'm sure you've seen patients go

11
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,839
abstinent but have you ever seen anybody

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,719
you know not go abstinent um I mean all

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,640
the time people continue to to use often

14
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,079
not believing their diagnosis that's

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,359
right right or that they feel like they

16
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,239
can still continue to use low amounts

17
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:05,359
and manage their symtoms that way um but

18
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:08,359
for the like that is interestingly like

19
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,840
one of the only published criteria for

20
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,640
CHS is you know that symptoms if your

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,200
symptoms go away after six months of

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,359
abstinence then it's likely that you had

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,400
CHS six months ago so um but it is you

24
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,519
know if it's like the the presumed cause

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,520
then taking away the cause is likely

26
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,399
going to be the solution and I think

27
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,920
that for some reason that pisses a lot

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,040
of people off like we're actually

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,280
getting at the root cause of this and

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,159
they're like there's no cure for it well

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,320
you take away the cause of

32
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,880
it which is uh that's an interesting you

33
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:49,798
know Paradigm that I see um but but yeah

34
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:52,679
it's um that really is the only the only

35
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,320
known thing to help with CHS and it's

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,240
recovery is a roller coaster it's not

37
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,839
like you stop using and then your

38
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:03,319
symptoms go away and you know stopping

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:06,000
use can then trigger episodes down the

40
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,038
line and um and people are using their

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,080
cannabis to stop an episode from

42
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,559
happening and then they stop using and

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,840
then it triggers an episode or they have

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,680
stopped using for a couple of months and

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,680
then they e some food that triggers them

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,640
or alcohol or stressful event triggers a

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,719
CHS episode and they haven't used in

48
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,679
three months so recover now they don't

49
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,919
think they have CHS right right because

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,480
this disregulation or this imbalance

51
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,000
bance sort of lingers in our system for

52
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,159
an extended period of time patients

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,959
sometimes reporting 12 months before

54
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,039
they feel whole again from a GI

55
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,039
perspective the damage and the the

56
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,639
inflammation that went on during their

57
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,359
EP and you remember people suffered for

58
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,559
years without knowing right there are

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,040
people on these discussion boards that

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,519
suffered for 15 years with a condition

61
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,280
they'd seen every doctor no one knew

62
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,239
what it was right and they've been

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,199
taking medicine and had all the Scopes

64
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,840
and done everything um but the where did

65
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:05,919
I how did I get on this point Megan um

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,319
don't remember you just talking recovery

67
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,878
recovery being a roller coaster right so

68
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:14,318
so what I always counsel my patients on

69
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,039
is like you know we like patient

70
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,759
yesterday hadn't consumed cannabis in

71
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,479
nine days and she was in the middle of

72
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:23,158
an episode and it was triggered you know

73
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:25,798
at Disneyland from uh a hot burrito a

74
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:28,120
beia taco or something of this effect

75
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,560
right and that's what set her off into

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,519
into this this problem so so we don't

77
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,120
you know um we don't

78
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,280
fully know what the the timeline looks

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,840
like we're going to ask you questions

80
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,199
about this if you take our survey or you

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,319
send this to your friend we're going to

82
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,000
ask about how long after you quit did

83
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,719
you have symptoms but I can tell you in

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,799
my personal um you know practice

85
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,598
experience I am not a CS CHS sufferer

86
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,319
but in my experience talking to patients

87
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:59,318
that have it we're

88
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:03,798
seeing um easily seven days usually 21

89
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:05,759
to 30 days and sometimes 60 plus days of

90
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,360
oh I just had an episode again don't

91
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,399
know what it was didn't know maybe it

92
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,400
was stress like Megan said maybe it was

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,158
some weird food that you thought you

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,280
could try again because it made you sick

95
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,039
a long time ago but it happened we don't

96
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,238
know but we're trying to put that

97
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,160
together so we can use that to educate

98
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,959
patients help them know because

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,960
Physicians aren't telling patients to I

100
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,000
shouldn't say any most Physicians are

101
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,599
not not telling folks that hey you might

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,439
have more vomiting over the next few day

103
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,320
you should expect to have more vomiting

104
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,279
over the next few days even though I

105
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,719
believe you and you quit three days ago

106
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,559
and that conversation is not happening

107
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,080
because phans aren't aware enough or

108
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,879
frankly the data doesn't help them right

109
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,879
now there's not a lot of evidence for

110
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,199
them to lean on and say oh yeah most

111
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,478
patients will have another episode in

112
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,038
the next 21 days they don't have that

113
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:59,719
information so that's what again the

114
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,719
survey is trying to give them some info

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,759
to lean on to more quickly and

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,080
definitively know sort of how to

117
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,080
categorize and then how to treat as

118
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,000
opposed to throwing a label on something

119
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,879
throwing an anti psychotic to help get

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,478
them out of the emergency room and

121
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,519
sending people on their merry way which

122
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:20,360
unfortunately happens more often than

123
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:22,279
not yeah no that's that's new to me like

124
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,240
I said done a few episodes on this and

125
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,359
seen some canmed talks on it and

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,360
obviously seen other things um I didn't

127
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,240
realize that the the roller coaster of

128
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,199
recovery there I thought you know you

129
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,918
you abstain your your symptoms go away

130
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,759
um it's really interesting that other

131
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:42,359
things can sort of trigger it and I mean

132
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,639
not that I'm a clinician but my thought

133
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,960
with that and you could tell me if I'm

134
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,560
on the right track is you know other

135
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,038
things are interfacing with the endoc

136
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,199
canabo system not just cannabinoids and

137
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:56,079
other things can can kind of cause uh

138
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,080
spikes in your endoc can avonoids so do

139
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,439
you think that's perhaps what's going on

140
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,599
like certain stressors triggers um can

141
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,279
sort of

142
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,039
just disre I'll hit on on one point of

143
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:12,038
that is that um often times people in

144
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,038
recover

145
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:25,879
