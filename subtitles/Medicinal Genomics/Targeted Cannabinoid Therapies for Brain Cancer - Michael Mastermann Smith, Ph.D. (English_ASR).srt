1
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:15,548
everyone how are you you guys enjoy

2
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:18,490
yourself here UCLA right on go Bruins

3
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:20,528
I a little big back little back story

4
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:22,808
and I'm gonna try to rush through some

5
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:24,129
of the more laborious slides so that you

6
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:26,980
guys can relax and maybe incorporate

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:29,289
some of them some of the main findings I

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,210
did my I was a tech here back in the

9
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,100
early 1990s

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,469
I studied pediatric brain tumors for a

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,730
long time we started studying these

12
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:39,100
things called cancer stem cells and

13
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:41,049
brain tumors it it was was it was

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,260
fascinating it was remarkable it really

15
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:46,629
I found a future and a purpose in it and

16
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:48,519
then I did my PhD here in molecular

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,320
medical pharmacology so I'm a

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,270
pharmacologist and drug developer I did

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,929
my postdoc in bioengineering because

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,550
it's developing drugs and especially

21
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:59,049
cancer drugs are very difficult so I

22
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:59,738
took some extra training and

23
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:06,599
bioengineering

24
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:06,599
I lose my talk my hitting the right bud

25
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:16,118
all right all right so the malignant

26
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:17,739
brain tumor glioblastoma brain cancer is

27
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,959
a largely untreatable deadly cancer

28
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:21,818
median survival ranges from 12 and a

29
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,009
half months around 12 an f-1 to 16 and a

30
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:25,719
half months disease is characterized by

31
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,759
extreme cellular molecular genetic

32
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:29,408
heterogeneity the standard treatment

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,569
involves surgery radiation and

34
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,100
chemotherapy it is the first soft tissue

35
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:34,778
cancer to be shown to be a disease of

36
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,968
cancer stem cell origin and there's

37
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:38,679
really no predisposing factors the

38
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:40,809
cancers happen and we just don't know

39
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:42,789
exactly who or when it's going to happen

40
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,039
but glioblastoma have a tendency to be

41
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:47,259
too tendency to be related to older age

42
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:50,189
but we also find a glioblastoma in

43
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:52,269
pediatric populations as well

44
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:53,978
brief history cancer stem cell

45
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:56,200
biologists this is about 15 years in one

46
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:58,388
slide cancer stem cells are essentially

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,889
highly malignant super cells they hijack

48
00:01:58,388 --> 00:02:02,228
natural stem cell survival and cell

49
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:04,418
proliferation process processes they

50
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:05,978
self renew to replicate themselves it's

51
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:07,298
very important in stem cell biology and

52
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:09,459
then they create the cells which

53
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:12,700
produced the tumor bulk and which

54
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:14,979
patients ultimately succumb in 2003

55
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,479
cancer stem cells were first isolated in

56
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:19,119
vitro and expanded from pediatric brain

57
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,659
tumors like I was describing and in 2013

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,640
10 years

59
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:23,139
later which sort of describes how long

60
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,989
it takes once you go from a discovery to

61
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:28,089
application in 2013 cannabinoid receptor

62
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,290
agonists both cb1 and cb2 were found to

63
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,479
be potentially effective in killing

64
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:34,060
glioblastoma cancer stem cells this was

65
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,429
drug screening we did and it was

66
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,490
directly on these cell populations and

67
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,530
it was a way for us to see oh we can use

68
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,350
these types of cell models to study drug

69
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,849
development and we can also find insight

70
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:48,189
into what drug classes might protect

71
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,319
potentially be used therapeutically for

72
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,900
glioblastoma and in the last 15 years

73
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,219
which this this point relates to the

74
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,110
fact that the cancer stem cells aren't

75
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:57,939
just in brain tumors they're in a number

76
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,220
of different cancers and the same models

77
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:01,689
have been used repeatedly with regards

78
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,729
to the culturing processes of taking

79
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:05,289
these taking cancers putting them in a

80
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:07,149
petri dish looking for stem cells on it

81
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:09,099
and it's called a sphere system and you

82
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,960
can see at the bottom those are those

83
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:13,150
are balls of cells and that's how stem

84
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,650
cells look like in a petri dish except

85
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,240
these are cancer stem cells so in the

86
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,319
last 15 years cancer stem cells have

87
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,180
been identified and a number of

88
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,489
malignant and metastatic cancers breast

89
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:28,110
prostate ovarian colorectal pancreatic

90
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:31,719
melanoma and some others as well this o

91
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,490
on the right they looked a pretty

92
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,659
picture of orange and green and whatnot

93
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,850
that is when we try to differentiate

94
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,109
these cancer stem cells spheres to see

95
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,449
whether they can turn into other cell

96
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,330
types and so the greens the green

97
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:45,519
labeling is for a marker for four

98
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,200
neurons and the orange labeling was

99
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,140
actually red but there's red and green

100
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,419
and they make orange and those are the

101
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,949
red markers were markers for neural

102
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:55,809
progenitor x' and those are some of the

103
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:57,069
earliest studies that we were doing and

104
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,199
trying to see what we actually had in a

105
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:02,769
petri Edition and study this cancer stem

106
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,359
cell phenomenon the science behind

107
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,310
cannabinoid based cancer therapy is

108
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,380
rooted in signaling pathways if you walk

109
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,699
away from this meeting and you want it

110
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:12,009
somebody asks you at the dinner table

111
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,299
what what is this deal about cannabis

112
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:15,280
potentially being used as a treatment

113
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,930
for cancer it's based in signaling

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,879
pathways that we've been studying for a

115
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,180
very long time they're very complicated

116
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:25,149
to develop drugs for I'm going to just

117
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,040
zero at zero in to what we need to be

118
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,629
focused on in this slide is that in the

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,419
very middle you're going to see a red

120
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:32,959
and green it's a KT and M tour and tour

121
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:36,159
in a KT R

122
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:39,620
sitter sort of like a therapeutic

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,060
graveyard if you will we we try to

124
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,160
develop these drugs they don't get the

125
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,870
clinical for trying to target a KTM tour

126
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,819
very difficult drugs to develop a lot of

127
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,110
the drugs that we that we try to move

128
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,990
through the clinic don't make it they

129
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,098
have they fail in preclinical so this is

130
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,360
going to become very important so I'm

131
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:55,189
gonna talk about a KTM torn they're

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,870
gonna walk away with a KTM tour like oh

133
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:58,250
my god this is a thing these are the

134
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,470
things that we're gonna be using in the

135
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,990
future to treat cancer the bottom of the

136
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,349
slide is all the cancer things that go

137
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,728
on in a cell regarding cancer so on the

138
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,279
right side epithelial mesenchymal

139
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:11,959
transition called the MT transition

140
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,209
that's that's a mechanism by which a

141
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,469
cell could pop off from tumour and then

142
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:18,258
go somewhere else so that's a mechanism

143
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,440
metastasis it's a stem cell process

144
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:23,870
tumor progression in angiogenesis cell

145
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,279
death autophagy apoptosis that's all

146
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,408
we're looking for when we try to develop

147
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,000
drugs is can we kill the cell through

148
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:30,709
pop ptosis which is cell popping and out

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,050
of figis is a realignment of the cell

150
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:34,519
that produced cell death cell

151
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,439
proliferation obviously very very

152
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:37,939
important internal biology and then cell

153
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,829
cycle we try to block the cell cycle

154
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:43,848
that the green hours are activating

155
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:45,258
signals and the orange button is an

156
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,969
inhibitory signal so there's a lot of

157
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:48,650
activation and in hittin efficient going

158
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,080
on in a cancer cell and a lot of this

159
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:52,609
happens in cancer stem cells the little

160
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:54,168
pink thing up top is EGFR that's going

161
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,490
to become important to some of the data

162
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:57,319
that's an epidermal growth factor

163
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,259
receptor it's sort of like her to but a

164
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,209
different variant of that but it was

165
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,968
very important in terms of the data I'm

166
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:07,098
about to show which is single cell

167
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:09,680
header in genesis of glioblastoma cancer

168
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:12,589
stem cells there's a lot of in order for

169
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,269
us to to use this as a procedure or way

170
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,098
to identify what's what works what

171
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:18,709
doesn't and develop therapies we had to

172
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:21,259
have some decent better tools because

173
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:22,638
most of cell biology is is is done we

174
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:24,288
use a lot of different cells and then

175
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,509
we'll we'll crack open like a million

176
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:28,610
cells and then analyze them and single

177
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:31,038
cell analysis basically takes all is a

178
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,840
lot more high content its quantitative

179
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,848
and it allows us to like label the cells

180
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,069
identify signals incorporate other

181
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:40,819
signals that might be going on in

182
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:43,550
parallel or in in concert with and we

183
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,110
use these microf oolitic chips to our so

184
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,509
so on the top slide is global by stone

185
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,790
we take the global stoma we dishes

186
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:50,980
it's cells from a petri dish Speirs form

187
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,300
then we break up those spheres and then

188
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,129
we put them in these little microfluidic

189
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,079
chips and this allows us to do really

190
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,480
high sensitive low cell number analyses

191
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,979
these the microchips were developed at

192
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,110
the Californian I know systems Institute

193
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,780
just about a block and a half away from

194
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,770
here we're looking at you GF we were we

195
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:08,679
were looking at the relationship between

196
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:11,469
EGFR and tumor suppressor p10 phosphate

197
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,850
KT and an mTOR and what happens is we

198
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,040
did we overlay the cells it's basically

199
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,560
quantitative you know static chemistry

200
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,970
we can quantitate the signal based on

201
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,339
the amount of protein that is

202
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,560
fluorescently labeled so the colors

203
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,239
represent the fluorescent labels and we

204
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,709
as I said we looked at EGFR p10

205
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,740
phosphate KT and then the third thing is

206
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:31,539
validation which is a way to quantitate

207
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,000
and see like do it the signals you find

208
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:37,270
are they relevant can can we make use of

209
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,800
it experimental data set 15 samples for

210
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:42,310
biomarkers that was it cells a sample

211
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,990
60,000 data points 15,000 cells is all

212
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,220
the cells I needed to do the analysis

213
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,600
and I'm about to show you more

214
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,250
quantitative mathematical analysis

215
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,290
algorithms basically drive the

216
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,759
relationships with it within and between

217
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,710
cells and patients we use

218
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,539
self-organizing maps they'll take a

219
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,279
molecular signature in the data set the

220
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,540
markers quantified self percentages are

221
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:07,089
mapped this is what these signatures

222
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,189
look like 15 samples and their molecular

223
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:11,889
signatures in each little circle

224
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:15,009
represents a one unique molecular

225
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,959
signature so brain cancer stem cells

226
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:18,459
have essentially up to 49 molecular

227
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,259
signatures and this just sort of

228
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:22,539
organizes that and it's according to the

229
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:23,949
patient to the patient sample so very

230
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,910
very so it was a real decimate

231
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:28,779
heterogeneity from that we from that

232
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,100
mapping we do a thing called

233
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:32,439
neighborhood frequency vectors and then

234
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,330
we do unsupervised clustering this is

235
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,919
the thing that just excited me it's

236
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,509
excited me for years and years and years

237
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,728
now that we're finally getting ready to

238
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:42,099
we now have some good good data set

239
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,889
enough enough understanding of this data

240
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,009
to make sense of it and publish it and

241
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:50,129
on the on the Left there's a

242
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:53,710
unsupervised hierarchy clustering each

243
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:57,549
column represents one patient each row

244
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:59,810
represents a unique molecular one of

245
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:02,329
those 49 molecular phenotypes

246
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:04,399
to walk away from this because the time

247
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,110
started going out molecular signatures

248
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,789
are defined by differences in EGFR

249
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,850
expression which is in pink an

250
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:12,649
activation of a KT in red and mTOR in

251
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,180
green and there's a little cheat sheet

252
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,730
on the lower left hand corner like I was

253
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,559
saying that's the therapeutic you know

254
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,028
that there's the the places that we have

255
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,649
very difficult time to develop drugs the

256
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:23,240
little black circle a KT and M tours

257
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:25,338
right in the middle of that incredibly

258
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,570
important for developing therapies for

259
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:31,310
cancer and cancer stem cells we did some

260
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,440
validation measures real quick we just

261
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:34,849
basically grew spheres and then counted

262
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,980
the spheres and found out whether there

263
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,259
was a malignancy associated with the

264
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,509
cluster 1 and cluster 2 cluster 1 had

265
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:43,100
had a higher malignant signature because

266
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:45,679
we needed less cells to plate to form

267
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,490
these little spheres and then cluster 1

268
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,949
we needed more cells to to get an

269
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,899
analysis of saying oh you know how these

270
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,790
spheres grow and it was just a you know

271
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:58,429
lots of set lots of spheres come from

272
00:09:55,789 --> 00:10:00,679
highly malignant brain cancer stem cells

273
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:03,049
not a lot of spheres come from cells

274
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,549
that are not very malignant and so you

275
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:06,049
need more cells to put in a petri dish

276
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,939
in order to do your studies and so

277
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:09,799
that's what that represents a KTM Torr

278
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,520
activated cluster to had significantly

279
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:15,500
higher sphere formation and had higher

280
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,019
sphere forming efficiency as an

281
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,669
indicator of malignancy we looked at

282
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:21,649
patient outcome because we had the data

283
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:23,029
on the patient while we were working in

284
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:24,620
the lab these patients would eventually

285
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:26,689
succumb to disease so we had outcome

286
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,940
measures of progression and survival and

287
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,000
these things are cos curves and the

288
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,070
curving is but if the curve goes farther

289
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,750
along the x-axis the patients doing is

290
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,879
doing alright they're surviving longer

291
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,440
or they have less they're not they're

292
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,000
not progressing or in the MRI doesn't

293
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,209
show a recurrence or anything

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,509
if the x-axis is closer up to the origin

295
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:50,329
the patient doesn't do as well and we

296
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:52,069
use these in terms of identifying what

297
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,089
molecular signatures are what we're

298
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,650
supposed to be looking at might be

299
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,570
related specifically to a patient's

300
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,100
survival as an outcome measure and it's

301
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,180
very important in drug development is

302
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,250
having effective outcome measures

303
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:06,679
targeted cannabinoid therapy cannabinoid

304
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,080
receptor agonist may target cancer stem

305
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,708
cells by directly inhibiting pi3 kinase

306
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,490
Akt mTOR or torque 1 which is a complex

307
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,109
one and

308
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,028
they're hard to target cancer signaling

309
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,370
pathways I'm not gonna go into this and

310
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:21,139
a lot but basically it goes right back

311
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,870
to the fact that these are very

312
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,429
difficult proteins to target they are

313
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,679
part of the cancer stem cell machinery

314
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:31,250
and we're and we're gonna I'm going to

315
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,838
show some clinical hope and promise

316
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,100
now I had to skip straight from basic

317
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,170
science right into clinical hope and

318
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,580
promise because this is really exciting

319
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,439
this is the thing that I was able to

320
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,209
look back at my data and say oh we have

321
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,990
something here that the story makes

322
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:47,000
sense in early 2017 GW Pharmaceuticals

323
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,370
found positive results in Phase two

324
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,350
proof-of-concept study in glioma or

325
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,870
recurrent glioblastoma with 21 patients

326
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,440
they used a THC CBD formulation they had

327
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:01,070
one-year survival of 83% using the THC

328
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,560
CBD formulation versus 53% placebo or no

329
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,330
formulation at all and then their median

330
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,699
survival is eighteen point three months

331
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,770
with the four on the formulation versus

332
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,360
twelve point three months placebo in any

333
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,549
and in most universes that would be

334
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,399
considered blockbuster or approaching

335
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:17,750
the direction of blockbuster so you know

336
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,950
this is really really exciting things

337
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,139
it's very good for the field it's very

338
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,820
good for our understanding of cancer

339
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,838
biology how we're going to be what we're

340
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,520
going to be looking at in terms of

341
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,589
treating cancer how we diagnose things a

342
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,389
little bit better so that we can apply

343
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,680
the appropriate therapy if it's a canoe

344
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,078
enoyed therapy or it's some saw the

345
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,419
signal transduction on pathway blocker

346
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:37,729
you know we've got to sort these things

347
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:40,250
out they'll closer we get to the exact

348
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,560
signaling pathway what a patient has the

349
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,929
better chance that we can do better

350
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,000
clinical trials and directly target the

351
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:48,439
right therapy for the exact patient with

352
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,839
the exact sort of mutations that they

353
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,910
might they might have coming from there

354
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,589
the press release from GW Pharma

355
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:56,990
cannabinoids have been shown to promote

356
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:59,829
auto Figgy which is a process of and I

357
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,539
always mispronounce that the process of

358
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:04,909
regulated self degradation by cells via

359
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:08,870
several distinct mechanisms including

360
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:10,009
acting on the a KTM tor pathway which is

361
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,690
an important intercellular signaling

362
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:15,470
pathway that is overactive in many

363
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:18,560
cancers so it's basically a convergence

364
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,670
I don't work for GW Pharma didn't really

365
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,879
know about what they were trying to

366
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:25,549
accomplish but our data it converged

367
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,419
with their data and perhaps the future

368
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:29,159
might be yes we're now looking at cancer

369
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,360
themselves these are brain cancer stem

370
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:32,129
cells we're looking for there in the

371
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,990
patient tumor the condemned annoyed czar

372
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:37,200
targeting these specific cells and this

373
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,930
is a potential improved way to look at

374
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,810
treatment be it as an adjunctive or as a

375
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:44,639
full-on therapy but we now have the

376
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:46,859
science there we now have the potential

377
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,350
these botanical drugs there and this is

378
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,560
all all very promising and when multiple

379
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,759
groups come up with the same solution

380
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:57,869
that's the sweet stuff that's what we

381
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:00,659
need to be doing all right cures come

382
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,389
through collaboration choked up spent a

383
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,549
long time since I left UCLA like five

384
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:06,960
years ago and it was like I got it got

385
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:09,870
to go do my own thing now and so it's

386
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,210
great to be back in the cancer stem cell

387
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,820
biology crew professor Harley Kornblum

388
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,259
really stewarded all of the brain cancer

389
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,690
stem cell work he was a mentor of mine

390
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:21,840
professor ed Munoz Ian he's a pediatric

391
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,820
oncologist here down in Harbor professor

392
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,800
media Cho was a resident in the lab a

393
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,629
lot of basic science studies that were

394
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,219
working on she is now in the brain

395
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:33,210
injury program and the Department of

396
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,500
Neurosurgery like a lot of other cope on

397
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,360
Tiffany jack

398
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,159
Eric these are my best friends we worked

399
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,139
very hard on very difficult problems and

400
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,459
I love the way they supported the work

401
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,870
that was going on micro fluidics

402
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,639
professor Jenks son is a professor in

403
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,950
China now she was my postdoc when I was

404
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,039
a grad student professor Ken Khmer he's

405
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,330
now doing stem cell work down in Japan

406
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,120
biotechnology and stem cells in Japan

407
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,530
Manohar says she is going to be an MD

408
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,169
PhD candidate here in the School of

409
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,329
Medicine dr. bill Wong pathology taught

410
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:02,429
me every single thing I knew about

411
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:04,500
pathology and was just a Grutter

412
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:06,239
incredible source of support in

413
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,950
neurosurgery professor gheorghe lazar if

414
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,480
he is a pediatric neurosurgeon that

415
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,210
basically green-lighted this all these

416
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,060
studies to begin with and went on to do

417
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,220
some he's a professor emeritus now he

418
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,219
was a close close mentor to mine along

419
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,440
with Harley Kornblum and Lynda Liao was

420
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,450
was there the two neurosurgeons Jorge

421
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,010
and Linda had done excellent working

422
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,840
making sure that we got the samples we

423
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:30,059
needed and you know these are all

424
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,700
through extensive collaborative efforts

425
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,739
Linda is now the chair of Neurosurgery

426
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,900
at UCLA and then in bioinformatics we

427
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,909
had another great team Tom graver and a

428
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,069
Nicholas Graham they really really just

429
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:42,899
came through and we had all this rain

430
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,300
sell data and they really made good

431
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:48,149
sense of it and they're the tom is in

432
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:50,278
CSI and Nick Graham went on to USC so

433
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm I want to thank you can med go

434
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:53,669
Bruins

435
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,049
we're all in this together and you know

436
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:57,419
I just I think we've got a great future

437
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:59,008
with cannabis based medicine for some

438
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:09,208
going after some really really difficult

439
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:11,339
and harder to treat diseases I really

440
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:13,049
wanted to make time for questions but I

441
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,519
got like a couple minutes here so if

442
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:15,870
anybody has a real question come up to

443
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,698
the mic real quick so we can get it in

444
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,610
I'm going to talk about this isn't more

445
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:22,109
memoriam to our lost Mavericks Senator

446
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,430
John McCain died of a brain tumor this

447
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,759
picture was taken if you can look o at

448
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:29,099
see it you see his left eye right I left

449
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,139
I left I he had just come out of surgery

450
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,490
a few days before this picture and he

451
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,909
was back in Congress doing what he

452
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:38,759
needed to do and he died last month Beau

453
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:41,100
Biden Vice President Biden's son died in

454
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,159
2015 and then our partner on the

455
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,870
agricultural side we were in the process

456
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,309
of trying to you know we've got to

457
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,990
create this medicine from somewhere so

458
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:52,469
so I worked with our cultural partners

459
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:55,680
and you know moving forward and Josh's

460
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,300
Stanko was just an agricultural pioneer

461
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,609
taught me every just about everything I

462
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,870
need to know about the nature of how

463
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,759
we're going to turn this into medicine

464
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,199
and me coming from the lab and then all

465
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,390
of a sudden being embraced by an

466
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,100
agricultural field was really really

467
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,839
really wonderful and we lost him to a

468
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,269
car accident last year just out of

469
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,099
nowhere but that's just how it is so in

470
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,269
more into our lost Mavericks we do this

471
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,500
for a living there's always somebody

472
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:19,019
that were that were going to be helping

473
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,240
out as we move forward so all of us that

474
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,639
run into all these catch 420s get used

475
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,919
to it but you can do great work with it

476
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,650
one minute thank you my name is Kristen

477
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,330
Walsh legal I'm an RN nerd oncology

478
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,490
nurse navigator doing this work for

479
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:33,928
about two years

480
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,298
exclusively with cancer patients using

481
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:38,700
cannabis as well as integrated into

482
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:40,408
conventional care I see a trend that I

483
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,750
haven't heard talked about in research

484
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:45,360
recently neuroendocrine tumors seem to

485
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,650
be very vulnerable to some combination

486
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,259
of cannabinoids whether it's

487
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,900
neuroendocrine tumors of pancreas cervix

488
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,640
small cell lung cancer metastatic

489
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,100
prostate cancer and I just wanted to

490
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,080
raise

491
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:57,339
awareness because it sure seems to fit

492
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,038
in the category of stuff you're

493
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:02,288
interested in looking at lower electric

494
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:04,298
and differentiated tumors yeah I'd love

495
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:05,349
to talk to you and follow up about this

496
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:06,579
because these are the kinds of things

497
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:08,288
where we have these conversations and

498
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:10,029

499
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:12,190
real clinical process that we would take

500
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:14,109
to do a clinical trial and if we start

501
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,700
talking then we might be able to put a

502
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:17,109
stitch in time with regards to these

503
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,850
clinical trials and get these therapies

504
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:22,149
