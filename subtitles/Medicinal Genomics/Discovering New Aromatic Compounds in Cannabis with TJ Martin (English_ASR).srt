canmed conference

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,120
okay we are back to our normal podcast

11
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,359
format this episode but i hope you

12
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,439
enjoyed the conversations we recorded

13
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,960
live at

14
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,839
canmed2022 and the canmed coffee talk

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,920
lounge

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
it was great to have some face-to-face

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,640
interactions with folks and i look

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,719
forward to doing it again real soon

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,640
speaking of doing it again we are

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,960
working hard behind the scenes to get

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,558
all of our ducks in a row so that we can

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,239
announce details around canmed23

23
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,879
while i'm not allowed to give too much

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,118
away i will say that next year's event

25
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,679
is going to be unlike any other event we

26
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,760
have done so far you aren't going to

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,439
want to miss it and i can't wait to

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,439
share the details

29
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,758

the announcement

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,439
this episode features a conversation

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,640
with tj martin who is the vp of r d at

37
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:41,279
abstracts a company that specializes in

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,439
research development and production of

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,599
botanically derived and cannabis

40
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,000
inspired terpenes

41
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,640
tj and his team recently published a

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,200
paper that identified a new class of

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,960
aromatic cannabis compounds called

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,280
volatile sulfur compounds or vscs which

45
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,639
are responsible for that signature

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,960
skunky gassy smell that is so prominent

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,879
in certain cannabis cultivars

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,439
this was a major breakthrough for their

49
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,919
team because as tj mentions in the

50
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,400
conversation a common criticism of

51
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,199
botanical terpenes is that they can't

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,439
recreate the signature gas smell of an

53
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,919
og or a gelato

54
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,318
it was a critique that inspired tj and

55
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,559
his team to investigate what they were

56
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,318
missing and lo and behold they found

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
vscs

58
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,958
during our conversation we discussed

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,400
abstract's process for recreating flavor

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,319
profiles for classic cannabis strains

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,439
how tj and the team used

62
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:44,318
multi-dimensional gas chromatography to

63
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,919
separate compounds by molecular size and

64
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:50,719
polarity revealing additional compounds

65
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,199
how even though vsc concentrations are

66
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,840
orders of magnitude lower than terpenes

67
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,919
their effect on our taste and smell is

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,158
much higher

69
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:04,158
the similarities in structure between

70
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:06,079
cannabis vscs and vscs found in garlic

71
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,919
and what medicinal implications that

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,719
discovery may have

73
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,598
and finally although vscs are needed to

74
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,479
create that skunky gassy aroma is

75
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:20,079
actually a combination of vses and other

76
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:22,560
terpenes that makes that signature smell

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,959
before we get to my conversation with tj

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,799
i want to thank this episode's sponsor

[Music]

94
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,798
good afternoon tj thanks for joining us

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,480
on the podcast

96
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,160
thanks for having me ben really stoked

97
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,478
being part of the podcast

98
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,040
yeah me too because today we're talking

99
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,680
all about that stinky skunky smell

100
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,720
that's so potent in certain strains of

101
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,120
cannabis

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,440
and you know for a long time that that

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
skunk smell or that gas was one of the

104
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,519
few things cannabis users could use to

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,680
judge the quality of cannabis of course

106
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,359
today we know that good cannabis can

107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,439
smell like just about anything from

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,840
fruit to herbs

109
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,240
and so tj i was hoping you could start

110
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,799
and tell us a bit about what interested

111
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,040
you about researching the causes of that

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,280
skunk smell in cannabis

113
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,199
so yeah um what really interested us

114
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,559
over here at abstracts i mean

115
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,319
we're a company here who not only are we

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,038
so we're a company that focuses on

117
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,959
cannabis flavors and aromas specif not

118
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,519
only just botanically drive but also

119
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,758
cannabis derived so we have one business

120
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,079
that's abstracts tech so we do all of

121
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,120
our non-cannabis infused flavors so

122
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,800
these are

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,800
directly replicating the exact flavor in

124
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,199
a realm of cannabis but without using

125
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,960
any actual cannabis in it so if you're a

126
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,639
brand who wants to be like coca-cola and

127
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,319
have your product in every single state

128
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,879
and country in the world but have it

129
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:29,279
taste exactly the same like you want

130
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:31,199
so you own jack hair or gelato or runts

131
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,198
or cushman's right and you want it to

132
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,478
taste the exact same in every state well

133
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,400
you can't extract it and ship it to

134
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,199
every state that'd be illegal

135
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,439
but

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,520
we can create it in a botanical format

137
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,680
using our research to directly replicate

138
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,279
that exact smell and aroma and then now

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,800
since it has no cannabis in it we can

140
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,559
ship it to every state and country in

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,639
the world so as a brand now you can

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,639
start building that

143
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,560
brand recognition and that

144
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,478
that flavor profile that people know and

145
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,918
love in every single state without any

146
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,439
concerns of variability or legality

147
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,359
and we also have our cannabis touching

148
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,199
business which are licensed extraction

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,840
facility and research facility in long

150
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,240
beach where we research

151
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,638
and understand what it what makes each

152
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,800
cannabis strain different unique

153
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,160
why does jack hair have its own unique

154
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
scent that's wildly different from

155
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,800
gelato which is also wildly different

156
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,198
from like og kush i mean yeah some of

157
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,520
these two of those have really heavy

158
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,160
gassy skunky scents to them right

159
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,918
but gelato and og kush are wildly

160
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,000
different not only from when you smoke

161
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,959
them consume them but also to just how

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,600
they taste gelato's known to have a

163
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,959
really complex layered flavor profile

164
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,039
it's a very citrus earthy musk

165
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,519
as well as a ton of gas in it right

166
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,959
whereas og is very woody piney with it

167
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,560
maybe some citrus notes depending on

168
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,038
which og you like

169
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,038
and a lot of gas on it as well

170
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,240
and so that facility not only do we

171
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,918
create

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,918
cannabis flavoring extract products we

173
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,839
also research and understand

174
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,478
what makes those things tick right why

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,119
they're all unique and different

176
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,120
great so maybe a good place to well

177
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
first of all i'm glad that you are

178
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,959
you're an expert on the aromas of

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,560
cannabis because i've been i'm curious

180
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,399
so i think

181
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,079
i was wondering can you explain the

182
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,079
different types of compounds that

183
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,159
contribute to the aromas of cannabis

184
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,519
because i think you know most people we

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
like to think most people are at least

186
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,198
familiar with terpenes

187
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,038
and that's what a lot of us associate

188
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,680
with the aromas but

189
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,918
are all you know the sense associated

190
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,120
with cannabis necessarily terpenes are

191
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,959
there different classes of those

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,038
compounds

193
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,638
so i mean cannabis produces a wide

194
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,839
variety of flavor compounds you'll see

195
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,319
everything from terpenes sesquiterpenes

196
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,439
terpenoids right as well as other flavor

197
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,720
compounds

198
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,759
these may be

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,520
esters ketones aldehydes alcohols

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,280
volatile sulfur compounds like the canna

201
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,639
sulfur compounds we discovered in our

202
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,119
paper

203
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,478
it's a whole wide variety of

204
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,240
different flavoring

205
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,758
isolates and found in cannabis and even

206
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
if you break down terpenes into things

207
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,720
like terpenoids

208
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,400
you can start seeing

209
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,160
other of these like alcohols within

210
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,839
terpenes so like a terpene alcohol like

211
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
menthol

212
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:15,119
or linoleum these are known for mincian

213
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,360
more lavendary floral scents as well as

214
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,720
aldehydes like citronellal

215
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,879
or ketones like camphor

216
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,840
these are just typical flavor isolate

217
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,319
these are

218
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,239
just different ways of how the chemicals

219
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,560
orient in space like they have oxygen in

220
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,639
them which then gives them more either

221
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,200
potentially pungent or different flavor

222
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,879
notes and your volatile sulfur compounds

223
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,560
always have sulfur on them and those

224
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,958
typically tend to be by far the most

225
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,639
pungent right i mean you can smell you

226
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,879
know when you're driving by a weed grow

227
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:48,399
by the skunky smell not by

228
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,399
you know the minty smell right

229
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,360
yeah so you know in reading through your

230
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,200
paper

231
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,720
you determined that the

232
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,480
the compounds that create the skunky

233
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,040
smell are these volatile sulfur

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,680
compounds like you mentioned so

235
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,319
how did you determine that it was this

236
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,599
new family of volatile sulfur compounds

237
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,360
that were creating the smell and not

238
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
more of the well-known like isoprene

239
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,519
derived compounds

240
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
well we didn't know going into it right

241
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,320
we just we went into the project knowing

242
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
uh

243
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,399
cannabis gas is something that as an

244
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,199
industry we don't know definitively what

245
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,799
it is we know skunky gassy smells

246
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,680
obviously exist we can smell it in the

247
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,039
plant

248
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,439
but at the time there was really no

249
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,519
terpene products out there that directly

250
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
recreated this there was no products

251
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
really on the market that did and so

252
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
into the project was well we know

253
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,159
there's some strains that have less gas

254
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,679
than others or no gas like a jack herrer

255
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,319
and there's some that have a ton of it

256
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,479
like gelato and og kush and so we just

257
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,720
started procuring a lot of

258
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,159
fresh really high-end genetics

259
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
because of our extraction facilities

260
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,519
licensed we have the ability to procure

261
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
from anybody within the california

262
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,879
marketplace

263
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,800
and just sort of pulling in lots of

264
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,120
different samples and analyzing them and

265
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,120
looking for trends to see

266
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,278
if we if this strain smells gas in

267
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
another what are the differences here

268
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,480
where is this trend going

269
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,519
um that's we'll see in the paper we've

270
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,879
kind of oriented these from

271
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,959
highest gas to something from like

272
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,639
something like boccio gelato which

273
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,119
anybody's consumed bachelor gelato from

274
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,958
scherbinski is extremely gassy right

275
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,560
by far some of the most pungent weed you

276
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,159
can find on the market

277
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,399
um all the way down to something that

278
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,078
doesn't really have any skunky smell to

279
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,159
it's really good but doesn't have skunky

280
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,679
notes to it like jackhair that's not

281
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,278
really what it's known for

282
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:35,120
and then everything else in between

283
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,639
so yeah so tell me a bit more about how

284
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,720
you went about designing the experiment

285
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,559
to identify these compounds like what

286
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,079
was novel about your approach and why

287
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,879
hadn't anyone kind of found these

288
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,879
compounds before so your typical testing

289
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,679
labs and a lot of cannabis companies are

290
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,039
going to have something like a

291
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,399
one-dimensional

292
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,039
gas chromatograph with a mass

293
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,958
spectrometer on it that is i don't know

294
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,439
how familiar you are with it but gc

295
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,239
basically separates based on

296
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,000
molecular size in a 1d system and a mass

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,000
spec allows you to see

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,839
what those compounds are right but it's

299
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
very limiting it's good for what it does

300
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,680
it's high throughput it's affordable

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,679
but it does have its limitations because

302
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,759
you're only going to see anywhere from

303
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,159
20 something to maybe cap out at 80 to

304
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,559
100 depending on how deep you go into

305
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,838
your method development right whereas we

306
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,159
have is a custom built out

307
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,560
multi-dimensional gas chromatograph

308
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,278
which allows us to only separate based

309
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,958
on molecular size but also polarity so

310
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,120
some of these volatile sulfur compounds

311
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,518
these oxygenate species that may come

312
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,278
out at the same time as a terpene are

313
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,519
now able to separate out in the second

314
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,879
dimension and we get way better chemical

315
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,720
characterization

316
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,799
and we also have a mass spectrometer on

317
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,399
there and also a sulfur

318
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,159
chemiluminescence detector which allows

319
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,799
us to see all those specific sulfur

320
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,799
compounds only on the detector so kind

321
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,039
of helps guide our research

322
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,199
really fancy expensive equipment right

323
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,639
it's very specialized it does take a

324
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,879
specific science team to actually run

325
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,799
it's not as easy as a 1d by any sense

326
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,759
and you do not get it it's not as high

327
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,359
throughput

328
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,319
but what you lose on your throughput you

329
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,720
gain on the characterization abilities

330
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,879
interesting interesting so

331
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,560
adding that second dimension

332
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,799
enabled you to get you know more

333
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,679
resolution to see you know kind of maybe

334
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,278
similar weighted compounds that are

335
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,120
different in other ways

336
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,278
correct the end will be similar weighted

337
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,278
but because they have say oxygen in them

338
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,879
or sulfur now they're going to separate

339
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,720
out from those compounds that don't have

340
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,240
any oxygen or sulfur in them

341
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,079
right now

342
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,720
so in that one dimensional readout it

343
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,399
would just look like all the same thing

344
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,440
correct on a 1d system if you're running

345
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,039
a typical 1d system you're going to see

346
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,800
obviously all your peaks right well

347
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,719
within one of those peaks say like five

348
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,639
minutes there could be one compound

349
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,920
there could be 20 compounds there right

350
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
they'll come out they all loot out the

351
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,039
same time you have no way of separating

352
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,399
it into the second dimension because

353
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,078
you're a 1d system

354
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,519
whereas ours we pull it into that second

355
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,599
dimension so now it's like having you

356
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,320
get a second layer of separation

357
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,040
right

358
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,040
so i'm curious so what

359
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,559
what other terpenes kind of come up at a

360
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,319
similar time point as these uh vscs like

361
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,439
were we kind of

362
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,079
maybe

363
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,519
misappropriating some of the the gas

364
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,000
smell to a different terpene just

365
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,120
because it has a similar weight

366
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,720
i mean i have to look in the data

367
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,720
specifically to see exactly what's

368
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,920
coming at the same time but

369
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,600
i mean

370
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,759
these vscs are in very minor

371
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,399
concentrations so even on a typical 1d

372
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,399
like you're talking these vscs are

373
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,240
low part per million typically in part

374
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,839
per billion range

375
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,959
whereas terpenes are in the percent

376
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,320
level

377
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,239
right you're if you're talking about the

378
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
relative weight to one another

379
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,680
um like mercine

380
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,160
a lot of strains like an og is going to

381
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,919
be like it's aroma fraction 60 to 70

382
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,838
percent may be emerging

383
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,639
whereas that volatile sulfur compound is

384
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,920
just

385
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,000
i mean your sub

386
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,360
sub percent you're way down there so on

387
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,958
a typical system even if you were

388
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,560
looking for it you're just not going to

389
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,799
see because there's a there's such a low

390
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,278
concentration unless you have that extra

391
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,838
layer separation or if you have

392
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,278
the right detector to look for it

393
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,600
yeah but in this case a little goes a

394
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,759
long way right because you know even if

395
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,759
it is you know orders of magnitude lower

396
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,679
than those other terpenes like

397
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,519
that's usually what breaks through

398
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,559
that's the most pungent smell that you

399
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,919
get oh yeah this is where i mean just

400
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,319
because it has a lower weight doesn't

401
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,838
mean it's impact on your sensories or

402
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,519
that much lower right

403
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,079
every isolate has a different pungency

404
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,879
to it and sulfur compounds as we're all

405
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,359
aware

406
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,240
with um like skunk spray itself from

407
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,800
like an actual the animal skunk itself

408
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,799
very pungent right super super pungent

409
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,078
you can smell skunk from miles away at

410
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,679
that point right

411
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,359
same thing with cannabis these things

412
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,000
aren't in high concentrations but their

413
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,560
organoleptic impact how it impacts your

414
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,360
um how you taste and smell very very

415
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,479
high

416
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,639
um

417
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,800
now are they even lower

418
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,959
yeah now are they more volatile than

419
00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:00,000
your typical terpenes too like do they

420
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,759
you know sort of burn out fast

421
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,559
um some of them yeah like

422
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,039
like

423
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,679
parental mercaptan one of the main files

424
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,958
we detected in um in cannabis super

425
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,278
volatile

426
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,559
really really volatile i mean

427
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,559
it's definitely more volatile like

428
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,599
beta-carotelline and the sesquiterpenes

429
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,719
right those aren't i mean those are

430
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,519
volatile but they're not as volatile

431
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
and

432
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,759
i haven't really done

433
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,680
extensive studies to quantify it but

434
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,159
it's definitely i'd say more volatile on

435
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,399
things like miracin as well

436
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,838
interesting so i know that as part of

437
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,839
your research too you were you're

438
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,079
looking at how these levels of these

439
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,920
vscs change throughout the plant's life

440
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,519
cycles hoping you could talk a bit about

441
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,439
that

442
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,440
yeah so in the paper we kind of we also

443
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,360
did a greenhouse experiment where we

444
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,120
grew out cannabis plant monitored the

445
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,278
vsc

446
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,919
evolution through from when it was first

447
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,600
growing it weak everything from week one

448
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,958
all the way through cure

449
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,440
when it was finished curing and what we

450
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,319
see is around week seeks weeks six and

451
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,959
seven

452
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,480
is when the plant starts producing

453
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,479
these volatile sulfur compounds these

454
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
cancer sulfur compounds

455
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,120
and i mean we were growing out i believe

456
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,039
it was gelato specifically in the paper

457
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,720
we obviously different cultivars are

458
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,639
going to be different right

459
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,480
this is cannabis has so many different

460
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,879
cultivars and so many different strains

461
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,720
that it's just this wide variety of

462
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,519
potential here but typically when we saw

463
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,199
on gelatos right around week six sevens

464
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,799
when it starts and then

465
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,319
definitely right when secure is finished

466
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,159
that's when it's at its height that's

467
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,800
when there's just so much concentration

468
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,879
those via season exp makes sense right

469
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,120
super fresh wheat as you mentioned

470
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,879
when you're looking for quality

471
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,240
um specifically like on like an og or a

472
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,000
gelato

473
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,839
the fresher it is the more gassy it is

474
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,198
and you know that it tastes better has a

475
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,639
big has a more perceived euphoric impact

476
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,838
just a better overall product at that

477
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,839
point and makes sense it's fresh

478
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,838
yeah and i know that you you looked also

479
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,240
at the storage conditions for some of

480
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,120
these uh flowers that you got a hold of

481
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,198
too um so what is sort of the optimal

482
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,480
storage conditions to preserve these

483
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,558
vscs

484
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,400
so i mean we haven't we're still looking

485
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,639
into storage conditions right i don't

486
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,400
have a ton of data on that but

487
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,919
i mean if you look at it from if you're

488
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,240
comparing like a mason jar to like a

489
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,400
sandwich baggie two very common typical

490
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,160
ways people may store cannabis at home

491
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,480
sandwich baggies

492
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,240
not exactly conducive to keeping things

493
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,599
away from air right

494
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,959
it's going to off gas a lot it's going

495
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,759
to leave the baggie because they're not

496
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,919
fully sealed whereas them like a mason

497
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,359
jar or any kind of type of canning jar

498
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,880
it's gonna have a nice tight seal on it

499
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,839
which explains why you're able to

500
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,080
preserve your cannabis longer right

501
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,639
absolutely and what about extracts do

502
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,000
the vscs sort of go through the extract

503
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,679
process

504
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,519
yeah in our paper we looked at some

505
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,960
extracts um

506
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,480
because we have an extraction facility

507
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,558
right so we did some experiments with

508
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,038
our hydrocarbon extractors and we saw

509
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,000
that these these can of sulfur compounds

510
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,119
do go from the flour into the extracts

511
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,519
and that makes sense right if you're

512
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,399
somebody who loves waxes whether it be

513
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,558
rosins or even hydrocarbon extracts

514
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,480
they're still gassy they still have that

515
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,359
gassy skunky note to them so you can

516
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,160
smell it there so you know it's there

517
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:16,000
absolutely absolutely and now you know

518
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
one part that kind of stuck out to me in

519
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,400
the paper too and you have a nice

520
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:24,240
visualization of this was the similarity

521
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,280
between these um cannabis vses and the

522
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,038
vsts that are also found in garlic

523
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,599
i was wondering if you could speak a bit

524
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,640
about that and i'll definitely include a

525
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,719
a screenshot or a picture of

526
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,480
that visualization that you had because

527
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,558
it's really it's really interesting to

528
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,319
see just how similar these compounds are

529
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,558
it's just that cannabis has an extra i'm

530
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,079
sorry i'm not a chemist um so it has a

531
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,960
few extra lines on there and i'm sure

532
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,558
you can explain um what that is

533
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,919
yeah so i mean when we're that was

534
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,240
actually we didn't this is not something

535
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,840
we anticipated at all right we were just

536
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,160
we really just want to see what makes

537
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,000
cannabis tick where is this gassy skunky

538
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,160
smell come from and as we're going

539
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,839
through the data it was just

540
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,679
really strange that

541
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,839
if you look as like as a trend from the

542
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,600
garlic bottle sulfur compounds and same

543
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,000
thing the cannabis ones

544
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,759
you have very similar structural motifs

545
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,640
going through them all as far as like

546
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,640
how the sulfur is oriented in space

547
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,080
um cannabis has that same thing but

548
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,320
instead of being an allele it's a

549
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,798
mercaptan group so you have the extra

550
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,720
two methyl compounds on the very end so

551
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,279
you have two more carbons to it but the

552
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,120
actual sulfur aspect of it on the end

553
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,000
rather be the terminal

554
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,719
vial or sulfur bonded to it to a methyl

555
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,038
group or being a disorder being a

556
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,919
disulfide or just a sulfide in the

557
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:41,519
middle

558
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,840
it followed that same trend as what you

559
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,279
see in garlic and so these compounds

560
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,798
actually in garlic

561
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,798
like allele files what's being

562
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,000
investigated for its anti-cancerous

563
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,599
benefits

564
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,599
and some of the other files mentioned

565
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,879
are being have been

566
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,359
potentially attributed to the

567
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,440
cardiovascular beneficial properties of

568
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,678
garlic as well so that begs the question

569
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,200
of like does cannabis have similar

570
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,360
benefits does it have other medical

571
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,798
benefits from these can of sulfur

572
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,678
compounds

573
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:09,839
in

574
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,679
that we've detected um and are they

575
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,119
similar is it more pronounced is it

576
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,038
something different

577
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,798
does this change how cannabis impacts

578
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,000
you right does this potentially explain

579
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,720
why

580
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,880
can't

581
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,480
fresher cannabis has a bigger impact on

582
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,799
the body than say

583
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,599
six months a year old weed i mean any

584
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,119
but any avid consumer will know that

585
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,599
i can tell you from at least from

586
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,119
anecdotal evidence they prefer prefer

587
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,879
fresher wheat that makes sense right we

588
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,519
don't we don't go to the store and buy

589
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,840
eight-month-old oregano you buy you want

590
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,400
fresh oregano for your products the same

591
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,000
thing applies here but the begs question

592
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,440
how does this impact the actual

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
experience of the product and what

594
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,798
medical benefits are there

595
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,600
it's a question we don't know the answer

596
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,440
to yet but love to find out

597
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,599
yeah we'd love to find out too and if

598
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,840
there's any listeners who are looking

599
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,000
for something to investigate to maybe

600
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,079
potentially bring to a future can med

601
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,759
this would be a great topic to to take

602
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,399
on and this really ties back to what you

603
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,240
were saying before too right where you

604
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,159
at your business you're looking to

605
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,720
recreate a lot of the aromas that are

606
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,640
associated with these signature strains

607
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,600
but using compounds that aren't cannabis

608
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,240
derived so is this a good example of

609
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:23,439
where you could use some

610
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,038
otherwise derived compounds to recreate

611
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
a cannabis smell

612
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,798
yeah so i mean with our research over

613
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,120
abstracts labs where we have our

614
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,038
cannabis license and our

615
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,119
instrumentation for analyzing we have

616
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,798
our multi-dimensional gc

617
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,239
we're able to see everything that's in

618
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,319
the plant right that's at least that's

619
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,200
volatile which attributes the majority

620
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,759
of its flavor and aroma and we can take

621
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,120
that data and then recreate it using

622
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,359
the same iso it's like prenatal more

623
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,439
captain isn't only found

624
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,519
um in cannabis it can be found in other

625
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,679
things like when you look at

626
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,119
say skunky beers like a corona like a

627
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,280
light struck beer

628
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,239
that has pronomer captain in it

629
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,558
and so

630
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,640
these compounds can be found some of

631
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:05,678
them in other botanical species so we

632
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,600
can

633
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,559
you can extract these isolate them out

634
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,719
and then use them in the same ratios

635
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,480
and have the same compounds to directly

636
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,319
recreate that exact same scent because

637
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,960
pronomer captain if it's isolated from

638
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,960
cannabis or isolated from

639
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,720
i might say hops or some other botanical

640
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,759
species once you isolate it down into

641
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,679
high enough

642
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,759
high enough concentration it's going to

643
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,280
smell and taste the same and just about

644
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,279
matching those direct ratios

645
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,240
yeah and i know as part of your paper

646
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,199
you

647
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,359
you were trying to reverse engineer some

648
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,759
of the aromas of the cultivars that you

649
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,199
were studying um talk a bit about that

650
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,359
and you know i thought it was

651
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,679
interesting that there seems to be an

652
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,439
entourage effect when it comes to aromas

653
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,200
as well

654
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,558
yeah i mean with that we obviously have

655
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
the data to know everything that's in

656
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:57,519
there and so we wanted to recreate it

657
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,199
isolate by isolate and see

658
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,200
when does it start smelling skunky and

659
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,640
gassy right it's one thing for to see

660
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,159
trends in the data it's a whole other

661
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,080
thing to actually experience it and

662
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,760
confirm this is what it is

663
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,000
so we take the major terpenes things

664
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,079
like myrsine limonene carrot flame

665
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,599
terpenolane pinenes right

666
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,879
start adding those in the right ratios

667
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,279
that we're seeing in

668
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,720
say boccia gelato and just kind of going

669
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,158
down the list and adding in other

670
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,519
terpenes or flavor compounds for

671
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,159
identifying and

672
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,639
noticing when does it become that skunky

673
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,120
gassy aroma and it's not just pronoun or

674
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,640
captain by itself yes pranamar captain

675
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,719
as well as some of their canon sulfur

676
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,400
compounds are a huge driver for it but

677
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,000
you also need those terpenes there you

678
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,519
don't have those terpenes and terpenoids

679
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,279
it's not going to smell like cannabis

680
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,200
it's not going to smell like that

681
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,079
signature gassy scent it's just going to

682
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,679
smell

683
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,798
very sulfurous

684
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,360
um

685
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,200
maybe potentially a little bit caddy or

686
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,599
skunky but it's not like the cannabis

687
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,360
gas like you would notice in an og or a

688
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,879
gelato that makes

689
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,798
so it's what the cannabis community

690
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,320
loves so much right and so really what

691
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,480
we were doing just utilizing that data

692
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,200
and just slowly going down and seeing

693
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,120
just trying to identify one by one what

694
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,759
what's needed and we did this with just

695
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,000
terpenes we did with just the vscs as

696
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,440
well as we then adding the vscs to the

697
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,960
terpenes to see

698
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,120
what is that scent that we're looking

699
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,120
for

700
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,278
yeah and you mentioned that you know it

701
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,759
it is

702
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,679
such a signature aroma and one that the

703
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,759
the community loves so much

704
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,120
and you know it has to be part of the

705
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,359
reason why

706
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,759
you know the what is the original skunk

707
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,479
always seems to be to come up on social

708
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,440
media

709
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,120
and

710
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,278
it's just interesting how that skunk

711
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,239
smell has become just so synonymous with

712
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,240
cannabis

713
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,319
that's super polarizing right the

714
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,919
cannabis community loves it people who

715
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,480
don't consume cannabis a lot of times

716
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,400
hate it yeah absolutely hate it

717
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,759
they're just really put off by it and

718
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,600
maybe that's why

719
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,119
they may prefer strains if they're new

720
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,399
consumers in the market they're looking

721
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,839
for something a little bit fruitier more

722
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,440
like jack hair

723
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,199
but regardless i mean

724
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,919
mine does research

725
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,880
kind of elucidate

726
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,880
potential health benefits to look into

727
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,240
obviously calls out exactly where these

728
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,240
scents come from

729
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,319
but provides guidance for people who are

730
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,839
trying to odor mitigation or

731
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,359
controlling the odor and they're on

732
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,639
their growth so that way

733
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,319
you're not upsetting the general

734
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,720
community around you right

735
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,240
yeah can't lose inside that i mean yeah

736
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
our community really enjoys this scent

737
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,079
but a lot of the population doesn't

738
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,759
unfortunately right it is a very pungent

739
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,798
scent that does permeate everywhere it's

740
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,440
at i mean

741
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,720
drive through downtown l.a there's a lot

742
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,038
of cannabis grows and you'll smell just

743
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,558
driving on the freeways crazy

744
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,240
yeah and like you said earlier i mean

745
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,240
that is the scent that people associate

746
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,480
with cannabis you know if you

747
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,480
if you smell a more fruity

748
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,839
um strain out there in the wild you're

749
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,360
not immediately going to think cannabis

750
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,439
but when you when you smell that gas

751
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,798
like there's no mistaking like

752
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,240
what that is

753
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,639
exactly and i'm curious too like with

754
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,720
your business i mean your business is in

755
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,720
recreating aroma so was there a lot of

756
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,000
demand for creating this scent in

757
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,839
particular

758
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,079
i mean that's always been a critique of

759
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,359
botanical terpenes right not going to

760
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,439
shy away from that i mean it's one of

761
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,678
the critiques on social media is that

762
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,519
botanical terpenes may capture some

763
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,038
aromas of cannabis do really well with

764
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,038
like hazes and

765
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,879
jack carrera type strains

766
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,319
but when it came to ogs it was

767
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,840
significantly lacking that it missed

768
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,678
that signature

769
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,199
gassy skunky aroma

770
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,278
and scientifically i mean i was just

771
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,679
interested in why what is that that's

772
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,038
why we kind of pursued this project

773
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,679
and being able to actually recreate in

774
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,919
that flavor and fragrance format

775
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,440
allows brands now to

776
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,799
like i said take their product across

777
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,640
state markets

778
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,319
across state lines country lines and

779
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,000
have that exact flavor and aroma now

780
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,599
because we can directly recreate it

781
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,278
using these compounds

782
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,959
don't get me wrong it's a lot of work

783
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,720
it's very expensive ton of work a lot of

784
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,798
time to recreate that exact profile but

785
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,440
once you do i mean it's really rewarding

786
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,119
you can there are some people who we've

787
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,480
created products i mean

788
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,759
one of the stories i like to show people

789
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,079
or tell people about is when we first

790
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,440
started making these discoveries

791
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,960
when we were reverse engineering and

792
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,960
recreating these products we started

793
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,880
formulating some vape pens in our lab um

794
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,079
we also did some with cbd

795
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,440
started handing them out people and they

796
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,439
started smoking through and tasting them

797
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,720
compared to just regular botanical

798
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,080
blends and

799
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,360
when they would smoke the ones that had

800
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,199
all the compounds in there from all the

801
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,639
reverse engineering work

802
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,798
some folks back oh this is a really nice

803
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,799
light resin pen like well it's not a

804
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,960
live resin pen that's actually botanical

805
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:27,839
terpene we've just been able to identify

806
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,759
and

807
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,199
really pull in all the different flavor

808
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,440
isolates that previously had been

809
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,600
undiscovered in cannabis

810
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,679
and so when you're able to

811
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,918
really recreate it and make the product

812
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,120
taste like live resin i mean just as the

813
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,038
scientists are just so cool you know

814
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,199
what i mean being able to finally figure

815
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,798
those things out

816
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,480
yeah that's quite the vote of confidence

817
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,759
to be uh or the seal of approval to get

818
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,319
that um

819
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,839
to get that that's great um

820
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,240
yeah and before we started talking you

821
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,240
were you were talking about how it's

822
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,399
great at your facility or it's great

823
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,519
that management of your team

824
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:07,519
has this publish first sort of mentality

825
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,440
because you know a lot of other folks

826
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,359
who who would have made this discovery

827
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,960
especially in your field may have held

828
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,439
back that information and not made it

829
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,798
public so speak a bit about why you

830
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,919
thought it was important to share this

831
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:19,359
information

832
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,320
yeah i mean i'm very blessed here at

833
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,839
abstracts we have an ownership team that

834
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,519
really believes in educating the

835
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,959
cannabis community and

836
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,319
sharing this information that's so

837
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,798
important to the community and that

838
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,480
science team as well that really really

839
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,240
buys into that as well

840
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,000
and so we made these discoveries i mean

841
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,599
if you're in a typical privatized

842
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,720
industry it's very common that most of

843
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,480
your work

844
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,480
doesn't get published maybe you get a

845
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,399
patent here and there when it's it's

846
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,839
possible but the rest gets filed away in

847
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,759
the basement and never to see the light

848
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,079
of day whereas the approach here with

849
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,519
abstracts our ownership is hey we have a

850
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,359
community

851
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,519
um that really wants to see this

852
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,119
information we think it really benefits

853
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,798
the community

854
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,719
as well as this is a plant that

855
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,519
historically hasn't been researched very

856
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,839
much

857
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,278
this could be due to you know it's

858
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,879
pretty difficult to research in

859
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,038
university setting you have to go

860
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,039
through a lot of red tape

861
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,480
you have don't really have access to all

862
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,079
the different cultivars that are on the

863
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,360
market like we do

864
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,119
and so when we found these cool

865
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,599
discoveries that we thought man the

866
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,519
community will really love to see this

867
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,199
you have to publish it right you can't

868
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,639
discover the gas and not tell the

869
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,278
community about it it would just be i

870
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,799
mean such a travesty the industry to not

871
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,720
show this information to the whole world

872
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,480
and educate the whole community

873
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,759
and it was great i mean the community

874
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,599
really loved it

875
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,679
everybody fully bought bought into it

876
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,678
was looking at reading the paper really

877
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,880
appreciated all the support

878
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,480
and

879
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,399
hopefully it just encourages more folks

880
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,000
to publish as well because as a

881
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:46,879
community there's not a lot of science

882
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,480
out there

883
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,480
and the universities can't touch it i

884
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,919
mean yeah they can research cannabis but

885
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,360
they can't research cannabis that's

886
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,960
grown by like a scherbinski's or cookies

887
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,479
or jack hair

888
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,240
any of the major brands that you're

889
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,519
seeing in all these states like

890
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,000
these are not strains that the

891
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,720
universities can research but we can as

892
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,839
a privatized community and when we have

893
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,839
actual license facilities

894
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,599
yeah you're absolutely right and you

895
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,759
know i think that we at medicinal

896
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,759
genomics kind of share that same

897
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,398
philosophy and that's always been our

898
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,679
approach is to is to publish and get the

899
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:22,798
information out there to benefit the

900
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,880
community and it's part of the reason

901
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,119
why we put together canmed right is to

902
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,880
bring together these other people who or

903
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,798
other companies who are

904
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,919
sort of taking up the mantle for for

905
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,278
getting research going on this

906
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,799
on this plant because like you said

907
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,398
there are universities that are coming

908
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:39,440
on but they're you know they're studying

909
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,439
hemp

910
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,798
which is you know very valuable and a

911
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,480
lot of it's going to apply also to

912
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,278
cannabis but you're right in terms of

913
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,519
really looking at these well-known

914
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,798
cultivars that are are purely cannabis

915
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,759
and are not going to be mistaken for

916
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,158
hemp

917
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,879
it's really up to the private companies

918
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,039
to

919
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,720
uh to do the work

920
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,079
exactly i mean like i mentioned the

921
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,519
beginning of this

922
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:02,720
big fan of medicinal genomics for a

923
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,399
while here love

924
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,000
love all the work you guys are doing

925
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,000
i think it's great to educate and

926
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,839
support the cannabis community

927
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,599
it only helps better serve our community

928
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,879
by having people who are more educated

929
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,240
on their products

930
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,840
helps them make buying decisions when

931
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,519
they're looking for things that may

932
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,798
how's this going to impact them what

933
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,000
flavors are they looking for it's no

934
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:21,359
longer just

935
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,679
i'd love to get two point words longer

936
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,959
just strained names right and marketing

937
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,798
strain names but actually how do these

938
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,120
things smell and taste how do these

939
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:31,599
things impact you because there's

940
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,038
so many cultivars out there they're so

941
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,158
wildly different

942
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:35,200
there's just i mean there's a ton of

943
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,399
work to be done but that's what makes it

944
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,399
so much fun

945
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,959
yeah yeah we need to get beyond just

946
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,439
straight thc values too right

947
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,440
oh for sure i mean it was just thc

948
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,759
values why would jack hair

949
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,320
impact you differently than an og kush

950
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,079
or then a gelato or a run right

951
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,599
i mean anybody who's an avid consumer

952
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,199
can tell you the difference and how it

953
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,398
impacts them especially when it's fresh

954
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,880
right

955
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,038
yeah absolutely all right so winding

956
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,120
down here tj before i let you go i want

957
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:06,158
to give you a chance to plug any social

958
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,518
media or websites or other resources

959
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,519
that you think that the listeners would

960
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,159
be interested in learning more about

961
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,399
yeah you can follow our social media at

962
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,360
abstracts tech on instagram so we post a

963
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:16,879
lot of

964
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,199
our new product launches where our

965
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,278
research goes any educational pieces or

966
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,000
collaborative work we do as well as our

967
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,960
website abstractstech.com it's abstracts

968
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,038
with an x by the way not a ct

969
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,159
and on abstracts tech dot com you can

970
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:31,599
buy

971
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,039
all of our different terpene products

972
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,119
whether they be typical flavor blends

973
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,319
because we do create traditional flavors

974
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,879
as well as

975
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,480
our cannabis inspired products

976
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,278
also on there to republish all of our

977
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,278
white papers and our different pyramid

978
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,398
publications as well so we have some

979
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:48,558
really interesting ones on there your

980
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,398
community may enjoy like we did do a

981
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,319
white paper looking at what is the

982
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,599
difference between

983
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:57,839
flour hydrocarbon extracts and rosin

984
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,519
extracts of the exact same exact same

985
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,959
cult of our same lot

986
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,278
but applied different extraction

987
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,200
processes and we looked at the different

988
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,200
flavor and terpene isolates found in

989
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,720
each and how those changed to try and

990
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,399
the way we can

991
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,839
i mean because we all know they do have

992
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,798
different flavor profiles and why is

993
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,558
that

994
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:15,839
so we went ahead and looked at it so

995
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,759
definitely something to check out we do

996
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,199
publish that on our website

997
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,480
excellent yeah we will definitely be

998
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,960
checking that out

999
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,759
all right thanks again tj for joining us
