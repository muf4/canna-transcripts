[Applause]

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,400
good afternoon

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,879
i met with kyle turley over lunch and we

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,960
decided we're going to

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:22,239
try and pass some legislation about mike

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,240
heights limitations

7
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,719
it's an ada issue for all those of us

8
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,320
who are taller

9
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,799
we feel it would be only fair to have

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,920
mics that reach where we are

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,799
i'm going to take uh i'm going to if you

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,239
can am i loud enough out there i am

13
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,799
going to take a moment

14
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,919
um i'm going to take a i'm going to

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,399
steal a play

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
from dr mushulem's playbook from his

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,759
comments last night at dinner

18
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,919
because i think there is a similarity

19
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,878
between those speaking immediately after

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,399
lunch

21
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,919
and those speaking immediately after

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,799
dinner and

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,440
so i i do have some formal comments to

24
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,839
make but i

25
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,280
also i will be telling a story because i

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,800
thought his story last night was

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,600
absolutely wonderful for those of you

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,359
who got to

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
hear it and i think it's actually part

30
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,079
of the the documentary that was done

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
about him

32
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,400
uh the story in particular about how he

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,359
and he relayed some of it this morning

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
went to uh to the police to to

35
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,640
essentially

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
take cannabis that was confiscated and

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
use it for science i think it's just a

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,200
fantastic story

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,080
um i i'd like to echo also something was

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
said earlier this

41
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,400
this i believe truly will when we look

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,799
back in a decade from now

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,478
uh i think this day today in this

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
auditorium will be

45
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,840
considered a milestone event and i'm

46
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,839
just a real

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
um

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,479
i i'm just so honored to be part of it

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,560
and i do

50
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,399
i will say i do feel a little bit like

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,960
an undergrad student at a

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
graduate lecture so i hope you'll bear

53
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,679
with me

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
um so my story my story is

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,960
and some of you have heard it so for

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,280
those of you who heard it i apologize

57
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,959
for

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,320
repeating but my story is about these

59
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:10,000
two little girls this is uh

60
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,919
sorry uh so

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,639
this is adding cassie and they were

62
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:18,000
little kids and um

63
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,759
in 2005 and today they're 14 i think in

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,199
this picture they were give or take

65
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,439
a little over a year

66
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,839
they were they were hell-bent to be

67
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,959
movie stars

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,159
running around you know around age 3 age

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,560
4 we began to see

70
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,519
a little bit of notice of wobble in

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
their gate

72
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,680
a little bit of developmental delay

73
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,598
but we had a perfect life at that time

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,280
this is my wife chris she's sitting in

75
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:50,878
the audience with a different

76
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,479
style of hair um ultimately we ended up

77
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
in the hospital for testing

78
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,840
um it actually was initially diagnosed

79
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,759
by

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,598
uh their pediatric doctor dr sorenson

81
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,878
discovered that they both had enlarged

82
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,039
spleens it was initially diagnosed as

83
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:07,840
mononucleosis

84
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,959
which commonly uh manifests itself in

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,800
enlarged spleens but

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,039
we quickly realized that that was far

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,080
more than that

88
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,799
we went through a battery of testing the

89
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,440
diagnosis the odyssey of diagnosis took

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,599
uh well in excess of 18 months

91
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,639
including what you see here which is the

92
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,359
beginning of the

93
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,759
eeg process ultimately they were

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,000
diagnosed with a really horrible

95
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,759
and largely fatal untreatable

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
cholesterol disorder called neumann pick

97
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,199
type c this is a lysosomal storage

98
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,439
disorder

99
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,399
it manifests itself all those little red

100
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,158
dots on that

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,599
on that chromosome sequence are known uh

102
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,318
genetic defects

103
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,439
of that particular chromosome the mpc

104
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,759
gene the mpc

105
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,359
gene so my kids have what's called mpc

106
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,438
type c

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,959
which means that they do not process

108
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,079
cholesterol either in

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,759
or out of their cells well

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,080
particularly their organ cells which is

111
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,798
why they got larger in large spleens

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,599
but most importantly and most uh deadly

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
is the

114
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,199
uh the death that happens to their brain

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,598
cells

116
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,039
and so it's a very severe neuro

117
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,798
degenerative disease

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,239
from the onset of symptoms which in my

119
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,560
children took place

120
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,399
in around their third year their life

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,280
expectancy is somewhere between four and

122
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,039
five years

123
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,839
beyond that point it's an auto recessive

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
gene i won't

125
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,279
dive into this this is my you know

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,680
undergraduate work and

127
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,279
it'll bore most of you to tears so we

128
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,040
ended up at the mayo clinic as many

129
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,799
folks do

130
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,199
met with a doctor at the mayo clinic who

131
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
specializes in neiman pixie

132
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
he essentially told us that there was

133
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,919
one experimental drug that was improved

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,280
in europe not approved in the united

135
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,719
states if we could convince our

136
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,559
insurance company to spend the hundred

137
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,360
thousand a year per kid to put them on

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,959
it

139
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,280
we could use it as treatment for our

140
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,079
children and it was only expected to

141
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,559
make a 10

142
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,879
difference in the outcome wasn't a good

143
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,000
diagnosis and certainly wasn't a good

144
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,199
uh prediction of outcome we then ended

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,478
up at the nih

146
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,000
in bethesda there was an a natural

147
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,360
history study underway

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,279
uh sponsored by the nih and thank god it

149
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,120
was underway because it became the basis

150
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,638
in some ways for what we ultimately

151
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,560
achieved as parents

152
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,240
to find a drug for our kids my wife and

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,879
i immediately formed a research

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,199
foundation

155
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,038
raised a few million dollars and started

156
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,439
putting it to work

157
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,680
piggy backing off then already existing

158
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,680
research in the npc community

159
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,519
from very very very fine researchers

160
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,280
and frankly we entered into the

161
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,359
ecosystem of npc

162
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,719
at a very fortunate time so the kids

163
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
went through a full week of testing at

164
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,160
the nih

165
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,399
and our life changed immediately we

166
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,240
became citizen scientists

167
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,239
my wife and i have technology and public

168
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,120
relations backgrounds predominantly we

169
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
met at netscape i spent my early part of

170
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,319
my career at apple and

171
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
other technology companies we became

172
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,120
scientists

173
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,400
and what we discovered along the way

174
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,399
very quickly was

175
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,599
a compound called cyclodextrin

176
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,159
cyclodextrin is a

177
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,840
grass compound it's used as an incipient

178
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
as a solubilizer

179
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,918
in many many products it's the basis for

180
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,439
the product febreze it's in almost every

181
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,359
single procter gamble product

182
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,279
it's used in mayonnaise to enhance

183
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,280
flavor it's used in

184
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,439
soft drinks chewing gum you name it

185
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,519
you're you're surrounded by cyclodextrin

186
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,279
almost anywhere you go in our country

187
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,879
it turns out that cyclodextrin is an

188
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,959
active ingredient and is now

189
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,759
in phase two three clinical research at

190
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,519
the nih to treat my children's disease

191
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,960
we were the first my kids were the first

192
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,399
to see this disease so i've already

193
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,719
talked a little bit about this

194
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,839
so we became drug developers the problem

195
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,520
is that the drug

196
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,198
was only available in pharmaceutical

197
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,719
grade as part of another drug

198
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
it was manufactured by jansen

199
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,199
pharmaceuticals a subsidiary of j and j

200
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
we reached out to j j and said hey how'd

201
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,478
you like to share your

202
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,079
drug master file and your manufacturing

203
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,560
technology so that we can make this drug

204
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,560
ourselves

205
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,520
yeah and that was pretty much what they

206
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,758
said in response

207
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,560
you know and uh and my wife being who

208
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,000
she is

209
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,079
those of you who know know what i'm

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
about to say she didn't take no for an

211
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,079
answer

212
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
and she immediately wrote a blog that

213
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,159
says said

214
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:30,960
effectively does johnson and johnson

215
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:32,400
care about children

216
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,598
and the answer was yes we care about

217
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,679
children and oh by the way we've

218
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,839
rethought our position and we will not

219
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,840
we will not only share your our drug

220
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,439
master file for the use of cyclodextrin

221
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,879
as an active ingredient in your drug we

222
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,639
will actually set up a manufacturing

223
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,439
facility and make this drug not only for

224
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
your children

225
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,719
but for all the children in the world

226
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,960
that can get a

227
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,639
compassionate use ind approved by the

228
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,878
fda by their doctor

229
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,240
and subsequently now i think about 100

230
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,840
kids around the world are

231
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
on this amazing drug

232
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,478
and effectively what we're talking about

233
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
is translational medicine we're talking

234
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,079
about

235
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,439
repurposing an existing compound in this

236
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,279
case it wasn't known as an active

237
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,800
ingredient has subsequently become so

238
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,038
and we're repurposing it in the

239
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,199
translational medical science

240
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,199
and that took filings with the fda

241
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,960
you'll notice the pink binders those are

242
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,800
unique colors to our children and my

243
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,560
wife chose them so that they would get

244
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,680
attention at the fda and ultimately get

245
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
our approval so

246
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,879
in less than 18 months after our

247
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,080
diagnosis at the

248
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,599
uh at the han ultimately the diagnosis

249
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,240
took place out of testing from stanford

250
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
but

251
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,560
uh within 18 months out of the test with

252
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,760
the testing we had submitted and gotten

253
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,439
approval to

254
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,240
treat our children with cyclodextrin

255
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,080
intravenously

256
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,240
uh by the way we had tried it through

257
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
the gut initially only to find out that

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,919
that that it doesn't pass through into

259
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,360
the bloodstream and more importantly

260
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,958
once we started treating our children

261
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,120
intravenously we discovered through

262
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,559
follow-up research that we had sponsored

263
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,639
that it doesn't really pass the

264
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,278
blood-brain barrier very well either

265
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,159
so not only did we file an ind for

266
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,519
intravenous

267
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,278
treatment of cycloadduction with our

268
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,839
children we then subsequently filed

269
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,159
another

270
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,560
compassionate use ind with the fda to

271
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,240
get our kids treated intra-thickly in

272
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,599
other words a spinal tap straight into

273
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
their spinal cord

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
and for the last four and a half five

275
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,719
years they have been

276
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,039
receiving every other week they receive

277
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,080
either an intravenous infusion which

278
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,679
turns out does actually in small

279
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,720
quantities pass the blood blame

280
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,519
blood the bbb

281
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,200
but it also turns out it helps their

282
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,639
their systems their organs and so forth

283
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,759
clear cholesterol

284
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,879
uh and they on the off week we take them

285
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,240
to the hospital

286
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,919
they're fully anesthetized and they

287
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,039
receive a spinal tap to receive this

288
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,159
drug into their

289
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,838
uh csf and it has we believe

290
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,639
extended their life by quite a lot they

291
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,120
are now uh 12 years old here's uh

292
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,799
the initial installation of their ports

293
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,879
for the intravenous infusion so they get

294
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,439
it mainline port infusion every

295
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,000
every other week on thursdays and here's

296
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,920
the very first compounds that we made

297
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,278
these compounds were actually made at

298
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,759
our at the pharmacy

299
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,399
in our local hospital in reno nevada

300
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,319
they were

301
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,240
compounded by this wonderful man on the

302
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,560
left his name is adam porath

303
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
he's a little-known pharmacist hospital

304
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,599
pharmacist who

305
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,600
i think is part of an amazing story

306
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,278
that is now saving other children's

307
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,519
lives he was the first one to figure out

308
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,958
how to do all the osmolarity testing all

309
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,639
of the necessary

310
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,399
sterilization because we were actually

311
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,919
receiving the compound in a powder form

312
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,639
and it had to be turned into a drug that

313
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,799
would be

314
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,078
acceptable to the fda to be not only

315
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,919
infused into the

316
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,879
into the bloodstream but also into the

317
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,078
past the blood-brain barrier

318
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,078
here are the kids receiving their

319
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,078
infusions at the infusion center at reno

320
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,519
so 400 and plus i think it's now more

321
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,879
than 500 iv infusions later they get

322
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,200
megadoses

323
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,200
uh you know we started we started down

324
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,440
the path by the way walgreens

325
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,040
has been unbelievable in this process

326
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,120
they actually helped us work through a

327
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,639
third ind which got us approval to treat

328
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,839
our children at home so we no longer

329
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,639
have to take them to the hospital for

330
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,240
this treatment

331
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,679
we have a little pump that we treat them

332
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,639
at home

333
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,719
so cyclodextrin then the whole effort

334
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,679
took off so we worked with the nih

335
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,440
the nih ultimately licensed or sub

336
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,278
licensed all of the data that we

337
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,519
collected as ind patients plus a whole

338
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,720
bunch of data they created in-house

339
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,120
through a small i think n of six uh

340
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,560
phase one sort of safety clinical study

341
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,000
it's now in phase two

342
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,919
dash three on the fast track

343
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,440
phase study supported by a company

344
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,000
called vitesse who licensed all the

345
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,160
technology

346
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
and is taking over the drug as a as a

347
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,639
manufacturer

348
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,480
so it's a great story um

349
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,639
and our dream was a sterile solution

350
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,720
that was you know

351
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,959
available for both iv and it and it's

352
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,440
and it's now happening

353
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,958
so there it is manufactured by janssen

354
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,120
available in sterile bottles

355
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,559
and i give i have to say we just don't

356
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
do this enough i want to give public

357
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,838
credit

358
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,519
to jansen j j for for stepping up and

359
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
doing this they didn't have to do it

360
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,839
it was risky on their part and they were

361
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,480
just amazing amazing partners in this

362
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
whole process

363
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,720
so the twins are still alive they had

364
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:25,838
their 12th birthday last january

365
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,839
i think that's amazing of itself

366
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,240
after all these treatments we've seen no

367
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,639
toxicity

368
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,560
creeping in their plasma oxyteral

369
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,600
biomarkers have really improved and

370
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,958
especially their

371
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,040
seven keto cholesterol levels tau and a

372
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,638
beta levels are dropping

373
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:47,759
almost all the signs of of neurological

374
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,839
stress inflammation or degradation are

375
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,600
are improving as a result of this it

376
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,200
turns out and we've already talked a

377
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
little bit about mechanism of action and

378
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,959
the mysteries of mechanism of action

379
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,958
it turns out during this entire process

380
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,359
not none of the scientists involved had

381
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,879
any idea how cycloadduction was working

382
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,278
the assumption is that it was working

383
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,240
similar to the way that cholesterol

384
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,120
you know uh is that odors are captured

385
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,560
by febreze

386
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,799
turns out that that's not the case and

387
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,559
just this last week a seminal paper was

388
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,319
published about cyclodextrin and its use

389
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,879
in the treatment of atherosclerosis

390
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,920
which elucidated its mechanism of action

391
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:26,078
and that's a day that's for another day

392
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:28,240
but exciting okay so we sort of

393
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,919
stabilized our children with a drug

394
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,600
through the fda process

395
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,120
became aware of what's involved in doing

396
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,040
that

397
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
really respect those of you who are

398
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,319
involved in that process because it is

399
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,440
daunting and involved and expensive and

400
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
time-consuming

401
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,959
but it wasn't helpful for my kids

402
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,120
seizures our kids

403
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,000
stuff began suffering several years ago

404
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,159
from

405
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,519
nowhere near the dravet kids sort of

406
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,000
levels of seizures but still

407
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,799
an a disturbing level of seizure

408
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,480
activity

409
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,399
we did like every other parent does we

410
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,879
tried to treat it with pharmaceutical

411
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,559
meds

412
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,399
it basically just turned our kids into

413
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,359
zombies had horrible side effects for

414
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,600
them

415
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,560
and decided to chase uh cannabis it

416
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,079
turns out that dr

417
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,679
gupta's story um you know we'd won

418
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,439
about the stanley's in charlottesville

419
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,000
and so forth was just coming out

420
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,920
uh or had you know after we about six

421
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,198
months after we started looking at it

422
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,278
long story short

423
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,639
we had already been sanjay had already

424
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,000
been covering our story about

425
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,440
psychoaddiction in our kids so we had

426
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,480
been interacting with him and he had

427
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,800
mentioned to us

428
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,879
as had others about trying cannabis so

429
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,799
this is actually a picture of one of the

430
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,639
very first bottles of oil that we

431
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,719
used when we treated our kids we started

432
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,360
this treatment several years ago

433
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,480
we were this bottle is approximately an

434
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,839
18 to 1 cbd to thc ratio

435
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,839
suspended in a safflower oil

436
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
what we discovered in the process of

437
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,519
treating our kids with essentially

438
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,198
what i would largely say as a very

439
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,078
sophisticated home

440
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,679
grown oil was that the supply of this

441
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,159
oil and its safety

442
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,000
was of paramount importance to us so we

443
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,399
took what we had learned in our process

444
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
of

445
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,679
you know working with cyclodextrin and

446
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,360
building a drug through the fda

447
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,439
and formed a company that we call

448
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,240
strains strains

449
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,000
purpose in life is to be a world-class

450
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,799
high quality manufacturer

451
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,919
of cannabinoid cannabinoid and others

452
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,399
cannabis based

453
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,679
products in oil form and in other routes

454
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,879
of administration

455
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:27,278
as possible by state regulations so we

456
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,240
embarked um and have just recently

457
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,159
announced

458
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,680
eight million dollars in funding to

459
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,120
launch our product development

460
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,838
our more importantly our product

461
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,879
manufacturing efforts in the state of

462
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,160
colorado

463
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:42,240
washington state and nevada

464
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,319
we have facilities built and ready to

465
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,639
produce products in seattle denver and

466
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,879
soon to finish in reno as well

467
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,198
here's an example of the machine that we

468
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,919
use this is a 70 liter co2 extraction

469
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,078
machine

470
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,439
it's just one part of a complex process

471
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,359
of making these oils

472
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,480
to the highest grade standards that we

473
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,639
know how to make and

474
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,959
i i think to what the industry is making

475
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,000
at this time

476
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:08,479
we make a multi-ratio product 20 to 1 1

477
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,480
to 20 and one to one in the middle

478
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,600
and from these three products a parent

479
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,959
or a patient could

480
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,199
come up with a ratio of their own design

481
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,799
obviously capped by 20 to one at the

482
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,240
high end on the cbd spectrum

483
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,679
so i want to talk a little bit about so

484
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,320
that's our story that's my story and

485
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,120
here's

486
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,000
i i know that the title of my talk for

487
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,320
today was

488
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,159
was about rescheduling so out of

489
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,720
necessity i have become a little bit of

490
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,120
a cannabis policy wonk because

491
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,759
uh it worries me as a business person to

492
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,679
take

493
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,720
my investors money without a clear path

494
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,919
for how they're going to get their

495
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
returns

496
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,838
i want to make these medicines under the

497
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,278
belief that we can actually get them out

498
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,079
to lots and lots of people and

499
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:49,278
ultimately as

500
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,319
i think we all know that's going to

501
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,000
require some form of rescheduling

502
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,360
i'm not sure that rescheduling is the

503
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,159
answer i will say that

504
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,759
if i could make wave my magic wand and

505
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,198
convince the cannabis community

506
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,879
i think we should hold our ground and

507
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,480
insist on a de-scheduling

508
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:09,919
or or the creation of a

509
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:12,078
[Applause]

510
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,240
i think we or or better yet the creation

511
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,918
of a parallel path let's face it tobacco

512
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,120
and alcohol are on a parallel path

513
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,520
they're not on schedule

514
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,359
anything although they arguably should

515
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,759
be certainly if cannabis is

516
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,519
so i would like to see the there there's

517
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,359
already a movement afoot

518
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,279
the states have already said we're gonna

519
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,319
we're going to authorize the creation of

520
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,798
cannabis

521
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,798
let's let the federal government embrace

522
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,839
that idea let's let the states regulate

523
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,240
the product

524
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,359
let's layer on top of that federal

525
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
regulation which

526
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:45,599
really focuses on the gmp process our

527
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,279
facilities are designed to gmp cfr 111

528
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,719
which is the nutraceutical or dietary

529
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,240
supplement standard

530
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,440
i think that that's the minimum standard

531
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,880
that should be established i'd like to

532
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,558
see the federal government insist that

533
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,679
the states enforce that standard just as

534
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,038
they insist

535
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,440
that the states enforce things like

536
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,519
diversion or proximity to schools and so

537
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,360
forth so there are ways to regulate this

538
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,839
product without putting it into this

539
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,159
the drug schedule and certainly most

540
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:11,199
importantly without putting it into the

541
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,400
crosshairs of the fda for you know the

542
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,440
full monty

543
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,200
on on on drug approval process

544
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,120
there are so many incarnations of this

545
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,160
drug that can be delivered as a dietary

546
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,199
supplement

547
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,279
um and and we that should be allowed and

548
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,840
i just hope that we can figure out as a

549
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,839
society how to do that

550
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:36,240
okay one more soapbox cannabis belongs

551
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,440
to mankind

552
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,558
cannabis does not belong to one company

553
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,679
one brand one method of

554
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,720
action one process technology it belongs

555
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,919
to all of us

556
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,240
i come from a world that pretty much

557
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,679
embraced open source technology in the

558
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,720
software community

559
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,519
open source as a concept has become

560
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,038
further and more recognized as a viable

561
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,720
capital endeavor

562
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,240
i'd like to suggest that we as a

563
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,558
community

564
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,558
make a pact with each other to treat

565
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,639
cannabis as a shared asset

566
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,759
and not to lock it up not to put it

567
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
behind the

568
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,679
pharma fence not to put it in a cage

569
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,038
where people can't make it unless they

570
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,600
have a patent on it

571
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,879
this is uh this is one of my as a parent

572
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,558
and as a patient advocate

573
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,240
one of my worst nightmares is that we

574
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,639
will

575
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,038
you know not learn from the from the

576
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,038
past

577
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,038
finally to uh somewhat in honor of dr

578
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,200
michoulem certainly but

579
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,640
uh in honor of my children and all the

580
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,519
patients out there who need more

581
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
understanding

582
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,279
dr goldstein this morning talked about

583
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,279
it almost everyone has talked about it

584
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,960
we need far more research especially

585
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,200
human clinical research

586
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,720
so in the spirit of not having enough to

587
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,880
do my wife and i

588
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,079
got together and we asked the irs to

589
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,000
give us approval to

590
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,599
create a research foundation called

591
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,400
peoplecam peoplecan is now approved as a

592
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:00,719
501c3

593
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,880
specifically to fund organize and

594
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,558
orchestrate human clinical research

595
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,039
in cannabis worldwide we actually just

596
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,038
thank you

597
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,240
we actually just got approval and we

598
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,599
just hired an executive director i'd

599
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,319
like jason to stand up

600
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:22,079
jason smith

601
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,079
so we're just getting started and the

602
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,639
first task is to raise a little money to

603
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,599
to to build out the infrastructure uh

604
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,799
i'm of the

605
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,959
opinion um informed i hope and opinion

606
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,720
that it is possible to do clinical

607
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
research on cannabis

608
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,200
in the united states without the dea's

609
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,600
approval without even the fda's approval

610
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
this

611
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,359
this product is a dietary supplement in

612
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
many of its forms

613
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,000
and we can research it uh as such and so

614
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,480
we intend to

615
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,759
work with the irb community figure out a

616
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,200
way to get this done

617
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,879
and embrace the rest of you in that

618
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
process so

619
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,039
i hope you'll engage with us in that

620
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,840
process on on many levels

621
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,839
thank you very much
