projects

7
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:26,679
if you've ever downloaded a Shutterfly

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,118
I am listen as a patent inventor on that

10
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,679
particular project I'm involved I was

11
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,269
involved in the FedEx print online

12
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,780
application that allowed you to upload

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:40,050
documents to FedEx and pick them at up

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,939
pick them up at a FedEx Office location

basically what I'm saying is a developer

16
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:47,820
and have been focusing on front-end

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:53,620
development for most of my life as a

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:56,469
professional I discovered this I the

19
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,909
reason I share this is because I want to

20
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:00,700
let you know that I've been involved in

21
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:04,658
the in the in the software industry and

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:08,200
cryptocurrency I believe is the next

23
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:10,840
evolution in software and I love to see

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,909
the cryptocurrency industry in places

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,820
like this a little bit out of place a

26
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,780
little bit kind of why is this guy here

27
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:18,639
kind of feeling

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,368
I love being that guy and I want to

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,000
introduce you and invite you into the

30
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:29,349
next evolution in economy that's going

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,819
to happen I believe that events like kin

32
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:36,250
med and sponsorships and things that the

33
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:40,269
medical genomics is doing on the -

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:42,519
blockchain are just a sample of what's

35
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:44,590
coming in the future economy I call it

36
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,569
the fractal ization of niches the

37
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,868
blockchain is going to touch every

38
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:51,669
single aspect of our society in some way

39
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:53,650
shape or form and if you haven't

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,659
understood this yet and you've just

41
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,390
heard about this thing called Bitcoin or

42
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:00,460
you're wondering what - is doing here

43
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,540
let me explain to you what I think is

44
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:09,299
going to happen first the information

45
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,790
that we have been giving to

46
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:16,830
organizations like the government

47
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:19,269
Facebook Google all of these things that

48
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,390
invade our privacy in ways that we don't

49
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,400
really understand at a very basic level

50
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:26,319
the ways that they invade our lives and

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,460
collect the data on where you had

52
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,829
breakfast this morning

53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,620
what hotel you stayed at what your

54
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,850
current your credit number credit score

55
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,740
is you know your bank account balance

56
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:41,259
how much money you make who you work for

57
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,540
who your friends are what your friends

58
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:45,669
buy what you buy what you buy for your

59
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,719
friends all this information is being

60
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:50,559
collected on us

61
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:53,229
- believes and the - ecosystem believes

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,390
as an ethos that privacy is very

63
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:58,030
important that's why a lot of people

64
00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:01,569
think that - is a privacy coin which is

65
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,949
it kind of is it offers privacy it's

66
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,739
always opt-in privacy

67
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:07,989
now that's just one of the things that -

68
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,740
is doing what you get with that privacy

69
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:14,620
is the ability to treat a digital token

70
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,390
a scarce digital token as cash it's as

71
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,150
good as cash you can exchange it at

72
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,738
places like cannabis stores and nobody

73
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,360
has to know that that's what you're

74
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,870
spending your money on because you can

75
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:31,450
opt in to a private option this is why -

76
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:33,879
is here - the - masternode network as an

77
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,729
organization and I should say at this

78
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:39,039
point it is a legal legally recognized

79
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,530
Association the - Association of

80
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,199
masternode owners is listed as the

81
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,060
beneficiaries on a New Zealand trust

82
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:50,109
that is administered by a Swiss

83
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,659
organization that has the the Swiss

84
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:56,769
excuse me switch administrator that is

85
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:59,650
legally bound to protect the interests

86
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:01,659
of the beneficiaries and again the -

87
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,980
masternode owners association of

88
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:06,069
masternode owners which is an

89
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:08,619
association of random people anonymous

90
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:10,599
people throughout the world who own -

91
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,189
master notes and I will tell you what

92
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,129
that is if you're not aware in just a

93
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:18,279
minute this association of master note

94
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:22,569
owners is the beneficiary of this trust

95
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:26,409
and the Swiss administrator is bound to

96
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:28,259
work on behalf of that beneficiary with

97
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,189
regard to the assets what are the assets

98
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:35,079
currently -

99
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:37,569
- poor group incorporated and - ventures

100
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,979
which hasn't quite listed yet but - core

101
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,170
group Incorporated is a Delaware

102
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,319
corporation that currently employs about

103
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:47,290
70 people roughly about half of whom are

104
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:50,019
developers charged with the duty of

105
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,629
improving and sustaining the -

106
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:54,789
masternode network the - master dote

107
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:58,060
network is a protocol it's actually a

108
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:00,160
copy of Bitcoin with improvements it

109
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,800
works just like Bitcoin if you know how

110
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,080
Bitcoin mining works you put a node on

111
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,730
the network you mind on the network use

112
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:13,089
spin hash cycles and you can earn tokens

113
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:15,790
on the network if you add to the ledger

114
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:16,239
if you add the next block to the to the

115
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,460
ledger

116
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,870
that's the blockchain the chain of all

117
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:23,229
the transactions that happen on the

118
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,870
network this network is public open

119
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:29,830
source and censorship resistant meaning

120
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,170
you can send money to anyone in the

121
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,539
world and nobody can stop you this

122
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,460
basically makes you your own bank it

123
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,150
removes central banking from the

124
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:43,419
equation of issuing money and managing

125
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:45,159
money but it does put you in the

126
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,350
position of having to take

127
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,510
responsibility for all the things that

128
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,660
banks and governments do in terms of

129
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:55,209
issuing and transmitting money to people

130
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,610
around the world the nice thing about

131
00:05:55,209 --> 00:06:00,279
this is we get a little bit of our power

132
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,340
back we are empowered to control our

133
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:06,459
financial futures by managing our funds

134
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:08,168
in a way that nobody can stop us nobody

135
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:10,120
can tell you that you cannot transact

136
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:12,849
with this person and nobody can stop

137
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,340
your your account from functioning at

138
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,980
any time as long as this public open

139
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:22,629
source platform continues to exist which

140
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:25,600
it has for about three years just on the

141
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:27,779
- masternode network the Bitcoin network

142
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,390
has been going about 10 years now and

143
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:33,969
the reason that I believe so very

144
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,610
strongly that cryptocurrency is going to

145
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,740
in fact disrupt every single industry on

146
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,620
this planet is because we've already

147
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,810
seen I have been privileged to see three

148
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,300
instances of such disruption in my

149
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,060
or lifetime of 42 years first time

150
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,759
happened when I was nine years old with

151
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,310
the PC revolution when my dad would not

152
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,918
buy me a strobe light and in my nine

153
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,009
year old angst I learned to code basic

154
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:04,299
and turned that IBM PC Junior into a

155
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:06,069
strobe light god damn it and I was very

156
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,060
pleased to have done that and I realized

157
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:11,189
as a nine-year-old child that that was

158
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,389
going to change the world

159
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:15,660
empowering a nine-year-old to turn a

160
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:18,009
computer into a strobe light means that

161
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,900
anybody in the world with a computer can

162
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,550
do a lot of very powerful things a lot

163
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:24,099
of very powerful calculations a lot of

164
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,129
interesting things both in terms of

165
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,090
graphics and as we've seen here science

166
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:32,439
and academics and education worldwide

167
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:34,449
the next time it happened I was running

168
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,250
a BBS a bulletin board system when the

169
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,719
internet came about and I told my

170
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,639
parents that they needed to invest in

171
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,290
FedEx and UPS because of your box store

172
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,639
in the world it's gonna disappear and

173
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,590
everything's gonna be shipped around the

174
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,470
world I mean how else you gonna get your

175
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:49,029
products well now I'm seeing that soon

176
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,850
enough we'll be able to fabricate them

177
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:53,500
off the black blockchain and they'll

178
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,789
just have corner locations where you

179
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,620
just fabricate whatever you want to

180
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:59,889
fabricate give it about 20 years I

181
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,569
promise you it's gonna happen so this is

182
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,560
what I think is going to enable be

183
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:10,300
enabled by these blockchain systems this

184
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:13,030
this exchange of value that has come in

185
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,889
in this quarter quarter century of this

186
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:17,829
information age as we're currently

187
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:20,129
labeling it is now going to include not

188
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:22,990
only information and media and

189
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:26,589
connections and social aspects of our

190
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:29,740
society but now we have an exit strategy

191
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:32,319
from the centralized banking and

192
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,990
government controls over value we don't

193
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,459
need to have borders on our value we

194
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,279
don't need to ask for permission to

195
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:41,918
exchange value and soon enough we won't

196
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,509
need to ask for permission to trade many

197
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,329
many billions and millions of dollars

198
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:48,370
worth of value and perhaps even the

199
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,980
dollar won't be the denominating factor

200
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,149
of the future that's what I think is

201
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,980
gonna happen

202
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,470
and I would like to make sure that

203
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:01,180
everybody know is that this is happening

204
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:03,759
because we right now are in this 1% this

205
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:06,279
very small population that are becoming

206
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:10,000
aware of cryptocurrency 1% of the world

207
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:11,679
which means the value that exists on all

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,139
of the cryptocurrency networks which is

209
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,000
currently around 200 to 250 billion

210
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:20,439
dollars depending on how you look at it

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,049
happens to be close to about the same

212
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,450
amount that the Federal Reserve drew

213
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:29,649
down beat on its balance sheets between

214
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:31,720
September and October of this year what

215
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,659
I the reason that I share this is that

216
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,399
there is an immense amount of value that

217
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:39,429
is out there in various organ is a

218
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,610
various situations of value whether it's

219
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:44,589
gold or many hundreds of claims to that

220
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,690
gold that sits on top of gold in bond

221
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,080
markets or banking industries and things

222
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,290
like that

223
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,970
that will very likely be subsumed into

224
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,349
the script of currency market and the

225
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,840
reason that it's going to go that way is

226
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,120
because the blockchain offers a public

227
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,879
open source ledger that anybody can

228
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,970
confirm whether or not value has been

229
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,889
transferred just like a retail cannabis

230
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,779
business who wants to accept something

231
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:10,509
of value in exchange for their goods and

232
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,100
services that's why we're here and the

233
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,169
interesting thing about this masternode

234
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,310
network this - masternode network is

235
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:21,399
they vote on what to fund they vote

236
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:23,769
every month on whether or not to pay the

237
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,480
salaries of the core team they vote

238
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:29,699
every month on whether or not to support

239
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:33,310
events like can med or to support the

240
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,950
etching and hashing of the new genomes

241
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:39,549
that medical genomics discovers - a

242
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:41,650
public open source repository that will

243
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:43,809
be available for as long as the network

244
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,819
exists these are the things that I think

245
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,500
are for the public good these are the

246
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,430
things that are going to attract people

247
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:54,279
who believe that they should have should

248
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:58,539
be more empowered financially with their

249
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:01,569
own data and attract themselves to and

250
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:04,089
opt-in to this this new economy that I'm

251
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,950
hoping that we can build together and so

252
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,889
the reason that I'm here

253
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:12,210
is to say if you want to build this

254
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:16,389
future with me if you want to assist

255
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:18,430
Doug and medical genomics and excuse me

256
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,139
I said Doug Kevin Doug has been helping

257
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:23,319
me a lot at the event today and medical

258
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:26,500
genomics in this process of bringing

259
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:30,160
data to a public space of bringing value

260
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,889
to ourselves of removing the controls of

261
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,990
the system of control that the current

262
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:38,559
banking and and government institutions

263
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,810
offer us and empower ourselves to

264
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,909
exchange value among one another and

265
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:44,859
exchange information among one another

266
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:46,689
and create public open source

267
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,810
repositories that are censorship

268
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:52,000
resistance to change and manipulation

269
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,969
some of these things are going to be

270
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,830
wonderful for us a scientific journaling

271
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,180
mechanism is it's going to be wonderful

272
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,650
I don't know exactly where that project

273
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:01,149
it's at but that's that's gonna be a

274
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:04,689
wonderful thing that's gonna be added

275
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:06,939
and I want to help build this I went all

276
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,610
in when I read the Bitcoin white paper

277
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,770
in 2015 which I recommend that you do

278
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,629
it's a very interesting kind of

279
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:16,720
financial political statement once you

280
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:18,610
read it and if you're at all involved in

281
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,620
software are capable and understanding

282
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,919
some of the principles that are in this

283
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,950
document you'll see that the intent of

284
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:29,589
the thing is very simply to say look we

285
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,900
don't need these banks anymore and we

286
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,330
don't need governments in the business

287
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,429
of printing money because we have

288
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,830
another option here and we don't want to

289
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:41,139
centralize that control in any entity

290
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,730
because as has been demonstrated

291
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:46,360
throughout history whenever whenever we

292
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:50,019
centralize that money and power into an

293
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,180
entity they typically abuse it and it

294
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,309
attracts corruptible people and those

295
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:56,199
corruptible people often end up

296
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:59,500
corrupted and once you have a system of

297
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,750
corruptible people you it's it's a

298
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,200
difficult situation to exit and so I

299
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,509
realized that that Bitcoin whitepaper

300
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,120
offered an exit strategy to humanity

301
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:14,610
that we never had before and I want you

302
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:18,340
all to see this help see how this

303
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,329
cryptocurrency movement of whom only 1%

304
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,100
of

305
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:22,979
the world is aware right now of which

306
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,259
only 1% of the world is aware right now

307
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:29,829
we can start to bring this into our own

308
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:32,199
lives as I have now one thing I will

309
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:33,758
warn you at this point never if you are

310
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:35,889
looking at cryptocurrency as an

311
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,629
investment only invest what you're

312
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:40,119
willing to lose now

313
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:44,110
me when I started investing in the

314
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:46,209
cryptocurrency industry I very quickly

315
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,999
realized that most of my life I had been

316
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:50,258
living paycheck to paycheck so it really

317
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:53,110
wouldn't make a whole lot of difference

318
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:55,808
if I just went all in with my crypto and

319
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,850
my job so I started earning everything

320
00:13:55,808 --> 00:14:00,519
that I had in crypto and I said moved

321
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,350
everything out of the Fiat system now

322
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,119
that's me because I'm okay losing

323
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,999
everything because I know that I can

324
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:10,959
start from zero and that's okay now if

325
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:12,159
you're there with me I will help you but

326
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,438
if you're not there and you just want to

327
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,969
dabble a little bit come visit us at the

328
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:17,798
dash booth at the exhibitors Hall

329
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,809
tonight or tomorrow I think we're gonna

330
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:22,058
close up early tonight but tomorrow I'll

331
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:23,860
be there all day come talk to me we'll

332
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:26,438
set you up a wallet we'll get you

333
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,350
transacted at least once maybe you can

334
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:31,629
get one of these nice - shirts and you

335
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,058
will have received your initiation into

336
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:36,069
the cryptocurrency industry just that

337
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:38,889
simple now I'll tell you at this point a

338
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:41,289
little bit of context Bitcoin was the

339
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,778
first it's ten years old since then

340
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:45,488
there have been thousands of crypto

341
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:48,188
currencies and tokens that have been

342
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:50,679
created if you're not aware - is only

343
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:52,838
one of them but by measurement of market

344
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:54,879
capitalization - has always been in the

345
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,860
top 20 since it's been introduced into

346
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,199
the system and the whole market has

347
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,239
fluctuated quite a bit if you're if

348
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,698
you're not aware it peaked as a markets

349
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:04,959
almost to a trillion I think it got to

350
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:06,698
about eight hundred and seventy eight

351
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,518
billion in market capitalization for the

352
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:12,298
whole market in December January this

353
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,298
past year and now again we're down a

354
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:17,470
huge percent almost 60 70 % down to two

355
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:20,798
hundred billion I think it even got

356
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,569
lower for a little while just to show

357
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:23,558
you that it is a volatile market so if

358
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:26,378
you don't have the guts for that

359
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:28,868
volatility don't again don't invest but

360
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:30,428
watch this watch how it happens if you

361
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:32,769
want to transact if you want to gain

362
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:35,169
your privacy if you want to gain control

363
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:36,278
your own finances pay attention to

364
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:40,659

mention I do not work for a particular

390
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,068
company - is the first decentralized

391
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:51,129
autonomous organization of which there

392
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:52,868
are many now but as a Dow were all free

393
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:55,420
agents every one of us who is working at

394
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:57,490

395
00:16:55,419 --> 00:17:00,428
and we are not paid to be here I was not

and there's a lot of cryptocurrency

400
00:17:06,548 --> 00:17:10,538
conferences happening and I personally

401
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,548
prefer anything that has nothing to do

402
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:14,439
specifically with cryptocurrency so

403
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:16,449
