1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,760
um so we're going to talk about canabo

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,919
hyperemesis syndrome today which is one

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,798
of the few true indic

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,399
contraindications to using cannabis I do

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:20,480
have a conflict of interest in that uh

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:23,640
ketoscience has originated a screening

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,079
test uh for the genomics of this

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,320
disorder uh so I do have a vested

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,759
interest um so this is the paper that

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,920
came out of it and we're going to be

11
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,679
discussing this in detail subsequently

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,879
after some introductory material there's

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:44,280
a link there this is also open source so

14
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:48,320
you can access it on PubMed free or at

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,679
Ethan russ. org at the library

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,238
tab first what is this so this was a

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,399
real mystery it was first described in

18
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,078
2004 in Australia and eight patients but

19
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,359
the index patient first one that

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,760
manifested symptoms was cleared back in

21
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,400
1996 so you can imagine going eight

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,359
years with this mysterious illness that

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,799
nobody could treat um they nailed the

24
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:20,640
description because what they've said um

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,000
now uh 20 years ago is exactly the

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,319
description of the syndrome today which

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,920
is a combination of nausea vomiting

28
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:32,559
abdominal pain and hot water bathing

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,799
Behavior and this was among people who

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,000
had no knowledge of other people being

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,520
similarly affected so it wasn't a matter

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,239
of one person saying hey if you take a

33
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:46,199
hot shower you'll feel better so this is

34
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:51,199
associated with cycles of of nausea

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:54,680
vomiting abdominal pain um basically

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,039
abstinence from Cannabis or uh CB1

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,360
Agonist is the only effective treatment

38
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,239
but as we'll see halop par at all uh or

39
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,478
capsacin on the skin may be helpful for

40
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,758
an acute

41
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:11,239
attack prior to our study the biggest uh

42
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,000
case series was in 98 patients at the

43
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,599
Mayo Clinic uh there was a review in

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,280
2018 that

45
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:22,878
found citations about this disorder but

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,120
it's more sense uh probably the best

47
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:29,280
article on this

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,400
pathophysiology is devono in 2020 she

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,239
described a prodromal phase of nausea

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,000
and vomiting and anxiety and sweating

51
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,878
followed by the more classic hyperemesis

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,239
with all the accompanying symptoms and

53
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:49,158
then if a person abstains from Cannabis

54
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,200
uh then recovery uh there was a 2012

55
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:54,479
study uh that looked at the cost that

56
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:59,000
people had incurred between emergency

57
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:01,719
visits and diagnostic tests all for not

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,479
and that figure was 95,000 then so you

59
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:07,039
can imagine what it might be

60
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,000
now unfortunately there've been at least

61
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,798
two deaths directly attributable to this

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,239
so it wasn't cannabis that killed them

63
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,040
but the syndrome did because of

64
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,080
hyponatremia and accompanying uh

65
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:24,039
problems related to the

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,319
emesis um interestingly the standard

67
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:30,400
antiemetics the 5

68
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:33,639
ht3 antagonists like uh on Dan and

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,719
granisetron don't work here this is from

70
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,679
the devono article um and they had this

71
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,840
nice good diagram that I'm sure you

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,159
can't read um but uh again

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,200
describing possible

74
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:51,639
pathophysiology as we've heard before

75
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:55,158
canabo including THC can have basic dose

76
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:57,639
responses so everyone knows that a small

77
00:03:55,158 --> 00:04:00,959
dose of THC is good for nause and

78
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:05,479
vomiting and chemotherapy but anyone can

79
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:09,158
vomit from Cannabis if their THC uh

80
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:11,000
intake is too high um additionally if

81
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:14,399
this is done on a chronic basis there's

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,959
a down regulation of the CB1 receptor

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:22,319
where T Works and under those conditions

84
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,759
TC can act as an antagonist and again

85
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:29,519
might induce vomiting a very prominent

86
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,360
aspect of this disorder is uh activation

87
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,319
of the hypopituitary

88
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,120
hypothalamopituitary axis

89
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,439
HPA and um she had pointed out that

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,720
there could be a genetic predisposition

91
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,800
but at that time that wasn't defined and

92
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,919
this is certainly something we wanted to

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,639
do you will hear from a lot of people

94
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:54,319
that this is due to pesticides or neem

95
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,038
exposure but that's totally

96
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,639
unsubstantiated um there was this

97
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:03,199
bizarre study in

98
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:07,560
2018 so uh This was done at bellw the

99
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:11,360
big uh public Hospital in New York City

100
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,038
um and among people who didn't present

101
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,800
with CHS they asked them about their

102
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:19,240
cannabis habits uh and whether they had

103
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,120
ever vomited and whether it was better

104
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:27,319
if uh they took a hot shower um so they

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,918
created their own definition of CHS they

106
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:34,080
estimated that 33% of heavy cannabis

107
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:36,478
users might have this if you extrapolate

108
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,800
that to the US population it would be

109
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:42,959
2.75 million people affected um another

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,199
agency estimated

111
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,758
350,000 I think that the truth is

112
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,720
somewhere in

113
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,319
between um an important point in this

114
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,800
study in

115
00:05:53,319 --> 00:06:01,080
2013 there was this 30-year-old guy um

116
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,879
and he had a history of CHS based on the

117
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:07,198
symptoms he was a heavy cannabis user

118
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,399
but had a job where he had urine testing

119
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,478
so he stopped the Cannabis and this is

120
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:18,239
an unfortunate common scenario in favor

121
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:20,439
of using synthetic CB1 Agonist for which

122
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,120
they normally aren't they aren't going

123
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:26,439
to show on urine testing and he resumed

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,319
having CHS symptoms so he hadn't used

125
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:34,199
cannabis for 6 months they tested him

126
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,439
they did not see THC metabolites but did

127
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,240
see evidence of the synthetic

128
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:42,240
cannabinoids um when he quit everything

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,199
he cleared his symptoms in two weeks so

130
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,160
this shows that it is a problem with

131
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,800
Hyper stimulation over uh the long term

132
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,759
in the CB1

133
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,439
receptor now this similarly can happen

134
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,319
with Delta 8 synthetic that people are

135
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:03,800
making out of excess CBD is a way to

136
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:07,000
make money um it is weaker uh as an

137
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,879
Agonist as compared to Delta 9 but in

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,399
this uh case report this 38-year-old uh

139
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:18,639
woman um clearly uh had symptoms of CHS

140
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,719
related to delta8

141
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,519
gummies um and then this case that I

142
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,720
really question uh this is a

143
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,959
six-year-old who had uh seizures as a

144
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,039
result of an incilius

145
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:36,519
and had been on canaba as epid dialects

146
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:41,000
which is about 98% pure they're

147
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:43,959
vanishingly small amounts of THC in it

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,959
this patient had five episodes in six

149
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:51,000
months of vomiting lasting uh one to two

150
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:54,638
days uh they assumed it was

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,399
CHS um uh there was one more episode

152
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,960
after stopping and then there weren't

153
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,318
any and they decided that um

154
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,638
this was related to CBD I think that's

155
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,720
Highly Questionable we do not know if

156
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:13,199
someone took absolutely pure CBD whether

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,520
that would trigger it my suspicion is no

158
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,120
but everybody we've talked to so far has

159
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:23,560
relapsed uh and that's often because CBD

160
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,879
is rarely that pure uh particularly in

161
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,839
the current envir

162
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,280
environment um I got sick of hearing

163
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,439
that

164
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:36,000
um uh various other things were causing

165
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,279
CHS whether pesticides or nemes so I

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,759
wrote this editoral in

167
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:47,519
2021 um this guy had the crazy idea that

168
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:52,200
hop Laton vroid uh caused it despite the

169
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:55,839
fact that not only has this virus never

170
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,879
caused disease in humans no plant virus

171
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,959
has ever caused a disease in humans so

172
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:06,759
it was just a theory with nothing behind

173
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:09,879
it uh neem oil uh is an organic

174
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:12,240
pesticide you can search very carefully

175
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:16,679
in the literature and you'll barely find

176
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,200
any uh instances of toxicity from this

177
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:22,439
and the toxicity that is there is quite

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,519
distinct from CHS and that's true of its

179
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:29,480
most active ingredient is that a

180
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,039
reactant that is a very hairy molecule

181
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:36,000
you see here it's got an extremely high

182
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:39,399
boiling point of almost 800° C which is

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,958
about the temperature of a burning tip

184
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,759
of a joint so the idea that this might

185
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:46,958
be turned into something else that's

186
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,958
more toxic than as that tin itself is

187
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:53,599
really

188
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:56,518
farfetched um so another myth um and

189
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,519
this is just about pesticides pesticides

190
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,278
are a huge problem um where it's not

191
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,240
monitored properly uh in cannabis

192
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:08,759
Commerce however um you know the things

193
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,480
that they do uh like Organo phosphates

194
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:14,559
and um other agents that cause endocrine

195
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,839
disruption or potential carcinogens they

196
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:22,000
don't resemble the symptomatology of CHS

197
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:25,920
either now back to our

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,278
study um we hypothesize that this could

199
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,799
have a genetic cause and the reason for

200
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:34,200
thinking this is we we all know people

201
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,919
who use great volumes of cannabis and

202
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,480
have never had this problem whereas

203
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:43,439
others do um we thought that there might

204
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,360
be mutations on a variety of genes and

205
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:51,760
our top candidates were the CB1 Gene

206
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,440
cnr1 uh the trip V1 uh Gene that

207
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,078
responds to heat and capin that would

208
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,639
make sense uh or that it had something

209
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:03,000
to do with the the breakdown metabol IC

210
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:07,039
enzymes for cannabis particularly

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,600
THC so this could be done with genomic

212
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:13,199
testing um we had an extensive

213
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:18,120
questionnaire that was developed to make

214
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:21,320
sure that people had uh the diagnosis

215
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,399
that was active and that they had a

216
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,079
diagnosis already from someone we wanted

217
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,399
to make sure that people who hadn't been

218
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:33,439
misdiagnosed and didn't have symptoms so

219
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,919
they were eliminated uh this went

220
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,440
through an Institutional review board

221
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:43,559
and we Rec recruited over the C A year

222
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:48,120
585 patients there were

223
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:51,638
205 that had had a diagnosis of CHS and

224
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,440
had active symptoms they were um the

225
00:11:51,639 --> 00:12:00,278
ultimate study group 99 of those agreed

226
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,560
to get a a genomic test kit but this is

227
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:04,399
where it got hairy only 28 returned them

228
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,319
and

229
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,519
unfortunately this was primarily due to

230
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,800
active um

231
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:16,440
dissuasion um from some people in the

232
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,879
CHS community that questioned our

233
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,519
motives um in doing this whole thing we

234
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,679
also had 54 controls that were high

235
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,399
volume canabus users that didn't have

236
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,919
the symptoms and 12 of those agreed to

237
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,519
testing

238
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:37,719
uh like it or not this is the largest

239
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:40,278
CHS study to date um this is the uh

240
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,839
methodology of it uh if you have

241
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:45,198
questions about it uh why don't you ask

242
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,639
Kevin mckernin because he'll understand

243
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:50,679
it and I

244
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,560
don't um so survey of the the summary of

245
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,958
the

246
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:59,518
survey there were 2005 CHS patients

247
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:02,759
again high frequency users 91% daily or

248
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,879
more uh primarily using high THC

249
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:09,519
preparations especially flour and an

250
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:15,720
average of 4 grams a day which is very

251
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:18,198
high intake these days um almost 16% had

252
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,320
had a diagnosis of canab cannabis

253
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:23,679
dependency or addiction and over half it

254
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,480
had withdrawal symptoms which is it's

255
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:31,278
not that were significant to them uh

256
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,600
which is not common either uh almost 90%

257
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,958
had symptoms improve after they stopped

258
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,680
but almost all had relapsed for the

259
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:43,198
controls the use patterns were quite

260
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:47,239
similar again they'd all been recent

261
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:50,919
users 70% daily or greater and smoking

262
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,519
high THC predominant material again an

263
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:56,319
average of four grams a day so we really

264
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,440
were comparing like to

265
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,079
like um in contrast to the CHS patients

266
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,560
less than 4% had ever been labeled as

267
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:09,519
being addicted or dependent and uh 34s

268
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,078
had never had withdrawal symptoms only

269
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,240
11% have been told to stop for any

270
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:18,159
health related reasons uh just a bunch

271
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,919
of comparisons from the survey a vast

272
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:25,240
majority smoked um again 100% of of the

273
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:29,719
controls were current cannabis

274
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:33,440
smokers um and um you can't can't see it

275
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,320
very well but on the right um that's a

276
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,959
graph of daily intake and the big spike

277
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,120
is at 4

278
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:45,159
grams um do you know the composition of

279
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:49,360
the Cannabis that you use and uh for the

280
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:53,078
vast majority it was the blue is uh Tec

281
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,480
predominant um is your use of cannabis

282
00:14:53,078 --> 00:15:03,439
adult use um again the bluish purple

283
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:08,399
there um uh 6% purely medical and 38%

284
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:12,399
both um use patterns um I can't even

285
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,399
read the captions

286
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:23,000
um uh again treated for dependency or

287
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:25,279
addiction uh the ma majority of the CHS

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,839
patients and

289
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,559
um have you ever had to stop for a

290
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,399
health reason

291
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:35,958
um again the majority of the

292
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,198
patients um withdrawal 3/4 of the

293
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:41,198
controls had never had

294
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:41,198
withdrawal

295
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,240
um these were symptoms of withdrawal

296
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,198
anxiety um difficulty with sleep the

297
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,399
things that you would imagine in any

298
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,240
other

299
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,318
context

300
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,039
uh periodic nausea and vomiting and this

301
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:02,879
is how happen often it happened for many

302
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:05,240
people it was daily weekly Etc that

303
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,919
figure was Zero for

304
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,399
controls um hospitalizations for nausea

305
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:15,159
again the vast majority of the CHS

306
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,958
patients that figure was also zero for

307
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,639
the

308
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:23,838
controls um and abdominal pain same

309
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:26,360
thing everyone uh of the CHS patients

310
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,160
had uh severe abdominal pain and none of

311
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,440
the

312
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:34,639
controls uh how often often again

313
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,680
varying from daily to weekly or

314
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:41,318
episodically

315
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,318
um and let's just go ahead

316
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:56,399
here uh episodes are lasting anywhere

317
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,120
from days to months at a time it would

318
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,000
really depend on whether people were

319
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,440
continuing to use

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,480
cannabis uh did the condition improve

321
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,679
after cessation of cannabis usage uh the

322
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,679
vast majority

323
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,759
yes um after a period of abstinence did

324
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,798
the symptoms resume again a vast

325
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:27,160
majority that was true and how long it

326
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:30,079
took uh really was a function of

327
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,798
cannabis usage I can just say in general

328
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,319
that when people start back often they

329
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:38,960
do so gingerly and may not have a

330
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,759
problem the problem will occur with dose

331
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,519
escalation or at a point that they

332
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:47,038
develop tolerance um

333
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,839
again uh this one was interesting do you

334
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,879
have an opinion is the cause of

335
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,240
cannaboid hyperemesis syndrome couple of

336
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,960
people thought it might be genetic a

337
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,599
couple of people didn't think that they

338
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:03,038
believed in the diagnosis uh 6 % thought

339
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:06,240
it was related to neem or

340
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:09,519
pesticides um this is a chart on the

341
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,798
demographic comparison in both instances

342
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,359
there were more women than men I don't

343
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:16,440
think that's typical of the demographics

344
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:19,038
in the actual population it's just that

345
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,840
women are more patient to fill out a

346
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:27,400
long questionnaire and engage in a study

347
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:32,959
um and uh you see again a smoking habit

348
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:35,280
uh 86% daily consumers and CHS and 70%

349
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,159
in the control subjects the big

350
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:43,079
difference came in symptoms of abdominal

351
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:48,320
pain nausea Etc uh so high figures for

352
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,319
CHS and zero for uh the

353
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:55,038
controls this thing is hesitant now

354
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,359
again this may be hard to read but we

355
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,200
looked uh specifically at a number of

356
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,199
different genes

357
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,038
and we'll go into each of these in

358
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,319
detail but bottom line is there were

359
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:10,200
five genes where there were mutations in

360
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:12,599
the CHS patients that were statistically

361
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,120
significantly different than the

362
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,119
controls that didn't have

363
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,759
CHS uh the first hypothesized Gene was

364
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:26,480
cnr1 that encodes for the CB1 receptor

365
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:28,679
where THC works now in Prior studies

366
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,159
there have been Snips single nucle

367
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,320
nucleotide

368
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:35,320
polymorphisms that were associated with

369
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:38,079
cannabis usage but we didn't see that in

370
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:41,200
the CHS patients now this is an

371
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,960
important point of Distinction because

372
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,279
there is this thing called cyclic

373
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,759
vomiting syndrome that is distinct from

374
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:53,158
CHS sounds alike this is a form Frost of

375
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,440
migraine it often will begin in a child

376
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,360
who has episodes of vomiting for no

377
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,640
apparent reason has a family history of

378
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:03,479
mind Rin and only when they're older

379
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,320
teen or even adult will they develop

380
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,798
more classic hemicranial pain nausea

381
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:16,200
vomiting and um and sensitivity of the

382
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:20,400
eyes to light um so this test could form

383
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,759
a distinction between um CVS cyclic

384
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,159
vomiting syndrome where cannabis helps

385
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:30,079
uh and CHS where cannabis

386
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,679
hurts um

387
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,079
and there was unfortunately um

388
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,720
gastroenterology just uh published this

389
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,199
opinion piece that made me crazy uh

390
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,480
Bonnie sent it to me and she'll tell you

391
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:48,279
what my reaction was but they

392
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,200
conflated uh CHS with CVS saying they're

393
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,359
subsets of one another or something um

394
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,080
and they said it right here CHS is a

395
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,240
subtype of cyclic vomiting syndrome this

396
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,000
is a really dangerous and inaccurate

397
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,000
state statement um my letter to the

398
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,319
editor has been submitted we'll see if

399
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,400
they bother to print it okay

400
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:13,960
so one theory was wrong but still

401
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,080
helpful um we didn't know anything about

402
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,159
this one this wasn't something we

403
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:24,000
hypothesized but this is CT ketol methyl

404
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:27,760
transfer Gene that breaks down uh

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,880
dopamine so the um there was a mutation

406
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:38,038
on this Gene and 57% of the CHS patients

407
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:41,120
and only um uh very 10% of controls you

408
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:42,960
can see the P value is significant um

409
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,519
when there's a loss of function in this

410
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,240
Gene it leads to dopamine excess which

411
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:53,400
can lead to Compulsive Behavior like

412
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,839
gambling sex addiction or substance use

413
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,640
um this particular mutation has also

414
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,599
been associated with depression

415
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,960
rumination behavior and

416
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:07,558
alcoholism um so these are risk factors

417
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,480
for the same population and um we've

418
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,759
come to know a lot of patients who are

419
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,640
affected and they tend to have other

420
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:18,440
substance abuse problems it's also been

421
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,240
associated with impulsivity attention

422
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,278
deficit obsessive compulsive disorder

423
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,839
anxiety and psychosis so again risk

424
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:30,278
factors um one of the genes we did

425
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:34,839
hypothesize is being involved wasn't in

426
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:38,400
fact the case this is trip V1 for the um

427
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:39,879
that receptor um the this mutation was

428
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,320
in

429
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:47,960
71.5% of the CHS patients and only 30%

430
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:51,079
of controls trip V1 um does a lot of

431
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,038
different stuff it is it present in the

432
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:56,240
gut it's present in the

433
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,278
brain it mediates long-term depression

434
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,919
in the hippocampus it can controls

435
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:05,640
glutamate release in the solitary tract

436
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:09,520
that affects gut motility and

437
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,679
secretion um in a prior study no

438
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,119
mutations on this Gene were seen in

439
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,240
cannabis dependency but they may not

440
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:19,278
have been dealing with CHS patients um

441
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,599
this was a new mutation that wasn't

442
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:24,119
previously Le listed in the

443
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:27,639
databases uh but this really suggests a

444
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:30,798
linkage to mood and the gut phenomena of

445
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,960
CHS as well as the hot water bathing

446
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:38,200
because that will stimulate trip v b V1

447
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,480
also explains why capsacin on the skin

448
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,600
will help the other one that we

449
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,519
hypothesized was again metabolic enzymes

450
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:47,599
for

451
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,200
THC uh so

452
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:54,199
cyp2c9 as we heard from Bonnie yesterday

453
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,000
is the main uh enzyme that breaks down

454
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,080
uh

455
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,599
THC um and in this instance there was a

456
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:05,480
homo zy zygus mutation two two copies

457
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,678
that was seen in almost half of the CHS

458
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,278
patients and only 10% of

459
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,640
controls um so this breaks down a bunch

460
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:15,759
of other things including uh erodic acid

461
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,159
the precursor to

462
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:21,519
anandamide when it this enzyme is not

463
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:25,200
functioning properly it could lead to

464
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:28,079
THC accumulation and maybe kick it into

465
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,120
that range where it's protic rather than

466
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,839
anti getic it's also possible that

467
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,000
because the enzyme is screwy that it

468
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,119
could make abnormal metabolites that

469
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,038
could be

470
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:46,239
toxic um previously there was one case

471
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:47,640
report of a mutation on cyp uh c19 along

472
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,679
with two

473
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:54,480
2c9 on that patient had CHS also

474
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,679
dependency and a personality

475
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,640
disorder um next we we found another uh

476
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,240
dopamine Gene and this is the one that

477
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,200
codes for the D2 dopamine receptor

478
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,519
that's the target of most antipsychotic

479
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:13,960
drugs so 61% of the CHS patients had the

480
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:18,359
mutation and only 20% of the

481
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:22,038
controls stimulants of the drd2 are

482
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:25,599
protic and also affect gut M motility so

483
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:28,038
this fits well as well uh again

484
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,278
depression and anxiety go along with

485
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:35,480
this mutation also has been associated

486
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:38,440
with cigarette addiction uh Tourette

487
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:42,519
syndrome and chronic pain the fact that

488
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,240
we've got a two genes affecting dopamine

489
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:49,278
metabolism really helps explain the

490
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:52,880
symptoms of CHS and also the psychiatric

491
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,960
sequel that seem to accompany it um and

492
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,520
the last one was again something we

493
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,038
hadn't predicted the abca1 ATP bind

494
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,359
cassette

495
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:08,879
transporter again a homo zygous mutation

496
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:11,278
two copies in 68% of CHS and only 20% of

497
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,039
controls this is a gene affecting

498
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,839
cholesterol met and

499
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:20,480
phospholipid balance it's also

500
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:24,639
associated with apoe accumulation and a

501
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,720
beta deposition and Alzheimer disease so

502
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,799
having two copies of this would place

503
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,600
people at risk for a bunch of things

504
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:36,158
including dementia later in life um also

505
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:38,879
coronary artery disease and type two two

506
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,440
diabetes polymorphisms in a closely

507
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,399
related Gene were also associated with

508
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,880
cannabis

509
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:49,798
dependency so conclusions we found five

510
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,760
mutations with plausible ideologic roles

511
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:55,038
in the phenomenology of cannabinoid

512
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,960
hyperemesis syndrome that was

513
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,558
statistically significantly different

514
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,759
from high volume canab I AB users that

515
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:05,960
didn't have the the problems we feel

516
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,679
that this battery represents this

517
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:14,278
Greening test that could uh reduce costs

518
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:17,840
and uh fruitless searches uh for other

519
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:19,919
causes of this um I'll just read this

520
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,959
from the paper cannabinoid hyperemesis

521
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,240
syndrome can contemporaneously be

522
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,798
conceived of not as a functional

523
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,079
gastrointestinal disorder but rather as

524
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,879
a manifestation of gen environment

525
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:34,918
interaction in a rare genetic disease

526
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,200
unmasked by a toxic reaction to

527
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:41,120
excessive THC

528
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:45,319
exposure um these are links we have a

529
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:48,639
website what Dash is-

530
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:48,639
cs.com what is

531
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:58,278
chs.cc also a link to the test if you

532
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:02,970
would want to order this for someone and

533
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:07,420
and we have nine seconds thank you

534
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,420
[Applause]
