00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,599
[Music]

2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:15,320
with that said Ed what inspired you to

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,480
create high science specifically about

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,359
cannabis and why

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,240
now you know uh back in

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:26,560
2018 I had acoustic Noma surgery and if

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,320
anybody knows what that is that's a a

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:33,878
tumor in the brain uh that's connected

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,960
to uh your basically everything and

10
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:37,878
after surgery I spent 33 days in ICU and

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,520
had some

12
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:46,280
issues uh and the medicine I was on I

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,920
did not like uh I also believed when

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,799
they did the the surgery was I don't

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,198
know 10 12 hours whatever it was uh they

16
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:59,038
said it was easier to remove it was more

17
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:02,000
cystlike uh than the tumor uh and I

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,799
believe that when I found out I had this

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,599
this uh problem I just smoked a lot of

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,400
weed because I heard uh it was great for

21
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,640
cancer and tumors and blah blah blah the

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,600
list goes on so I smoked a lot of weed

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,599
and uh I believe that's what made it uh

24
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:22,280
easier to remove the doctor doesn't

25
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:26,078
think so but that's medical versus a

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,478
cannabis guy and uh I had this idea for

27
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:31,839
a show and because I wanted other people

28
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:35,879
to understand what cannabis was all

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,359
about uh and managed to through a friend

30
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,239
meet uh the infamous David mckellop uh

31
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,039
who's now my partner and I don't know

32
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,959
what I would do without him uh I think

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,280
we make a great team uh and he asked me

34
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:53,078
do you really think uh we could do this

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,039
and I said I do David and he goes who's

36
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:57,359
going to own the IP and I said you and I

37
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,200
uh we're not going to sell it to a

38
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,599
network uh we're going to do everything

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,280
ourself

40
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:07,280
and he said let's go uh he comes from

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:12,239
the television world and uh we sat out

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,199
on a road to find the most

43
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,000

this show is going to be great not only

59

62
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,518
background and what got you involved in

63
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,798
the project you know I'm I'm a I've

64
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,439
spent most of my life as a television

65
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,959
programmer I've headed up uh programming

66
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:21,039
departments at the National Geographic

67
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,199
Discovery Channel uh history A&amp;E I ran

68
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,878
A&amp;E as the general manager um so I've

69
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:30,598
spent most of my life producing programs

70
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:35,639
um everything from uh Deadliest Catch at

71
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:40,039
Discovery to Storage Wars Pawn Stars and

72
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:42,119
uh Duck Dynasty at history and A&amp;E um so

73
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:46,438
I you know i' I've been doing this most

74
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:50,080
of my life um when I met Ed you know I

75
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:52,639
had I kind of left the network you know

76
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,159
you you you can't program a you have

77
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,238
there's a certain limit to what you can

78
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,438
do in terms of your age and everything

79
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,599
so it's time to let the other people

80
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:05,799
come in in program but I had a great run

81
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,518
and loved what I was doing um and you

82
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,159
know I was looking for my next thing so

83
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,079
when Ed approached me I was skeptical to

84
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,560
be quite honest with you you know to me

85
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,280
it was like oh you know am I

86
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,199
allowed to say that um is that

87
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,359
um that um I'm not gonna just sit here

88
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,960
and do some kind of Stoner show you know

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,639
that's just not what I smoked the I

90
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,478
smoked some weed when I was a kid in

91
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,360
fact we when I was growing up we

92
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,758
actually smoked weed we didn't really

93
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,080
drink I never even drank until after

94
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,840
college um but anyway I started to meet

95
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,680
some of the people Ed had rounded up in

96
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,560
this group and I started to do some

97
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,079
research and I suddenly realized

98
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,680
wow um people's perception of the

99
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:56,399
Cannabis industry is still squarely in

100
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,400
this idea of a of a recreational drug

101
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,758
and the government and big

102
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:04,519
pharmaceutical companies would love to

103
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,759
have you think that but what we soon

104
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:09,000
discovered where Ed had shown some light

105
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,600
and I did some Discovery is that quite

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,680
the opposite I mean up prior to the to

107
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,600
World War II cannabis was the go-to

108
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,478
treatment for up to a hundred different

109
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,160
alements it was also the main treatment

110
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,159
for pain before aspirin so we began to

111
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,160
discover that the relationship of human

112
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,360
evolution and cannabis evolution is

113
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,680
tightly bound and it's somehow gotten

114
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,120
lost you know I have my theories on why

115
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,280
a lot of it probably is people don't

116
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,720
have patents on it and been trying to

117
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,719
make a lot of money off of it but anyway

118
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,319
so I thought you know what I'll take

119
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
this I'll take this on you know we

120
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,280
didn't have a lot of

121
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,198
money uh but we had a lot of passion and

122
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,918
someone like Ed and we met some of the

123
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,319
people and the characters in the show

124
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,318
and we worked hard and we all chipped in

125
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,080
we didn't weren you know we weren't

126
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:09,360
paid this was kind of a uh it became a

127
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:11,800
passion for me and um because I know how

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,520
many people can benefit from it and the

129
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,319
most important thing is is that people

130
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,359
there been lots of stories about people

131
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,039
overdoing it or going into emergency

132
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,479
rooms and that's because there there's

133
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:26,038
no information there's no one there's no

134
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,079
trusted source of information the

135
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,560
government doesn't want to tell you

136
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:30,240
anything pharmaceutical companies don't

137
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,079
want to tell you anything so people are

138
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,478
basically finding out for themselves how

139
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,560
many gummies it takes and that's a

140
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:40,639
disaster you know an

141
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,360
uneducated population is not going to

142
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,000
really be able to fully Embrace what

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,840
cannabis can do for the human body and

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,478
since no one else is going to do it Ed

145
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,239
and I decided that we're going to do it

146
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,318
and the first step in this was to create

147
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,519
the high science TV show which is going

148
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,000
to be an anthology Series so this first

149
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,198
series is we're following a a family of

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,360
investors but our

151
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,598
third uh we could be doing something

152
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,240
totally different but the goal here is

153
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,199
to educate people at the same time and

154
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,960
have a and have a lot of fun so that's

155
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,960
how I kind of got involved in it

156
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,959
excellent

157
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:26,830
