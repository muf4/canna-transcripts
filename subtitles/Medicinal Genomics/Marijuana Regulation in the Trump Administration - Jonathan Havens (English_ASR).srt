1
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:10,059
good morning everyone I'm not sure

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,879
what's worse from the East Coast or I'm

3
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:16,058
an attorney I'm I'm wearing a tie which

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,469
I know is uh might be forbidden with

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,789
this group but you know if I wasn't

6
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:19,500
wearing a tie maybe you wouldn't take me

7
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,390
seriously

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,109
so I'm gonna be talking this morning

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:28,179
about cannabis regulation I know most

10
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,219
people in this room want to talk about

11
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:32,590
breakthroughs and talk about what the

12
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:34,628
potentials of this wonder plant are and

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,609
I'm not here to rain on that parade but

14
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:38,890
my job and what I do with my clients is

15
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:41,018
I look at what are the regulations how

16
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,870
do you get licenses to grow process and

17
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:46,299
dispense cannabis how do you transport

18
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:48,308
investigational drugs across state lines

19
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:49,779
obviously this is still federally

20
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:51,518
illegal in the United States and so

21
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,819
talking about regulation is necessary

22
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:56,108
unfortunately but hopefully you know

23
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:57,670
with my background and the things that

24
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,890
I've looked at I can come up with

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,929
creative solutions and and interesting

26
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:08,079
ways to look at these issues so here we

27
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:09,640
go so you're you all have copies or

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,109
we'll have a copy of my slide deck I

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,790
want to leave time for questions so I'm

30
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:14,828
gonna go through this pretty quickly I

31
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,240
know it's very common at conferences for

32
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:17,978
people to take pictures of slides I have

33
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,408
no problem if you do that if you email

34
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:22,030
me I'm happy to email you a copy of my

35
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:25,109
deck directly so you don't have to take

36
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:28,239
pictures but it's completely up to you

37
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:30,099
so look I think most people in this room

38
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,809
understand what the regulatory status of

39
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,188
cannabis is but but let's just briefly

40
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,780
talk about it for those of you who are

41
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:37,629
new to this Basin to make sure we're all

42
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,099
on the same page so 31 states depending

43
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:40,839
on how you do the count and the District

44
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,519
of Columbia have some sort of a medical

45
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,039
program what I'll call a functioning

46
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,658
medical marijuana program the nine of

47
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,519
those states also have recreational

48
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:50,469
programs again people dispute these

49
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:52,718
counts but nine and thirty one are

50
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:54,309
generally agreed to the District of

51
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:55,928
Columbia has this interesting program

52
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,429
called a gifting program you can't

53
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:58,840
actually go and buy recreational

54
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:02,498
cannabis in DC but if you buy a t-shirt

55
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,469
for $50 you could be gifted cannabis go

56
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:07,179
go figure the prospects of that there

57
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:10,840
absolutely no no possibility for

58
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:12,909
confusion so states are establishing

59
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,158
these programs every day and before you

60
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:17,709
think that it's just what you consider

61
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:18,709
to be liberal states Oklahoma just

62
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,960
passed our

63
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,310
random and has a lot of people are

64
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,469
interested in getting these licenses

65
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,920
Utah it's on their ballot for this fall

66
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,870
this is not a red state blue state issue

67
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:32,059
so those who think about this is a

68
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,530
Republican Democrat old young male

69
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,710
female issue do so at their own peril

70
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,110
the demographics cut across every

71
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,790
different line so don't just get lazy

72
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,890
and think that you can assume that a

73
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:45,169
state doesn't have a program because the

74
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:47,149
fact is the majority of states do have

75
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:49,159
programs and probably after the upcoming

76
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:53,000
election will there be more to that

77
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,859
number so when I first wrote this slide

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,409
it says President Trump on marijuana I

79
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,380
wasn't trying to be cute I'm talking

80
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:03,109
about president Trump's positions on on

81
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,609
cannabis but if you think I was trying

82
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,950
to be funny then then I guess I'll take

83
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,450
credit for that so we actually don't

84
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:10,549
know very much about what the

85
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,769
president's positions are on cannabis he

86
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,480
obviously said or not so obviously but

87
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,260
as some of you might know he said on the

88
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,879
campaign trail

89
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:20,599
that's a states rights issue I'm not

90
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,599
gonna interfere he did issue the signing

91
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,099
statement with the omnes omnibus bill so

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,049
there's these omnibus bills because

93
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:29,120
Congress unlike when I worked on Capitol

94
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,860
Hill years and years ago getting

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,509
standalone spending bills done err are

96
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,000
completely impossible now so they do

97
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:37,159
these mega omnibus sometimes called

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,219
Christmas tree bills and a bunch of

99
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,099
things get stuffed under the tree so in

100
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:44,449
any event he issued this signing

101
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,889
statement essentially said I'm reserving

102
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:46,639
my right to do what I want to enforce

103
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:49,659
federal law

104
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,939
thanks very helpful to give us your your

105
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:55,219
position on cannabis so Tom angel who

106
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,359
has this daily newsletter that if you're

107
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,129
not reading it I think it's pretty

108
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,650
worthwhile I read it every morning among

109
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,909
many other publications said my read is

110
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,230
that he's basically reserving the right

111
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:07,759
to do whatever he wants which is what I

112
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:09,530
just said by the way I go over overboard

113
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,870
in putting links and sources in my

114
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,240
presentations this is for a few reasons

115
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,639
one because I'm a nervous lawyer it's

116
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,710
you know some cya but also and more

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,939
importantly it's so you can all see what

118
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,219
I'm reading and the answer is I'm

119
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,360
reading a lot of things and to keep up

120
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,310
with developments in the space you need

121
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,990
to read a lot of different sources also

122
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,600
a lot of people report things

123
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,009
incorrectly and so checking two or three

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,850
or four different sources is probably a

125
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:33,620
good idea

126
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,360
so again President Trump said on the

127
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,980
campaign trail that's I'm gonna leave to

128
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,449
the states fine recently after Jeff

129
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,950
Sessions worse into what's known as the

130
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,680
Kohl memorandum and we'll get back to

131
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,089
what that is Cory Gardner senator from

132
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,310
Colorado said all right you're gonna

133
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,349
you're going to encroach on states

134
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,790
rights in the cannabis space I'm going

135
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,950
to put a hold on every department of

136
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,819
justice nominee it worked for a while

137
00:04:54,949 --> 00:05:00,439
and then Cory Gardner made I think what

138
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:03,500
Trump would say if she's talking about

139
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:06,050
it was a bad deal Cory Gardner basically

140
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,790
pulled his hold on these nominations for

141
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,129
Trump support of a bill that didn't yet

142
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,590
exist on his desk I thought it was I

143
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,509
thought Gardner had a pretty good a good

144
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:15,919
point on holding the DOJ nominees he was

145
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:20,089
pretty bold on it but he gave up a

146
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,770
little too early in my opinion so there

147
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,839
are some pieces of legislation there's

148
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:26,870
this Warren Gardner piece of legislation

149
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,699
the state's act which would make more

150
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,290
permanent what Rohrabacher Bloom an hour

151
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,729
does that amendment that I was talking

152
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,379
to about these major spending bills that

153
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,030
basically says if you're in compliance

154
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:36,829
with your state laws that the feds

155
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:38,089
usually won't go after you though

156
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,919
although there's a number of exceptions

157
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:42,049
to that in the interest of time I'm

158
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,670
shortchanging this I assure you there

159
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,930
are many more details a lot of this but

160
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,870
I'm not gonna bore you with those right

161
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,120
now so I talked about the Cole

162
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,009
memorandum this was a very very

163
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,430
important piece of guidance from the

164
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,750
Obama administration that essentially

165
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,400
said if you're in compliance with your

166
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,139
state's programs your state medical

167
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,459
marijuana programs the feds will not go

168
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,349
after you there are enforcement

169
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:05,629
priorities if you cross state lines you

170
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,160
divert to youth a number of different

171
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:08,659
things then we reserve the right to go

172
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,870
after you because of course this is all

173
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,300
federally illegal still I might be

174
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,209
splitting hairs but you'll hear people

175
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,670
say you know California legalized

176
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:21,799
recreational marijuana no California

177
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,900
authorized people to grow process and

178
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,939
dispense recreational marijuana in

179
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,679
California it's still federally illegal

180
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:29,689
in the feds could technically still come

181
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,000
in and say you can't do this we all know

182
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,110
that that's pretty unlikely as long as

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,480
you're not violating one of these

184
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,310
enforcement priorities so this was a

185
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,050
major shift in drug policy it was very

186
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,180
helpful this helped the proliferation of

187
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,310
the state cannabis industry and then on

188
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,810
January 4th Jeff Sessions woke up and

189
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,649
said no I don't like that so I'm gonna

190
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,649
rescind it

191
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:50,029
in a very perverse way I'm somewhat

192
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:53,299
thankful that he did and I'll tell you

193
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:55,519
why it has never motivated more action

194
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,600
on Capitol Hill and made members of

195
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,689
Congress put their money where their

196
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,129
mouth is the proliferation of cannabis

197
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:02,870
friendly legislation on Capitol Hill

198
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,879
although most of it ultimately

199
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:09,680
unsuccessful or getting stuck in

200
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:11,240
committee has has flourished and so jeff

201
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,949
sessions this is like a strict

202
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,210
constructionist view of the world he's

203
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,069
essentially saying this isn't law

204
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:17,810
congress if you want this to be law you

205
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,060
need to make it law so he rescinded the

206
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,478
Cole memo the impact on the industry has

207
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,589
has not been that quantifiable I think

208
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:27,139
the industry is continued to flourish

209
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:29,000
maybe some CEOs of these cannabis

210
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,439
companies are a little bit more worried

211
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,699
at night but generally speaking

212
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:37,699
enforcement has not been much greater so

213
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,919
again you'll hear a lot in the headlines

214
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,870
about oh the the Cole memo was rescinded

215
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,969
so Jeff sessions actually rescinded

216
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,079
several policies on January 4th it's

217
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,820
important to know what all these

218
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,349
policies are it's also important to

219
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,139
understand how these policies interplay

220
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,150
with one another for example FinCEN

221
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,560
which is the Financial Crimes

222
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:56,538
enforcement network of the Department of

223
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,060
the Treasury who has the cannabis

224
00:07:56,538 --> 00:08:01,788
banking memorandum that banking

225
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,728
memorandum which allows some banks or

226
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:07,430
give some banks some comfort to bank

227
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:09,139
cannabis that memo is based on the Cole

228
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,220
memo so a lot of people are afraid well

229
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,240
now that the Cole memo has been

230
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,760
rescinded what's going to happen in the

231
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,228
fins end memo secretary minuchin from

232
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,959
the Treasury Department has said it's on

233
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:19,339
Treasury's list of things to do some

234
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,379
have said that they're going to rescind

235
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:22,609
their memo altogether not clear but

236
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,870
again it's important to understand the

237
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,970
interplay between these things and I

238
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,500
know that regulations are not what a lot

239
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,020
of you want to think about or even think

240
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,719
about this early in the day but you

241
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,759
realize how important a role these

242
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,860
regulations play and that's you know

243
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,059
what what I do on a day-to-day basis is

244
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,879
I look at these things and figure out

245
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,439
how they actually impact the industry so

246
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,969
I'm not gonna get into that slide was

247
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,010
his move with sessions move to rescind

248
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,089
the Cole memo surprising it wasn't if

249
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:50,569
you read any of his quotes he's

250
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:52,130
obviously not a fan of cannabis again

251
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,720
you can read all these quotes they're

252
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:55,370
more entertaining than anything else I

253
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,129
don't think they're super helpful but it

254
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,149
goes to show you what do jays positions

255
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:01,879
are on

256
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,500
at least the head of the DOJ so

257
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,639
interestingly enough though Jeff

258
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,559
sessions said there should be more

259
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,769
competition for growers who are growing

260
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,239
for research purposes okay

261
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:16,730
thanks that's that's very helpful

262
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,399
appreciate that so again if you look at

263
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,190
Jeff Sessions the lazy part of it is the

264
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,100
lazy approaches he's anti cannabis great

265
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,900
that's not helpful you know if you put

266
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,480
policies in front of this administration

267
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,399
that are tenable from there some of

268
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,560
their strict constructionist small

269
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,750
government view I think some of these

270
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,689
have a likelihood of passing and getting

271
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,009
through but again it's Congress that

272
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:45,860
needs to make the first move on a lot of

273
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:47,299
these things so okay what does it mean

274
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,039
when Jeff sessions worsens the Cole memo

275
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:50,750
well what it means is that US Attorney's

276
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,309
around the country have a lot more

277
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,809
discretion and so you need to be paying

278
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:56,149
attention to what US attorneys in your

279
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:57,799
gener your respective jurisdictions are

280
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,600
saying I have some reports here from

281
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,000
Colorado in California in Massachusetts

282
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,670
because obviously those are in a robust

283
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,620
areas in this space

284
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:08,149
public opinion I mean my time is is

285
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,029
winding down and I again want to leave

286
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:16,539
time for questions but again if you

287
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:19,279
assume that this is a young appro

288
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:22,789
millennial issue or you assume this is a

289
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,289
Pro Democrat issue you're wrong and

290
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,079
you're you're making that mistake at

291
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:28,459
your own peril as as a lot of

292
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,410
entrepreneurial politicians have

293
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,230
realized marijuana sells the ballot box

294
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:37,069
and that's because public opinion is so

295
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,500
high no pun intended on cannabis so I

296
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,780
would just mention to you that before

297
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,830
you go out there and assume that you

298
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,750
shouldn't be targeting to one

299
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,480
demographic or shouldn't be including

300
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,529
one demographic in a clinical study you

301
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,240
should you should take a look at the

302
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:52,669
numbers I don't think anybody in this

303
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,919
room is is doing that but I just go to

304
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:57,799
say that the numbers are staggering

305
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,409
public opinion support for some form of

306
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:03,469
a medical program what I mean by that is

307
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:05,299
access to medical metus medicinal

308
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,350
marijuana for people that need it not

309
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,909
necessarily for the people who are

310
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,310
answering the polling questions some of

311
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:11,179
those polls are up as high as 90% so

312
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,359
again

313
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,278
the numbers are staggering

314
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,839
talked about marijuana at the ballot box

315
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:17,338
I look forward to updating this slide

316
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,720
and in a few short weeks I think it's

317
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,720
gonna win big again at the ballot box

318
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,839
any of you who are in or are in or have

319
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:30,570
been in the cannabis space be that in a

320
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,490
national operator be that a clinical

321
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,800
researcher you know what these issues

322
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,329
are but these are kind of the hopefully

323
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,588
I can go for in the back yeah these are

324
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,509
the big six issues that I'll call

325
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:43,290
attention to and these are all because

326
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:45,629
of the schedule one status of cannabis I

327
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:47,458
will get to and I'm not gonna steal

328
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:50,328
Alice meets thunder from G to uw

329
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:52,979
pharmaceuticals but we can no longer say

330
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:55,789
blanket statement that there are no

331
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,430
drugs derived from cannabis that are

332
00:11:55,789 --> 00:12:01,799
solely in schedule one I didn't say that

333
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:03,919
so succinctly in any event cannabis is

334
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,870
still schedule one there is one

335
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,309
fda-approved drug epidemic GW

336
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,629
Pharmaceuticals drug which was approved

337
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:12,750
over the summer and just scheduled by

338
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,789
DEA a few weeks ago a schedule 5 but

339
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,549
cannabis generally and it's actually

340
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:19,139
marijuana with an H for reasons I can't

341
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:20,789
explain to you under the Controlled

342
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,620
Substances Act which is still schedule

343
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:24,679
one so don't read any of these new

344
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,149
headlines that say after the great news

345
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,679
at e GW Pharmaceuticals that their

346
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:31,039
product got approved first cannabis

347
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:35,189
derived drug that was approved by FDA

348
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:37,500
cannabis is not D scheduled epidural X

349
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,269
is not in schedule one it's in schedule

350
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,299
five it's important to understand the

351
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:45,120
differences here largely speaking

352
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:47,278
cannabis schedule one so what does that

353
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,600
mean it makes it hard to Bank makes it

354
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,820
hard to get intellectual property

355
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,399
protection mostly on the trademark side

356
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,140
there's a ton of cannabis intellectual

357
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,759
property and patents now the US

358
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,088
government holds a number of them go

359
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,578
figure

360
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,680
real estate getting willing landlords

361
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:05,309
getting towns do not block your zoning

362
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,278
very difficult as I'm sure those of you

363
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:10,289
who have tried to get licensed in states

364
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,879
know you get a license you work really

365
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,588
hard you spend a lot of money your team

366
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,809
pours over an application for months and

367
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:19,140
months if you get that long some states

368
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:21,239
like New Jersey give you 30 days and you

369
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,610
you go to site your property and the

370
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,169
local town says nope we're gonna make it

371
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,220
very difficult for you to establish your

372
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,559
business you can't be with

373
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,810
than a thousand yards of a daycare a

374
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,539
thousand yards of a school 1,500 yards

375
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,949
of a house of worship you realize that

376
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:36,329
there aren't a lot of places to put your

377
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,060
business that anyone would want to come

378
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:42,090
visit you so in any event that makes it

379
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:45,599
very difficult tax deductions

380
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:48,090
I'm sure the IRS is the bane of many

381
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,620
folks in this room existence as some of

382
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,389
you know the effective tax rate for a

383
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,560
lot of businesses in this space without

384
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:57,720
effective planning can be in the 70s you

385
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,279
know taking deductions for normal things

386
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,320
in the cannabis business are a lot

387
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,409
harder because again sound like a broken

388
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,970
record it's federally illegal direct

389
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:08,959
profits are derived from you know an

390
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,879
illegal source so again careful planning

391
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,290
getting a CPA firm that this is not

392
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,299
their first foray into the cannabis

393
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:17,069
space getting tax attorneys and

394
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,709
regulatory attorneys to understand this

395
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,660
is important whether you hire us or not

396
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,370
I don't really care but I would advise

397
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:25,079
you to hire someone who knows what

398
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,539
they're doing I'd love to talk to you if

399
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,320
you you're interested drug testing and

400
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:30,929
discrimination

401
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,930
this is very interesting so you would

402
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:37,129
think that if someone has a medical card

403
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:39,989
that if they test positive at work for

404
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:42,840
you know for marijuana screen they

405
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,180
couldn't get fired not the case in a lot

406
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,649
of states you can still fire someone or

407
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,599
refuse to hire them if they fail a drug

408
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,669
test even if they have a medical card

409
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,290
now I'm not talking about being under

410
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:53,879
the influence and crashing a forklift

411
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:57,059
into the side of a factory you know

412
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,230
that's a for-cause type of investigation

413
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,479
I'm not an employment attorney but

414
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,950
there's a difference between being under

415
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,990
the influence at work which I think any

416
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,660
employer in the right mind would

417
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,310
prohibit but there's what I'm talking

418
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,620
about is failing a drug test not being

419
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:12,419
under the influence and there are just a

420
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,100
couple of states Massachusetts I know is

421
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,240
one of them Massachusetts there is a

422
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,310
court decision last year that

423
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,460
essentially said you can't fire someone

424
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:22,049
or refuse to hire someone simply based

425
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,080
on a failed drug test if they have a

426
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:27,089
medical card so again a lot of nuance is

427
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,600
a lot of caveats but you should know the

428
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,250
laws in your states so those who think

429
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,470
it's easy to get a state license I would

430
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,659
encourage you to look at this slide this

431
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,430
is just the the headings of the

432
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:40,088
application in Pennsylvania to get

433
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:42,219
licensed to be

434
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,199
leave this is a growing agro process

435
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,569
application these applications are a

436
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,669
thousand pages they are incredibly

437
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:50,860
difficult you get very little guidance I

438
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,969
don't know if those of you or you know

439
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,379
used to dealing with Department of

440
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,120
Health where you call and you get put on

441
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:57,670
hold and you know you eventually get to

442
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,230
somebody I'll give you an example from

443
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:01,568
the state of Maryland where I where I

444
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,370
practice and do a lot of work you cannot

445
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:05,019
even call the state medical cannabis

446
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,429
commission and get a live person you

447
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:07,629
have to submit something in writing and

448
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:10,328
you're lucky if you get something back

449
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:11,829
in 30 to 60 days that's gotten a little

450
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:13,539
bit better now that the first licenses

451
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:15,489
are out but good luck getting a live

452
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:18,938
answer when your applications are due

453
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:21,519
which which causes things like people

454
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:23,110
having the platforms to submit their

455
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,818
applications crash and have no recourse

456
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,370
and then their applications are not

457
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,628
accepted so again it's a problem to not

458
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,549
be able to reach people and this is

459
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:32,639
again that's just the headings of the

460
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,558
application they're very cumbersome

461
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,100
talked about Rohrabacher bloom an hour

462
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:41,259
my time is running short very very quick

463
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,269
and dirty this is a provision in most

464
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:47,169
major spending bills with one exception

465
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:48,970
since 24 2013 or 2014 that basically

466
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:50,438
says the Department of Justice can't use

467
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,939
funds to go after people who are in

468
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:54,490
compliance with state marijuana programs

469
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:55,980
so again making sure that you're in

470
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,509
compliance with your state programs not

471
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,039
transporting across state lines not

472
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:01,749
diverting to youth not diverting to

473
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:03,068
people who don't have a medical card or

474
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:04,480
to selling to people under or whatever

475
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:07,568
the age of your state is if you have a

476
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,429
rec program again you want to be your

477
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,928
the best friend of your state regulators

478
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,419
because you don't want to give the feds

479
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:15,669
a reason to come in and and tell you

480
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:17,350
you're gonna lose your license so or go

481
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,528
to jail for a violation of the

482
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:23,048
Controlled Substances Act so I talked

483
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:24,429
about how set sessions were sin to the

484
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:27,308
Cole memo and how we read Rohrabacher

485
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,720
and bloom an hour together so it's

486
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:30,819
unclear how the laws are gonna be

487
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,620
enforced but all to say everyone's

488
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:34,240
looking at December 7th which is when

489
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:36,369
Rohrabacher bloomin error expires again

490
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,990
one minute everyone is hoping that this

491
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,209
becomes permanent it hasn't become

492
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,548
permanent yet again Congress is very

493
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,250
nervous to move a big creaky rusty Shoop

494
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:47,970
ship away from the mentality of reefer

495
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,140
madness and Controlled Substances Act

496
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,159
I'm not gonna go through this is all the

497
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,659
federal legislation that's pending

498
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,890
though the only one that I really pay

499
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:55,990
attention to right now is

500
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,430
hemp legislation a lot of people tell me

501
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,470
hemp is completely legal

502
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,820
no problem simple you should probably

503
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,289
tell Congress that because they've been

504
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:04,779
spending a lot of time debating the fact

505
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,190
that hemp should be legalized so I'm not

506
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:08,470
suggesting that the restrictions are the

507
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,289
same as full-blown cannabis but they are

508
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,220
related I'm sure a botanist could come

509
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,659
up here and give you a much better

510
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,519
explanation than that but just know

511
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,940
they're related and Congress looks at it

512
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,740
that way

513
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,390
so again you can read my slides if you

514
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,529
have questions please let me know state

515
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,670
legislation that's where a lot of this

516
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:26,440
is happening I want to talk to that I'll

517
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,210
talk about the FDA I know Alice Meade is

518
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,650
going to do that all you need to know is

519
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,210
that the FDA has said you can't put this

520
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,890
in foods or dietary supplements so

521
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,450
before someone tells you that it's a

522
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,740
full-blown pathway to do that just know

523
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,840
that the FDA has said you can't do that

524
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,519
again a lot of this is not enforced

525
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:40,829
unless you're doing interstate commerce

526
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,299
so if you're doing within one state

527
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,949
generally okay but technically the FDA

528
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:49,329
says that's an adulterated food product

529
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,950
so just know that read these slides you

530
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,509
know again you're gonna hear a lot more

531
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,630
about the FDA approval process from

532
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:57,069
Alice Mead and I will be around I'm

533
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,930
going to the airport shortly so I'm not

534
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,669
going to stick around too long but my

535
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:06,900
contact information is on my last slide

536
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,900
and that's it so thank you very much
