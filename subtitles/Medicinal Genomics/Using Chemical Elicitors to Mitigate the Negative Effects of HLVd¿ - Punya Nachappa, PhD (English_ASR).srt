2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,359
using potential chemical elicitors yes

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,720
um to kind of I guess mitigate some of

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,118
the negative effects of hlvd so please

5
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:27,278
tell us more about that yes so um

6
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,198
chemical elicitors or synthetic

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,160
elicitors also called plant growth

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,960
Regulators as the name suggest it's a

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:39,039
chemical that mimics plant

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,280
hormones so it's essentially giving the

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,960
plants a little boost to get their

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,160
defenses going and this is not you know

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,719
I didn't come up with this idea uh um

14
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,959
we've been using it in Plant Pathology

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,679
and in entomology research as a way to

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,399
trigger plant defenses give them a

17
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,600
little boost to get it get it

18
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,679
activated uh you could also think of it

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,840
as a way to Prime the plants and and it

20
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,000
can protect against diseases and

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,840
pathogens because naturally plant

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,239
hormones or what we call phyto hormones

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,520
are doing this but they're doing it at a

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:19,560
at a low level so that you know the

25
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,840
plant can um devote all the resources to

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,079
the different functions we want to give

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,000
it this boost so it can get activated

28
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:29,399
and the reason that I was interested in

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,959
this research is because cannabis and

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,759
hemp can be considered organic U

31
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:39,759
production systems right because the um

32
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,680
the repertoire of um insecticides and

33
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,319
pesticides are so limited right all we

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,920
have and so there are only a handful of

35
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,158
products we don't even know their

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,560
efficacy and it turns out that these

37
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,840
chemical elicitors are actually

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,799
registered oh for use so that's that's

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,399
one of the reasons we went um we were

40
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,520
interested in this and so our idea was

41
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,879
to just boost the plant's innate

42
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:09,878
inherent immunity to better defend uh

43
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:13,239
the viroid and so prior to

44
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:16,840
infection um no we didn't do it prior so

45
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:19,719
we infected the plant and um a week

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,120
later so we got the plant um going with

47
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,000
the infection and then a week later we

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,360
sprayed these elicitors and then sprayed

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,159
every week for up to three weeks and

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,480
then subsequently I think at the fourth

51
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:37,639
or the fifth week we took uh tissue and

52
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:40,598
analyzed for hlvd levels using qpcr then

53
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:43,318
left the plants grow go to flowering and

54
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:48,000
then did the canabo analysis so you

55
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:51,560
could we we debated should we do it um

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,318
spray first then infect or infect and

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,680
then

58
00:02:52,318 --> 00:03:00,039
spray uh we decided to do and I uh

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,599
decided to do um the former because so

60
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:05,798
we we got clones from infected plants so

61
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:08,798
they were already infected um ready to

62
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,159
go cuz that's probably a more n we

63
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,400
figured that's probably more of the

64
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:16,199
natural situation the plants are already

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,640
infected excellent and so what were the

66
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,359
results oh my goodness so you you know

67
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,399
this already and this is how it goes

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,159
with research it's never yes perfect

69
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,879
result always more questions to be asked

70
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:32,120
offs right yes exactly but it's it's

71
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,798
great um we did two rounds of it and

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,840
we're actually getting ready to to do a

73
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,719
third round so the results were mixed

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,598
bag but very interesting what we found

75
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:46,199
was yes indeed certain phyto hormones or

76
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:49,518
chemical elicitors reduced hlvd levels

77
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:53,000
interestingly they also increased the

78
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,519
biomass um you know the yield of the the

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,878
plant which we were excited about but go

80
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,640
to look at the flow production and canab

81
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:06,959
oid levels and it was and are the major

82
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,639
ones like CBD and THC was actually

83
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,400
reduced I'll tell you biomass like

84
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:17,639
almost 50% for salicylic acid the

85
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:21,280
biomass increased 50% yeah compared

86
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,960
compared to infected yeah no they're all

87
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,719
infected compared to so the control was

88
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,279
ethanol because that's the solvent

89
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:33,960
salicylic acid dissolved in in ethanol

90
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:36,599
the biomass per plant was 88.3 gram and

91
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,038
in the salicylic acid sprayed it was

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,400
like

93
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:45,240
15% 15 grams oh wow yeah so almost

94
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,478
double almost double because these

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,560
elicit these phyto hormones also cause

96
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:53,079
the plants

97
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,800
to cause cell division in delay cense

98
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:58,800
and essentially giving it better overall

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,840
health excellent so I'm just picking

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,520
salicylic acid said uh they all look

101
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,959
pretty much the same some of the other

102
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:09,879
ones I'm saying

103
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:12,879
brassinolides was 12.8 gram compared to

104
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,600
eight so a little less than 50 so let's

105
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:20,680
look at

106
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:24,840
um umid we can again pick salicylic acid

107
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:31,240
TBD this is in micrograms okay so THC or

108
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:33,119
THC a was ,00 microG gram per gram in

109
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,280
the control in

110
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,038
ethanol and in sa it

111
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,399
was

112
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:47,360
1300 microgram per gram

113
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:51,239
30% so a third so if basically 100%

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,319
increase in biomass yeah but a 30%

115
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,038
decrease in th yes in thca interesting

116
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,120
interesting yeah but not so interesting

117
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:02,839
because guess what just after we did

118
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,800
this in this is a this was a twoe study

119
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:09,679
from 2022 just and he graduated uh in in

120
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,560
fall in Fall here comes a really nice

121
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,639
study and I can talk about that showing

122
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,399
that in fact higher levels our goal was

123
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,519
to cause induction our our the aim of

124
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,120
our study you know because we were kind

125
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:25,159
of going blind was we want to make sure

126
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,840
the plant the these um Pathways in the

127
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:32,439
plant salicylic acid or what what have

128
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:34,478
you was uh was turned on so we we went a

129
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,279
little high on the dosage and then a

130
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,959
paper came out saying higher dosage can

131
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:45,198
reduce can abono whereas a lower

132
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:48,120
dosage so since that paper came out we

133
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,478
are now we've got to fine tune the the

134
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:56,399
rates it's not so over applying it can

135
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:58,519
improve um reduce hlvd levels and um

136
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,799
biomass but does not have the same

137
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,719
impact for canab noids which is

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,038
important so you got to fine tune this

139
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,800
and so we're redoing um that experiment

140
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:13,759
it's already started and I should have

141
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,759
some new data uh for Canin excellent

142
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:27,639
