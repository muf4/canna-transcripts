ensure safe products

70
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,719
and why safety and contaminant testing

71
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,318
should be done throughout cultivation

72
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,080
and production of cannabis products

104
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,039
good morning grace thanks for joining us

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
good morning ben

106
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,560
it's a pleasure

107
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
great to have you um here on the podcast

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
and also

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
as our keynote presenter at canmed2021

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
in the safety focus area

111
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,000
and um i have to admit that the safety

112
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,680
focus area is always a little

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
challenging for us to select speakers

114
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
for

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,120
because as you know we like to attract

116
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,919
folks from many different facets of the

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
cannabis and hemp world the researchers

118
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,918
physicians

119
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,120
nurses cultivators lab managers

120
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,560
and typically the safety and lab testing

121
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,478
topics are a little

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,000
a little too technical for some people

123
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,758
who aren't in that field

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
but i think the topic that you have laid

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,040
out is really applicable to everyone

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,439
because it's all about implementing best

127
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,000
practices to ensure product safety which

128
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,120
we can all agree is is very important so

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,759
i was hoping you

130
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,720
we could start today with you providing

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,240
an overview of your presentation

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,360
um yes i'd be happy to so what

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,160
we did um it's it's great that you

134
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
mentioned that

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
um you know your your audience is

136
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,439
usually in the safety side

137
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,599
um in the in the health area

138
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,879
nurses and doctors and then we come the

139
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,680
lab managers

140
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,800
because i i took this risk assessment

141
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,478
approach actually

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,360
from the um from the emergency response

143
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,560
system

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,840
or or from codex

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,759
where they um where you assess

146
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,959
if there's something that's happening

147
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,160
for example a disease or an exposure

148
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,439
is it likely to cause illness

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,600
or harm and so i use that

150
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,879
into um into looking at contaminants for

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
food safety

152
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,159
so what we what we did was because a

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
long time ago

154
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,639
i had somebody come to me and and ask um

155
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,800
i have 2400 ingredients could you please

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
tell me what i need to test as far as

157
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,680
contaminants and what i need to consider

158
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,520
on this 2400 ingredients

159
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,360
and i looked at them and i'm like um

160
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,959
i really have no idea and that's

161
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,280
probably going to take a long long time

162
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,478
and a ton of money for you to test

163
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,879
so then i on my research i discovered on

164
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,519
this process of

165
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,759
of defining risk and and then we ended

166
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,719
up being able to come up with a

167
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,120
process where you look at your

168
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,240
ingredients the materials you work with

169
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,038
and then you determine

170
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,120
which materials are high risk medium

171
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,318
risk or low risk and then you categorize

172
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,759
your ingredients

173
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,439
and then if since most people only have

174
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,560
a limited amount of money

175
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,680
to put to testing even though

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,959
safety is number one and quality

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,680
is to protect the consumers um

178
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,120
it will it helps them it helps them to

179
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,000
um focus their dollars

180
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,120
on the riskiest ingredients and and and

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,478
cover more

182
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,720
and do more for uh ensuring safety for

183
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:20,318
the consumers

184
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,000
wow 2 400 ingredients what was the

185
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,520
what was the product if you don't mind

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,879
me asking

187
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:29,439
the product was actually candy wow

188
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,319
their products were candy a whole series

189
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,519
of candy

190
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,759
and um and a bunch of chocolate and

191
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,279
and gum and it's something that's near

192
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,639
and dear to a lot of us

193
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:44,878
and especially me i love chocolate

194
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,360
so um i had to do a really you know

195
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,560
it was important to get that and that's

196
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,960
very common

197
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,839
in the food industry actually um they

198
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,198
have

199
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:58,560
a lot of ingredients that go into

200
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,120
um one little product

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,160
to before it goes into the shelf there's

202
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,959
a lot

203
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,720
of processes that that happens and

204
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,598
there's a lot of safety checks that need

205
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,639
to happen

206
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,159
before it makes it to the consumer

207
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,759
yeah that's interesting because you look

208
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,520
at the back of the label and

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,960
you certainly don't see 2 400

210
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,878
ingredients listed there

211
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,318
so is it just that there's other

212
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,400
ingredients involved in

213
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,560
sort of the processes that go into the

214
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,839
final product that don't have to be

215
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,280
reported on that label oh no the 2400

216
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,239
ingredients is that that entire

217
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,879
company's um

218
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,000
ingredients they have different products

219
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,240
no no no we

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,240
we don't want 2400 ingredients in a

221
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,680
chocolate bar

222
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,759
i was going to say i thought it was a

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,519
fairly straightforward thing there

224
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,000
yeah that makes it that makes a lot more

225
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,959
sense forgive me for that

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,720
no that's all right so as you said your

227
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,639
camera presentation is a lot about risk

228
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,720
assessment when it comes to contaminants

229
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:59,199
and in cannabis and in hemp products

230
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,278
so when it comes to those those products

231
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
in cannabis and hemp products

232
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,958
which do you feel have kind of the

233
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:08,559
greatest risk in terms of

234
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:11,359
contaminants um what do you mean

235
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,679
the products or the contaminants itself

236
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,278
uh

237
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,958
let's start with the contaminants so i

238
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,120
know that there's you know microbial

239
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,639
contamination heavy metals pesticides

240
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,600
residual solvents

241
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,319
um where do how do you kind of rank them

242
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,399
are they all

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
i mean i guess they're all pretty bad

244
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,080
well they're all pretty bad and but and

245
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:31,519
they're important but they're important

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,839
in different stages of the of the life

247
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,919
of what we call from from seed to

248
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,040
shelf so as we all know

249
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:44,719
um in the hemp world that hemp

250
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:48,240
is a phyto remediator which means

251
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,278
it absorbs things from the whatever is

252
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,200
in the soil

253
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,039
so from the well first of all you have

254
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,480
to start with good quality seeds

255
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,838
and um and there's not much of concerns

256
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,080
for contaminants there

257
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,040
once you get into the ground you start

258
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,879
the exposure

259
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,199
to contaminants and that's where the

260
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,559
risk is how likely is it to be there

261
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,959
and how likely is that is there to be

262
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,759
going to be multiple contaminants

263
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,799
present in

264
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,679
in in the sample or in that material

265
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,319
that you have

266
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,000
so in the beginning pesticides and heavy

267
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,600
metals are really important

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,679
because as you plant it as soon as

269
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,399
you're growing it that's really what you

270
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,919
expose

271
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,039
your hemp for even though the farmers

272
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:36,240
don't unnecessarily apply to

273
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,360
the apply pesticides

274
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,799
as they're growing except in really

275
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
emergency needs and

276
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,958
when there's an infestation or something

277
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,959
like that

278
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,240
the crops that were there before

279
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,360
some pesticides could have been used for

280
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,680
it and then

281
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
there are there's also the pesticides

282
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,879
that have

283
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,039
lingered in the soil from ddt for

284
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,879
example from 20 years ago

285
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,799
it just doesn't want to go away so it's

286
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,879
still there even at low levels

287
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,000
and then the heavy metals which are just

288
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,720
part of

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
the soil you know lead cadmium and

290
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,560
arsenic and sometimes

291
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,600
sometimes and then as you grow them

292
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,119
you use water you know to irrigate and

293
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,040
and you have to think about the

294
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,480
irrigation system what kind of

295
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,759
contaminants you're introducing and

296
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,800
those usually are

297
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,319
also pesticides and some synthetic

298
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,759
compounds that you introduce

299
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,959
as you um as you grow that so in that

300
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,720
early stage

301
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,039
um it's your focus is pesticides and

302
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,079
then

303
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,519
heavy metals and then you harvest it and

304
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,399
as you harvest it

305
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,759
then you get into the then you introduce

306
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,200
some of the micro

307
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:52,319
because of storage and um when there

308
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,560
when there's moisture and um

309
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,600
so the pesticides still you inherit the

310
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,078
pesticide

311
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,159
and then as you store them there are

312
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:00,958
still some air there are still areas

313
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,000
that

314
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,879
use pesticides or insecticide for

315
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,958
cleaning

316
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,879
in the material area where you store

317
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,239
them so you could expose it to them

318
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,838
and then micro uh microorganisms

319
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,600
start growing and then you can start

320
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,279
having problems um

321
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,159
if the storing is not proper

322
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,399
and there's moisture and then you take

323
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,559
that from the

324
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,320
from the material that you have and then

325
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,039
you get into processing it

326
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
and let's go to the extraction part as

327
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,759
you extract it

328
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,320
that's when you start introducing the

329
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,600
risk for residual solvents because

330
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,800
that's what you use

331
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,720
um to extract them and all that and

332
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,359
and the process and then as you clean it

333
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,560
up um if there's a high possibility

334
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,519
that residual solvents could still

335
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,159
remain

336
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,679
and sometimes mistakes happen in in the

337
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,319
extraction process

338
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,799
and it's not the right solvent or

339
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,160
something

340
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,159
it's things like that those are of

341
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,319
course extreme situations

342
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,159
and then as you go take your extracts

343
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,760
and you go into the

344
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:13,120
production of other products where you

345
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:16,159
incorporate your

346
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,959
extracts or your oils

347
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,480
you introduce other ingredients and as

348
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,078
you buy ingredients

349
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,519
and some of it like for example you

350
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:28,719
combine your extracts with frankincense

351
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,560
or um some exotic scents and

352
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,879
essential oils um you introduce a lot of

353
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,799
then you could go back to increasing the

354
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,799
risk for contaminants again

355
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,240
and the reason for the higher risk of

356
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,879
contaminants is if you're

357
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,959
importing ingredients from outside of

358
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,958
the united states

359
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,239
or you're you're taking ingredients

360
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,319
outside of the

361
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,159
intended market um geographical market

362
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,199
of your product

363
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,439
the laws and regulations

364
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,240
are different in other parts of the

365
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,240
world

366
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,440
to to ourselves for example in

367
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,959
in the food industry in the eu um

368
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,800
carbaryl is not allowed is has

369
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:17,039
no longer has a tolerance for grapes

370
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,078
or it's very low i think it's the loq of

371
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,000
the method

372
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,399
in the united states scarborough is

373
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,399
allowed at 10 parts per million

374
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,240
so you could be making a product that

375
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,198
you're getting from grapes here in the

376
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,320
u.s

377
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,159
and be perfectly comfortable that you're

378
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,639
then you find carburetor you'll be

379
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,039
perfectly comfortable here in the u.s

380
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,959
um because you're well under what's

381
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,519
allowed the 10 parts per million send it

382
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,159
over to

383
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,278
you and your product will be out of

384
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,919
compliance

385
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,958
because carburetor is not allowed there

386
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,759
and that happens

387
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:52,078
a lot back and forth for example for

388
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,159
apple juice concentrate

389
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,399
the methyl weight or methylate is

390
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,919
allowed in

391
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,639
brazil if we import here

392
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,479
into the united states the method weight

393
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,519
the tolerance for dimethylate in

394
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,199
apples have been has been revoked so it

395
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,759
now becomes non-compliant

396
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,799
even though it was compliant from where

397
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,360
it came from

398
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,879
but it enters here we use it it is not

399
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,399
compliant

400
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:24,399
so the regulations um

401
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,799
enter into that a whole lot

402
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,600
and it has to be taken that's part of

403
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,559
the risk

404
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,399
and so that's basically at the end and

405
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,039
then

406
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,958
and then when you when you bottle your

407
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,078
uh

408
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,078
so that's basically how you look at the

409
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:45,679
distribution of the contaminants

410
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:49,120
for for hemp anyway and so

411
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,599
you have to determine what you're doing

412
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,759
with it

413
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,680
where it's coming from and what's going

414
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
and all the other things that

415
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,359
when you have final product that's a

416
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,680
derived product

417
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,959
um what went into the product and where

418
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,958
all those things came from

419
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,679
absolutely so it seems that you know the

420
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,319
best practice really is to be doing

421
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,799
uh ongoing testing throughout the entire

422
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,560
um

423
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,278
life of the plant the life of the

424
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,078
product i mean i know that

425
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,879
so much of i mean on the medicinal

426
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,479
genomic side we work with labs and

427
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,639
provide them with microbial testing

428
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,120
technologies and you know that's really

429
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,839
at the

430
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,600
at the end stage of all of this so it's

431
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,519
the final product that gets tested

432
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,480
before it can finally go to sale

433
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,879
and i think that a lot of manufacturers

434
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,560
or

435
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,519
cultivators sort of think that that's

436
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,000
where sort of this the testing begins

437
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,679
but it sounds like um there should have

438
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
been a lot of testing going on before

439
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,198
then

440
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,959
yes because if you if you think about it

441
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,159
if you're making a product you know in

442
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,159
in in

443
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,519
we used to have i don't a long time ago

444
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:04,879
uh we used to have this saying um

445
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,439
in the food industry a lot a lot of my

446
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,160
years were spent with the food industry

447
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,919
that if you're testing the final product

448
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,640
by the time it's in the can

449
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,199
it's too late to correct anything

450
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,280
because

451
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,558
if you test your final product and you

452
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,399
find contamination

453
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,480
you already have thousands if not

454
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,480
millions of cans sitting out there

455
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,798
what are you going to do with those now

456
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,400
but if you create a practice where

457
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,200
you're tracking it from

458
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,720
especially because hemp is such as

459
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,519
although it's been in existence for a

460
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,600
while

461
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:40,798
um a lot of this best practices is new

462
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:43,359
there's not a lot of background data so

463
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:46,798
you don't know

464
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:50,240
really the predictability

465
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:53,359
um of having contact is is still not as

466
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,919
well said as is it as it is in some you

467
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,399
know

468
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,440
food matrices that in the food world

469
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,440
that we've been doing

470
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,600
like apples oranges you know the risk

471
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,960
and all the stuff

472
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,439
generally no the contaminant risk yes

473
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,919
so that was the long answer the short

474
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,038
answer to your question is yes

475
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,080
it is a good it is really good practice

476
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,839
to keep an eye on your

477
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,839
product from seed to shelf

478
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,199
and correct me if i'm wrong but that's

479
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,079
that's a difference between

480
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,440
at least on the cannabis side and food

481
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,038
testing where

482
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,798
i know in the us that

483
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,359
we have third party labs that sort of

484
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,879
test the the final product to

485
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,038
give it the stamp of approval before it

486
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,120
goes on the shelf but again correct me

487
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,119
if i'm wrong that's not really how

488
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,119
food testing works right it's more sort

489
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,839
of on the manufacturer

490
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,000
or the producer to do their own testing

491
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,038
am i do i have that right

492
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,400
um not quite because

493
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,558
okay glad i added we'd have to close

494
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
we'd have to close down our labs if that

495
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,519
was true that we're good

496
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,720
our food that's right so um

497
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,918
there are testing that um is

498
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,839
in the um in the manufacturing plants

499
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,360
that are necessary for them to do

500
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,519
um in in place um like their quality

501
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,519
requirements and they're usually fast

502
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:24,558
um fast tests but um

503
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,918
food companies you actually use um

504
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,558
third-party labs

505
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,000
um a lot because it is very expensive to

506
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,359
maintain your own lab

507
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,759
and they have um it's not only

508
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,479
the food testing laboratories uh the

509
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,640
food

510
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,319
testing are you they usually utilize in

511
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,360
the food industry third parties

512
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:46,000
i um define it for uh

513
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,798
for two things the things that should be

514
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,558
in food

515
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,839
and the things that should not be in

516
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,399
food and

517
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,839
they can't which means like your

518
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,880
nutritional label

519
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:59,678
your your approximates your fat

520
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,120
calories your vitamins that's the what

521
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,360
should be in food and then

522
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,359
my world which is which are the things

523
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,199
that are should not be in food

524
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,279
and those are the pesticide contaminants

525
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,919
heavy metals any other contaminants that

526
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,960
you

527
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,960
could think about and testing

528
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,840
it's it's the go-to is usually a third

529
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,840
party lab

530
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,879
because it is very like i said in the

531
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,359
beginning it's

532
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,480
very expensive to maintain your own um

533
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,719
lab in-house

534
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,159
and it does require a lot of equipment

535
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,558
expensive equipment

536
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,240
and highly trained people to be able to

537
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:36,240
produce the kind of quality

538
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,558
that we use the term defensible in court

539
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,079
you know when when you have you you have

540
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,319
to consider

541
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,720
safety and compliance and in the

542
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,519
contaminant side

543
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,440
they use this often because not a whole

544
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,558
lot of food companies

545
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,679
nowadays it used to be more

546
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,839
have their own testing labs

547
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,919
they've gone to the third party route

548
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,279
and and and people because sometimes

549
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,600
people think

550
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,279
that it's not really required to test

551
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,119
for you know pesticides

552
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,119
you take a risk you don't have to

553
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,119
there's no law that asks you to test for

554
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,558
pesticides or heavy metals

555
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:17,678
but that's actually not 100 true because

556
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:20,879
the law in the food industry says that

557
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,480
you cannot introduce adulterated food

558
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:28,320
into the system but then pesticides

559
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:32,880
and heavy metals are um are defined

560
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,879
by law as adulterants

561
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,639
so indirectly yeah you have to because

562
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,599
you cannot have adulterants in your food

563
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,840
so you have to test for that and um

564
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,519
third-party labs

565
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,558
are the way to go for a lot of companies

566
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,839
it is a lot

567
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,720
less it is makes

568
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,959
a lot more sense economically to use a

569
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,839
third-party lab

570
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,079
i see so maybe that's where my

571
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,279
misunderstanding

572
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:04,558
lied are laid

573
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,720
was with um but there is no kind of

574
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,960
strict law that says you must send it to

575
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,038
this lab and have them sign off on it

576
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,159
but it's sort of just a more broad

577
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,599
general

578
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,080
law that says you know you can't

579
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,399
introduce anything that's contaminated

580
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,240
and then yes um the way that they they

581
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,280
meet that mandate is to send it to a lab

582
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,960
like yours

583
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,000
so that yeah so that's the difference

584
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,159
they they they don't um

585
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,400
they they suggest methods and all stuff

586
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,679
but they don't dictate you to go to a

587
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,159
certain lab

588
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
like they have they should have these

589
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,360
registrations like

590
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:42,000
ta registrations and all that good stuff

591
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,519
got it uh and so to continue in sort of

592
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,759
this vein of comparing

593
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,960
cannabis and hemp to more traditional

594
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,079
food testing

595
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,640
how is cannabis and hemp testing kind of

596
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,000
different

597
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,280
than food testing just in terms of like

598
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,279
the matrix itself is it a more difficult

599
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,119
uh matrix to work with when you're

600
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,720
looking for things like this

601
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,759
uh it it uh more difficult would be like

602
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,038
an understatement

603
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:11,359
it's really complex um the

604
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,640
the plant material is very complex it

605
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,798
has a lot of

606
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,480
you know you have all those can have um

607
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,918
i'm i'm gonna speak about

608
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,640
um for contaminants because that's i

609
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,038
know that very well um it took us a long

610
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,080
time

611
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,359
like for example when you in food just

612
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,798
take an apple

613
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,798
apple is mostly 90 water

614
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:33,839
some sugar in there a little bit of

615
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,279
minerals

616
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:39,439
and it's nice and clean when you

617
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,440
when you inject it into a for example

618
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,798
when you do that your extraction

619
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,720
um you inject it into the mat uh

620
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:51,440
into a gc you get a nice long baseline

621
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,200
and if there's some pesticides the peak

622
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,558
comes up

623
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,440
because that's the method it's very easy

624
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,759
to

625
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,400
hemp on the other hand is like um

626
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,119
there's so many things you have to it's

627
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,000
it's like

628
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,239
um a field of grass that's what it looks

629
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,759
like

630
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,278
or it's like a field of where you're

631
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,679
going through a field of grass

632
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,839
whereas when you're doing apple you're

633
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,679
like walking on

634
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:23,678
paper that's the difference interesting

635
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,278
so it's very uh the matrix itself is

636
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,480
very complex and there

637
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:30,159
are um compounds that are

638
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,599
that are present in there that could

639
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,840
mimic they're very

640
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,719
similar to sometimes the pesticides

641
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,480
themselves

642
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,839
so you have difficulty in separating

643
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,038
them and

644
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:43,199
um whereas in in many of the food that's

645
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,440
established already

646
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,600
you could easily do a screen for 300 to

647
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,320
500 pesticide compounds

648
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,158
that is not the case for him it's it's

649
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,359
quite challenging

650
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,679
and especially if you have to meet um

651
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,479
iso standards then it becomes really

652
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,960
expensive

653
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,200
when you have to validate for testing in

654
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
him

655
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,839
yeah and in talking with other

656
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
other folks in the lab testing space one

657
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,599
of the things that they always come back

658
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,919
with

659
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,278
as being one of the major challenges in

660
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,559
in doing what they're doing

661
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,319
has has to do with standardization um

662
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,158
and i think the kind of the first thing

663
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,759
is kind of is in line with what you were

664
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,880
talking about was just having

665
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,079
good standards to work off of um

666
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,320
in terms of all the different

667
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,558
cannabinoids and things so how does

668
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,439
that sort of lack of standard make

669
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,639
things even

670
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,038
more difficult for you um it

671
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,559
it challenges it's challenging for

672
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,079
everybody because that is the

673
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:47,519
the basis of your ability to quantify

674
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:50,720
um your results so if you're

675
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,000
if lab a uses a standard

676
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,240
they're assuming that they're all the

677
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,720
same but for example um

678
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,519
cannabinoid a i'm just gonna do it in

679
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,839
general terms

680
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:04,960
a cannabinoid a um and lab a standard

681
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:08,959
is 99 pure

682
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,000
in that for cannabinoid a whereas lab b

683
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,880
um is when you finally look at it

684
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,480
the cannabinoid that cannabinoid a for

685
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,000
the reference standard for lab

686
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,240
b is 95 pure

687
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,679
then you have a four percent difference

688
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,880
in in

689
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,798
results and it will be consistent the

690
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,840
difference will be consistent

691
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:36,240
so unless and hopefully

692
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,240
unlike other materials

693
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,919
nist as reference standards and you all

694
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,880
know that this is

695
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,759
when when you you know you can you can

696
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,159
calibrate

697
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,240
to that material because everybody

698
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,278
agrees that that material

699
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,200
has this kind of concentration we

700
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:58,798
don't have many of that around

701
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,960
for the cannabis and hemp world yet

702
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,119
in the testing um pesticides is

703
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,558
different but in the cannabinoids

704
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,079
because pesticides the reference

705
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:11,759
standards are very well established

706
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:14,079
let's see and to sort of

707
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,519
continue that line on standards i know

708
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,599
that you're involved with

709
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,558
a couple different groups who are sort

710
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,480
of trying to

711
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,960
establish some standards sort of in

712
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,159
different areas

713
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,880
and i i guess let's start with um with

714
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,559
the us hemp authority

715
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,000
what are you looking at from a lab

716
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,038
safety perspective

717
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,919
in terms of i know that well let me

718
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,879
backtrack

719
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,080
um the us hemp authority is working on

720
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,640
kind of certifying

721
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,199
companies who are distributing hemp

722
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,679
products

723
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,519
so and i know you're involved with that

724
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,120
so what are you looking at from a lab

725
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,158
safety perspective when you're

726
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,000
looking to certify companies well

727
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,480
actually what they're looking to certify

728
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,960
is the

729
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,079
the the good practices from from

730
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,558
beginning to end

731
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,240
in different areas of the from from the

732
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:05,359
growing to the production

733
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,440
and so um basically because there's

734
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,439
not only the actual reference standards

735
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,320
but there's a lack of standards

736
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,440
itself on on how what you do when you

737
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,879
have this plant

738
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,120
you know how do you harvest it how do

739
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,760
you test it and what testing should be

740
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,439
done

741
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,679
and that's the the the goal i think uh

742
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,278
for me the usm authority the

743
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,240
certification program

744
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,200
is to standardize this and um and to

745
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,399
give

746
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,120
um those that are involved in the hemp

747
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,239
industry

748
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:39,678
a a good solid ground to look at

749
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,640
as far as what is what how do you

750
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,798
um work with within the the industry

751
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,759
you test the product and so that you can

752
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:52,079
ensure

753
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:55,519
a um high quality and quote-unquote safe

754
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:58,639
product for consumers out there and um

755
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,879
just a little plot the guidance three

756
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,720
the usm authority has just come out

757
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,480
actually with the guidance three and

758
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,798
it's out for public comment and it'd be

759
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,079
great if everybody could look at that in

760
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:13,679
in the amp world and um

761
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:17,199
comment on the guidance that um

762
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,759
because it was revised um especially

763
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,200
with the

764
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,720
um ifr that just you know after the ifr

765
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,120
came out

766
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,120
yeah that's great and i'd be happy to

767
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:27,439
put a link in the show description too

768
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,639
so

769
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,679
people can easily find that

770
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,320
and submit their comments so

771
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,240
how does sort of the certification or

772
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,319
the standards that the us hemp authority

773
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,200
is creating how would that differ from

774
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,720
what we hope eventually the fda will

775
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,600
come up with in terms of

776
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,600
of safety standards it's actually very

777
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:53,278
aligned

778
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:56,798
to um there there's there's

779
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:59,679
um everything that we did we hope uh

780
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,240
we purposely made sure that it's aligned

781
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,600
with

782
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:09,839
um the usda and and

783
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,839
all the uh and a lot of auditing

784
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,039
groups there so that um everybody has

785
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,559
the same standard to work

786
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:21,200
from so they're they're aligned and

787
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,079
sometimes the requirement of the

788
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,840
certification

789
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:28,879
is a little more robust in some area

790
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:32,319
and in other areas the uh

791
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,880
the usda is more robust although

792
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,000
if you have the hemp certification you

793
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,120
will

794
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,079
be meeting the the goal the goal is that

795
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,199
you're meeting the

796
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:45,439
usda requirements

797
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,319
right so you're sort of that's sort of

798
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,159
you're meeting it

799
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:52,319
and more right yes yes right

800
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,760
excellent and one of the other groups

801
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,480
that you're that you're working with and

802
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,038
it sort of

803
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,480
ties into some of these uh usda

804
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,000
requirements that came out with with the

805
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,038
farm bill is i know that one of the

806
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,119
groups that you're working with

807
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,919
is the hia's sampling an analytical task

808
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,518
force

809
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,960
for sort of coming up with standards

810
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,720
around sampling

811
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,000
and i know that that's that's needed

812
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,399
because

813
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,200
and correct me if i'm wrong here but

814
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:18,558
when those

815
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,720
standards originally came out for the

816
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,278
farm bill um there was

817
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,519
quite a difference between um the

818
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:28,000
sampling standards that they set out

819
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,599
there as compared to sort sort of like

820
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
some of the international standards that

821
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,038
have been

822
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,798
in place elsewhere outside of the u.s

823
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,558
so um i didn't know if you wanted to

824
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,278
kind of briefly comment on

825
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,398
um how the what the disconnect is

826
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,278
between those two

827
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,079
sets of standards and um maybe give a

828
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,919
glimpse into

829
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:51,759
what you guys are working on well

830
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,200
it's it's um it's always the same

831
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,519
problem with sampling

832
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,278
because it's statistics and it's very

833
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,038
difficult for people to come to an

834
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,679
agreement

835
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,798
on what uh really is the best approach

836
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,240
to sampling

837
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,319
and there are many many things to

838
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,359
consider like even just the idea of

839
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,079
sampling

840
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,479
um what part of the plants do you sample

841
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,519
um

842
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,000
to define that and how much percent

843
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,720
comes from

844
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,519
the top from the middle the bottom and

845
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,159
so that

846
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,880
uh that is um up for discussion because

847
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,480
there are always

848
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,720
many um many

849
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,960
points of view and um in the end what uh

850
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,000
and and it's like you know many ways to

851
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,919
skin a cat

852
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,119
and most of them are statistically valid

853
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,360
depending on how you

854
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,199
you look at them and so that's the aim i

855
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:45,678
think that's the aim of the

856
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,880
of the hia's sampling task force

857
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,880
is to come up with a not only

858
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,440
a relevant and a solid

859
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,159
a fit for purpose sampling plan but it's

860
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,278
also

861
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,200
not um not burden

862
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,038
and it's not it's not going to be a

863
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,840
burden for the

864
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,720
um the growers or the people in the hemp

865
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,439
industry

866
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,720
so you want to get that balance of the

867
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,159
fit for purpose

868
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,640
and the practica and the practical

869
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,640
aspect of the sampling so you you want

870
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,600
to marry them together so that we all

871
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,559
are happy

872
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,079
we can all do it and you know it's it

873
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,278
because if you make this

874
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,278
the sampling part is part is very is key

875
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,038
um because if your sampling is messed up

876
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,440
then it doesn't matter what you do

877
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,240
afterwards the testing becomes

878
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,320
irrelevant

879
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,440
if the sampling is messed up the

880
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,240
interpretation is

881
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,120
is is gonna be different so it's

882
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,558
important that

883
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,839
um everybody um that the

884
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:51,359
sampling portion is not so difficult

885
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:54,000
that people get discouraged and don't

886
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,359
follow the proper way of sampling anyway

887
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,960
so you want to marry that

888
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:01,599
practical and fit for purpose

889
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,798
well yeah it sounds sounds challenging

890
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,918
for sure

891
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,679
and i know that when i had spoke with um

892
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,119
i believe it was brianna cassidy who is

893
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,639
another lab manager who's going to be

894
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,320
presenting at canmed

895
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,358
um she she said that the difference in

896
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,159
potency

897
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,719
in one cannabis plant you know from one

898
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,358
blood

899
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,319
one bud to another can be vast it could

900
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,759
be as much as

901
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,320
50 difference plus or minus

902
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,520
which sort of blew my mind a bit so i

903
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,519
imagine that

904
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,440
that's something you need to keep in

905
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:35,759
mind when you're thinking about sampling

906
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,320
to try to get a true representation of

907
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,599
what

908
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,480
this plant really is yes we're dealing

909
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,599
with

910
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,358
we're dealing with an organic material

911
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,480
you know so it's it's it's very

912
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:51,519
difficult it's not uniform

913
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,719
the weather the amount of sunlight

914
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:57,759
two days ago or thing or where you cut

915
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:01,199
it so so many factors

916
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,240
um affect the uniform distribution

917
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,078
it's you know if you because if you

918
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:08,000
if you think about it it's like the

919
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,240
distribution of the cannabinoids

920
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,440
if you had like a whole basket of

921
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,799
blueberries

922
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,960
and you sometimes apply pesticides on

923
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,000
the surface or it's it gets mold

924
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,920
on the surface um

925
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,440
if you don't mix it properly and if you

926
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,720
don't um

927
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,320
quarter it portion it you could end up

928
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:33,598
just getting the top and a whole

929
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,720
bin a whole a whole load of of your

930
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,119
contaminant

931
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,399
but if you mix it then you distribute it

932
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,400
evenly and you

933
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,079
you you have a better representation of

934
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,280
the entire sample itself

935
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,960
and that's and that's really one of the

936
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,400
key things to consider

937
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,280
um when you're creating or

938
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,320
writing a standard for sampling and and

939
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,160
the plant material

940
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:01,359
is the hemp is a very

941
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,920
um challenging it's it's yes it's a

942
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,239
challenge

943
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,838
and every and hopefully we can all come

944
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:07,759
to an agreement on

945
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,759
because if everybody's doing it the same

946
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,359
way then

947
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,480
you know the um you have

948
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:19,199
um confidence that you'll all be getting

949
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,199
the same results

950
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
great and and finally i that's

951
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,920
kind of working down your resume here um

952
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,559
your involvement with aoac

953
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,079
as well and the casp task force uh i

954
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,320
wonder if you could tell us a bit about

955
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,079
what you guys are working on there

956
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,160
um the the the aoac casp

957
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,280
program is actually working on a lot of

958
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,960
different things

959
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,480
they have um they have

960
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,639
a group that's involved with the

961
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,920
mycotoxins and they have the group with

962
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,039
the cannabinoids

963
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,519
and the group that i'm involved in

964
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,800
is in the training and education so

965
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,838
there's a lot going on

966
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,480
and i think casp has uh they were the

967
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:02,880
one that

968
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,838
established the method for testing for

969
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,640
uh for

970
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:07,440
the potent uh the cannabinoid um the

971
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:11,279
concentration

972
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,320
the cannabinoid the thc concentration

973
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,599
and they so they're they're the group is

974
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,480
aiming to

975
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,599
um standardize the analytical testing

976
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,880
portion

977
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,640
and there is also part for sampling but

978
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,400
and they're trying to put that together

979
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,519
so hopefully the hia the aoac the usda

980
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,358
and everybody

981
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,800
could be aligned in their approach to

982
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,319
sampling

983
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,480
right i mean i guess that's one of the

984
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,838
challenges of multiple groups trying to

985
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,440
set standards is that

986
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:43,199
there needs to be some standardization

987
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,200
amongst amongst them as well

988
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,079
so just in closing here grace i don't

989
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,719
know if there's any closing thoughts you

990
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,760
want to have

991
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,159
or if you want to give folks either

992
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,599
your social media if you're on it or any

993
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:59,118
ways to get in touch with you

994
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,480
for any additional questions

995
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,559
prior to the event this is your

996
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,838
opportunity now um

997
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:09,440
well uh just uh the one thing that i

998
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:11,119
kind of always like to tell people is um

999
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,280
uh don't forget your contaminants

1000
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,000
especially your chemical contaminants

1001
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,720
because they

1002
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,480
they they are important and you need to

1003
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,439
to be cognizant that they

1004
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,519
they are present and then you could

1005
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,559
potentially expose your

1006
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,039
consumers to contaminants and if

1007
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,599
if you're not paying attention to them

1008
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,639
and

1009
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,519
um to contact me i'm on linkedin and

1010
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:39,199
um i'm old school i'm kind of old school

1011
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,199
so my email is on linkedin

1012
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,920
and that's pretty much my social media

1013
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,440
presence

1014
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,960
that's nothing there's nothing wrong

1015
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,720
with that you're probably healthier for

1016
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,159
