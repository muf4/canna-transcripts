as you will hear in the interview Pam

44
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:05,819
and Cindy met at camed 2019 which is a

45
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,219
great example of how attending a can Med

46
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,719

Partnerships

48
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,759
we talked about the work Pam and Cindy

49
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,939
have done to understand how cannabis

50
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,459
affects human microbiomes specifically

51
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,919
the vaginal microbiome and what that

52
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,439
means for Women's Health Products other

53
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,799
topics we discuss include

54
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,020
why a healthy reproductive microbiome is

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,260
important for Women's Health the

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,420
anti-microbial activity of cannabinoids

57
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,479
the lack of safety testing around

58
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:42,000
Women's Health Products how cannabinoids

59
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,219
affect the gut microbiome and how

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,159
bacteria communicate with the human body

61
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,019
and affect Mental Health

62
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,239

[Music]

83
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:56,639
welcome and thank you for joining me on

84
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,039
the podcast

85
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,378
thank you thanks for having us

86
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,199
of course all right today we're talking

87
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:06,780
about microbiomes because if you didn't

88
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,479
know the typical human body is home to

89
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,818
approximately 40 trillion microbial

90
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,399
cells which is roughly the same amount

91
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,259
of human cells in the typical body in

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,418
many of these microorganisms are

93
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,639
essential to human health it must be

94
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:23,399
maintained with proper diet hygiene and

95
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,740
lifestyle habits so the question that

96
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,138
we're going to explore today is how does

97
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,780
cannabis affect our body's microbiomes

98
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,040
but first Cindy and Pam why don't you

99
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,198
tell the listeners a little about

100
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,000
yourselves and how you got interested in

101
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,160
researching how cannabis affects the

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,418
human microbiome and I'll and Cindy

103
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,259
we'll have you start

104
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:46,319
okay okay well you know I've been

105
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,780
involved in the Cannabis industry for

106
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,500
the past nine years

107
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:55,619
um I've built out two cannabis testing

108
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:59,819
facilities uh one in Las Vegas digipath

109
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:05,879
labs and one in San Diego clip labs and

110
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:07,918
during that time I became aware that

111
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:12,800
some of the contaminants that are

112
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:16,258
inherent in growing cannabis uh mainly

113
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,960
pesticides that a lot of them are

114
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:21,740
endocrine disruptors could potentially

115
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:25,978
be a problem for certain

116
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:29,400
segments of the Cannabis consumer

117
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:32,339
population and so that was already on my

118
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,560
mind about you know there's so little we

119
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:39,179
know about this plant and yet it's so

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,360
widely used and THC and CBD are you know

121
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,978
I consider them to be drugs and then I

122
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,080
meet Pam whose interest is more not on

123
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:52,500
the inherent contaminants in the

124
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:56,459
Cannabis but how those drugs the

125
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:00,600
cannabinoids impact the microorganisms

126
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:03,659
that are part of the human microbiome

127
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,660
and so that got me thinking in a totally

128
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,479
different way and uh Pam and I have

129
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,780
joined forces and I'll let Pam talk

130
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,879
about her company Apothecare and what

131
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:18,478
we're hoping to do

132
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,639
okay thank you Cindy so uh Ben this is

133
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,500
really exciting for me to be here

134
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,780
because I'm going to tell you that the

135
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,918
first time I was introduced to Cindy was

136
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:32,038
at can Med I agree so Cindy was on a

137
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,719
panel at can Med and I heard her talk

138
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,478
about it was then it was The Vaping

139
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,580
crisis and she was talking about the

140
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,120
work that she was doing at digipath and

141
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:43,978
how her lab was able to take a look at

142
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,840
some of these cartridges and analyze

143
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:49,439
what was in them because they also had

144
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,959
an r d arm and that's something that

145
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,360
started my thinking process because I

146
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,818
was looking for somebody to be able to

147
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,939
test the Cannabis products that I was

148
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:02,939
actually making in my kitchen for the

149
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:06,240
effect on the human microbiome

150
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:09,000
specifically the vaginal microbiome so

151
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,519
rewinding back a little bit further to

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,918
another can Med guests that you have had

153
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,500
Dr Brianna Cassidy

154
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,478
um yep so so Brianna was the first

155
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,560
person that I talked to about

156
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:25,560
um looking at how cannabis affects the

157
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,538
vaginal microbiome we are really

158
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,478
interested in how cannabis and

159
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:31,439
Apothecare can remediate pain pelvic

160
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,439
pain

161
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,719
and I started making these

162
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,939
suppositories in my kitchen and passing

163
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,520
them out to my neighbors my friends and

164
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,839
my family members but I wasn't sure if

165
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,698
they were actually

166
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,619
safe for use a little bit of a

167
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,840
researcher by Nature so I was wondering

168
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,720
well what is the effect that these are

169
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,060
having on the body I mean I knew the

170
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,860
folklore that they were effective but

171
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,500
were there any residual Downstream

172
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,879
effects and there wasn't anything in the

173
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,279
published medical literature or

174
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,098
scientific literature to say what

175
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,839
effects these had on the human body when

176
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:09,120
they were vaginally administered like

177
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,299
what were the circulating cannabinoids

178
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,098
or did they affect the microbiomes um so

179
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,319
at that point we started to look for

180
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:18,478
somebody who could help us in a lab to

181
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,639
determine if we found these microbials

182
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,978
could we take the Cannabis put that on

183
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,180
microbials and see what happened

184
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:29,639
and I listened to Cindy at can Med

185
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,500
um and at that point can Med was they

186
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,180
were focusing on The Vaping crisis and

187
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,360
Cindy was on a panel and she was talking

188
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,819
about how her lab was able to take a

189
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,379
look at the cartridges and what was in

190
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,719
um The Vape cartridges because they had

191
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:45,838
an r d component to her lab and I

192
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,420
thought hey that's really cool so I went

193
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,519
back to Massachusetts where I spoke with

194
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:52,979
Dr Brianna Cassidy who was at a

195
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,500
Massachusetts lab and we designed a

196
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,259
pilot study and then unfortunately Dr

197
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,659
Cassidy left the Cannabis industry and

198
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,700
went to Ginkgo bioworks but

199
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:05,879
she had written some papers with Dr

200
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,640
orser and together we approached her and

201
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,220
asked Cindy if she would take up the

202
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,559
mantle and proceed with the microbiome

203
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,600
testing and that's how we got to where

204
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,639
we are today

205
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,500
excellent I always love to hear about

206
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,419
can Med connections because we always

207
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,059
talk about how it's a great place to go

208
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,039
and you know learn from other people at

209
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:29,039
different sectors of the industry so I

210
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,659
always like to hear firsthand that we

211
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,240
were able to do that so that's fantastic

212
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:34,679
so so you did this pilot study tell me

213
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,240
more about it what were you testing and

214
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,819
what did you find

215
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,399
well I'm gonna let Cindy kind of lead in

216
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,519
the science Direction here basically

217
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,980
um you know I asked her to take a look

218
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,419
at how

219
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,659
products that were already on the market

220
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:53,639
and then some CBD and THC and how they

221
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,919
affected the four which Cindy's now

222
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:59,338
referring to as the Sentinel bacteria of

223
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,019
the vaginal microbiome and she did so

224
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,880
I'm gonna let her talk to you about what

225
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,399
she first found and then how we morphed

226
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,600
to something new after that

227
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:13,379
yeah so in the beginning because this

228
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,519
was kind of trailblazing work

229
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:22,759
um we just established a very simple

230
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:25,980
exposure study using the four prominent

231
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:29,639
lactobacilli species that are found in

232
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,240
the vaginal reproductive tract uh and

233
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:36,240
and looking and exposing them to various

234
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,278
intimate care products I call them

235
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,120
Legacy products they've been on the

236
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:46,200
market for decades as well as this whole

237
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:50,700
new swath of products that are coming

238
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:55,800
out seemingly on a monthly basis that

239
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:57,839
contain CBD or CBD plus THC and some of

240
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,179
the Lesser cannabinoids as well because

241
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,160
they're using some companies are using

242
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:04,879
broad spectrum

243
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:09,379
so you know we were just curious because

244
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:12,259
there had been many reports of

245
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:16,679
anti-microbial activity by cannabinoids

246
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:18,958
and we were just curious whether or not

247
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:22,319
the inclusion of the cannabinoids in

248
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:25,139
these products was impacting uh the

249
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,820
population of these healthy lactobacilli

250
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:32,059
species and what we found so far is that

251
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:36,260
in fact the cannabinoids are not

252
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:40,879
impacting uh the lactobacilli species

253
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:43,500
but there's obviously something in the

254
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:47,100
ingredients of some of these products

255
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:50,159
that are detrimental and completely Wipe

256
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,759
Out the lactobacilli and the consequence

257
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,759
of that is really shockingly detrimental

258
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,799
to Women's Health

259
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,200
it's difficult to re-establish these

260
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,439
bacteria if they're not there

261
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,640
maintaining this low ph and populating

262
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,180
the epithelial lining of the vagina that

263
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,519
allows other more

264
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:15,679
deleterious bacteria and viruses and

265
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,940
fungi

266
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:23,819
candida yeast to become established in

267
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:27,860
that epithelial tissue with dire

268
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:31,260
consequences from bacterial vaginosis

269
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,720
yeast infections and both of which turn

270
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,980
out to be fairly chronic and reoccurring

271
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,879
for women

272
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:42,600
but also it leads to inflammation of the

273
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:47,159
tissue and as you're probably aware that

274
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:50,399
in many cancer models in inflammation is

275
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:55,860
a first step to down that path

276
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,778
but surprisingly also disruption of this

277
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,120
normal

278
00:12:56,778 --> 00:13:04,860
biotic environment

279
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,620
leads to infertility uh poor outcomes in

280
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,360
pregnancy

281
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:14,039
endometriosis

282
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:17,519
so we believe that this isn't really a

283
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:20,159
big issue that should be brought to the

284
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,740
tension of the consumer of these types

285
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,379
of products

286
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,500
um but not at the expense of putting a

287
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:31,939
negative light on use of cannabinoids

288
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:36,539
for uh say pelvic pain

289
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:40,500
so we feel like we've exposed a big area

290
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:43,139
that is obviously under researched and

291
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,799
ignored as you know human or Women's

292
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:48,539
Health has fallen into that category for

293
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,559
some time

294
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:55,199
um so from our original simple screen of

295
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:58,138
exposing under anaerobic conditions

296
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,220
we've gone on to develop a molecular

297
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:05,278
assay we partnered with a company I

298
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,899
worked for before in Nebraska called

299
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,939
Matt mccor to develop our platform and

300
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,639
now we have that for lack of bacilli

301
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:18,480
species and we're moving on to having

302
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,839
developed for candida and we hope to add

303
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,820
other pathogenic bacteria and eventually

304
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,820
look at viruses as well

305
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,220
excellent and so just to just to Circle

306
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,078
back I if I heard you correctly did you

307
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,320
find that the cannabinoids themselves

308
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:39,719
were not disrupting the um you know the

309
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,000
good bacteria or is it and it's some

310
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,639
other component of these products and do

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,240
you know what that is yet

312
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,180
so that is correct to date and I

313
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,180
I make a caveat here that as you know

314
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,589
there are many many different formats

315
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:56,039
that

316
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,440
[Music]

317
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:02,039
um

318
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,500
cannabinoid extracts come in and we have

319
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:07,679
not

320
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:10,500
tested broadly we've looked at a couple

321
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:14,698
different isolates we've looked at CBD

322
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,159
and THC individually we haven't had the

323
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:19,319
bandwidth yet to drill down and look at

324
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:22,439
some of the other minor cannabinoids we

325
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,199
are looking at CBG right now we would

326
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:29,760
like to do that and as you also are

327
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:32,578
aware dosing is is an issue so we feel

328
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,000
like we have to go back and do some more

329
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:40,019
expanded dosing studies to make sure we

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,299
haven't missed something but to date our

331
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,839
conclusion would be that it is not the

332
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:47,939
cannabinoids that are the culprits

333
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,399
and when I started looking at some of

334
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,380
the other specific ingredients

335
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,019
and I just wanted to even mention even

336
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:57,360
another can Med connection uh right

337
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,940
because uh the hemp mine Dr Allison

338
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,519
Justice right so so

339
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,760
um we actually are are working with her

340
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:08,278
and sourcing some of our material

341
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,639
um from the hemp mine because it's also

342
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:13,019
important to us that we are looking at

343
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,879
the products that we know the source so

344
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,679
if there's anything that comes up in our

345
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,759
studies we can go directly to the grower

346
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,759
and say

347
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,519
you know so what do you think might be

348
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,620
here that we're missing

349
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,179
yeah absolutely and that and that makes

350
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,240
perfect sense if you're talking about

351
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:32,338
using you know broad spectrum products

352
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,360
um as we know there's

353
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,800
there's a number of different

354
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,199
cannabinoids and various different

355
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,120
concentrations and some very minor

356
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,799
cannabinoids and small concentrations

357
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,379
that we don't even really understand yet

358
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,299
so that is a bit of a a bit of a gordian

359
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,600
knot that you need to kind of unravel to

360
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:50,578
to figure out exactly is going on there

361
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,339
right right

362
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,319
excellent and so have you are you also

363
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:58,019
looking at

364
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,480
um like microbial testing regulations

365
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,698
around some of these um vaginally

366
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,759
administered products like I know for

367
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:08,338
example that there are a few states that

368
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,039
have specific testing requirements

369
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:15,838
around that uh Colorado being one as

370
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:18,000
well as Oklahoma and um Virginia so

371
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,519
in your opinion are those sufficient

372
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,220
would you um sort of recommend other

373
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,500
testing requirements around that

374
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,058
yeah Yes actually I would recommend

375
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,039
other testing requirements because I

376
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:32,039
think Cindy would agree with me that

377
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:36,058
those requirements are looking at what's

378
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:38,519
in the plant we're looking at how the

379
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:41,819
compounds the ingredients interact with

380
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:44,160
the actual microbiome so we like to say

381
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:47,519
that our testing is dynamic and that

382
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,480
testing is you know they're looking in a

383
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,859
different way it's something that's

384
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,000
already in the plant and we want to see

385
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:56,339
what the action is so I absolutely would

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,839
say that if you know we could do this

387
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:01,918
it's very small organization that we are

388
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,619
some of these some of these larger

389
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,679
organizations certainly could be testing

390
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:09,599
their products for safety on

391
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,400
um all kinds of microbiomes you know I I

392
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,259
spoke this morning with a with a woman

393
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,720
who's very concerned about the

394
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,599
urogenital microbiome and she suffered

395
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,360
not cannabis related but she's been

396
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,819
suffering from uh UTIs for over two

397
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,079
years that are basically one antibiotic

398
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,139
after another after another after

399
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:31,500
another and so when people say that

400
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,500
these products that um lubricants or

401
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,220
sexual serums is what we hear a lot

402
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,900
um are topical so they don't need to be

403
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,179
regulated because they're designed or

404
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,940
washes they're designed to come in

405
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:46,500
contact with the body but then wash off

406
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:50,038
there's not enough science to actually

407
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,140
show what the outcome is when you use

408
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,419
these products on a continued new basis

409
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,538
or what the duration is I mean we'd love

410
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,820
to have all kinds of funds to be able to

411
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,980
do these time studies in our lab but

412
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:03,779
what we're doing right now is what we

413
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,640
can accomplish what with the resources

414
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:08,178
that we have and we think we're just at

415
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,880
the beginning of looking at how

416
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:14,100
topically or internally applied products

417
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,080
affect the microbiomes of the

418
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:18,779
reproductive system

419
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,359
excellent so yeah so just to just to

420
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,460
clarify again so it's your your concern

421
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,139
isn't so much about you know microbial

422
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,419
contamination on these products

423
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,059
affecting the microbiome it's the Active

424
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,940
Components themselves in the the

425
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,139
Cannabis the cannabinoids that are you

426
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,779
know that still need to be better

427
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,820
understood well it's and it's not just

428
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:41,639
the cannabinoids it's the formulation

429
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:47,599
right because these products come in

430
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:49,160
various formats from uh lubricants uh

431
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:53,399
suppositories

432
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:56,940
uh pain relieving

433
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,340
um salves I I mean the the and and

434
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:03,360
there's really no requirement for

435
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:05,939
revealing what the ingredients are I

436
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,519
mean this is totally unregulated

437
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,298
unregulated

438
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:16,279
um most of these products are considered

439
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:17,839
Cosmetics so even even the ones without

440
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,819
cannabinoids

441
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,980
there's no regulation they're Cosmetics

442
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,720
you don't have to do any safety testing

443
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,419
to get them on this Shelf

444
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,919
yeah and I would say Ben that what I

445
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,299
think it needs to be both I mean

446
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,740
certainly we're concerned about

447
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:33,900
something that that is already

448
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,140
contaminated with a microbial you don't

449
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,480
want to add something and and honestly

450
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,340
that's part of where um you know in this

451
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,900
industry in the canvas industry there

452
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:45,000
are there are kind of two lanes right

453
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,600
there's a Pharma lane and then there's

454
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,519
there's the adult use Lane and I think

455
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:51,418
there's spaces for both but I think that

456
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,918
when we're talking about the

457
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,480
reproductive system we want to make sure

458
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,660
that everything's using good GMP

459
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,940
practices and that the products not only

460
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,038
are safe because they've been studied

461
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,200
for their impact on the body but they're

462
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,359
also safe because we know that they

463
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,519
don't contain something

464
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,279
um that's going to impact the body

465
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,619
right yeah and for me it sort of all

466
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,359
just comes back to this this kind of

467
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,279
idea that cannabis isn't just for

468
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,959
smoking anymore

469
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,119
um you know there's any number of

470
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,740
different ways that you can consume

471
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:26,099
cannabis or products that are being

472
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,259
infused with cannabinoids and you know

473
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,000
we don't fully understand how they're

474
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,579
going to affect these different systems

475
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,480
am I right

476
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:40,500
that's right I mean the endocannabinoid

477
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,500
system itself is so complex we don't

478
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,859
even fully understand

479
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:50,519
how it operates independently of the

480
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:53,639
addition of phytocannabinoids it's

481
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:56,400
certainly overlaps and cooperates with a

482
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,179
lot of other cell signaling systems so

483
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,880
it's different it's difficult to sort it

484
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,559
out at an individual tissue or organ

485
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,020
level

486
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,019
um but uh you know there are many

487
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:13,440
studies most of them on the gut

488
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:16,139
microbiome showing that if you have

489
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,640
changes or disruption leading to

490
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:23,580
dysbiosis whether through taking

491
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,559
antibiotics or probiotics that it leads

492
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:26,119
to

493
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,859
behavioral

494
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:31,979
dysregulation that affects emotions

495
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:35,279
anxiety and stress as as well as

496
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,659
pathology logical conditions so it's

497
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:43,579
it's a trifecta it's very complex and uh

498
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:48,320
it's very naive for us to believe that

499
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:50,819
we're we're not impacting uh how that

500
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,879
homeostasis is maintained in the body

501
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:57,019
when we're stripping out uh these

502
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,020
Sentinel bacteria

503
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:00,418
absolutely you know and I'm glad you

504
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,038
brought up the gut because

505
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,200
um I understand that the two of you are

506
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:06,960
also researching how cannabinoids affect

507
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,058
the the gut microbiome so I guess what

508
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,779
do we know so far and what is it that

509
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:15,779
you guys are are looking to investigate

510
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:18,658
well that's in the future we're we're

511
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:21,119
still uh you know working on the

512
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:23,940
reproductive tract microbiome

513
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:27,538
um you know for many reasons it's uh

514
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,640
it was how Apothecary was started it's

515
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:33,720
easier to work with

516
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:37,799
um but clearly the most uh Studies have

517
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:41,759
been published on the consequence of

518
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:45,839
disruption of the microbiota in the gut

519
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:48,859
and it's established the uh

520
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:54,240
the gut brain axis of the

521
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:56,759
endocannabinoid system uh and most most

522
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,798
of the convincing data comes from

523
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:03,658
pathological States so obesity uh

524
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,759
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease there

525
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,100
was a recent article that was very

526
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,879
informative on that

527
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:11,939
um

528
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,400
but it's really the studies have been

529
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:18,000
going on for a couple of decades I think

530
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,480
what's new is throwing in what is the

531
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,359
effect of the and in the animal model

532
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:29,579
they're usually animal models uh if if

533
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:33,479
they're consuming THC or CBD and and

534
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:36,899
certainly THC has an effect

535
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:41,220
um in studies that have been done in

536
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:45,740
rodents where they're fed THC with or

537
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:49,740
without a high fat diet that the

538
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:54,019
microbiota ratios change in terms of

539
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:57,558
speciation and also the mice lose weight

540
00:24:54,019 --> 00:25:01,918
which is you know extremely appealing

541
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:05,418
it's not completely clear what all is

542
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:10,380
happening at the receptor level

543
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:13,740
if you look at CBD be because CBD has

544
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:17,640
this reputation as alleviating anxiety

545
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,880
and inflammation those studies are not

546
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,520
as clear-cut

547
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,059
there are also differences in abundance

548
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,740
of certain

549
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:32,119
microorganisms when the animal is fed

550
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:35,700
CBD but it's harder to make that

551
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:37,759
connection with a behavioral change if

552
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,220
you're looking at anxiety

553
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:45,599
but those studies are ongoing there's

554
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,140
just extremely complex to carry out

555
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,119
um

556
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,679
and they're hard to do as you know I

557
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:51,658
mean research in this area one of the

558
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,640
reasons that Apothecare

559
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:57,299
um looked at commercial labs to do our

560
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,220
work is because using University or

561
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:00,240
um institutional like institutions like

562
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,460
that you know if they're federally

563
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,120
funded it's very difficult we all know

564
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,759
the hurdles that people have been facing

565
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,678
with doing research with cannabis for

566
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:14,038
quite some time and this seemed to us

567
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,620
like the most effective and expedious

568
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,538
way of doing the research is to go to a

569
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,658
commercial lab that already had the

570
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:24,419
capabilities to do r d and so that's why

571
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:27,360
we chose that path at Apothecare

572
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:29,340
excellent no and it's

573
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,839
I think it's important to remember so I

574
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:33,178
I mean we know that cannabinoids they

575
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,278
have this anti-microbial activity which

576
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,480
I think a lot of people myself included

577
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,400
think like oh that's a good thing

578
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,839
antimicrobial like you don't want that

579
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,700
but when you think about you know the

580
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,439
microbiome and how we need to have

581
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,120
beneficial microbes

582
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,919
um in our own bodies to help carry out

583
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,319
these processes

584
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,600
um might not necessarily be a great

585
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:54,000
thing so it's something to consider yeah

586
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,139
yes we definitely need a lot more

587
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,159
studies

588
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:02,220
um also because now we know that certain

589
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:06,299
species in the gut actually are making

590
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,700
their own signaling molecules that then

591
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:11,339
have a consequence on what's happening

592
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,340
in the brain I mean there was a recent

593
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:16,759
study at uh

594
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:19,439
peptide derivative of

595
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:22,440
isoamiline or something made by a gut

596
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,820
bacteria that they believe plays a role

597
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:29,640
in memory retention in the brain and

598
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:33,538
then in in in the case of the vaginal

599
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,538
microbiome I I keep telling Pam that at

600
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:37,079
some point we need to start looking at

601
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:40,200
um

602
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:43,798
hormone levels and how the cannabinoids

603
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,759
impact that because it it is in the

604
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:50,460
literature that the ECS system

605
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:53,658
interplays with estrogen which also has

606
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,659
a very complex

607
00:27:54,079 --> 00:28:01,439
regulatory role and not only in

608
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,839
reproduction but also in brain

609
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,919
development and it's not limited to just

610
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:10,918
females it's also males in particular

611
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,919
estradiol

612
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:18,659
um it plays a role in the expression of

613
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:22,080
Pha The f-a-a-h which is the key enzyme

614
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:25,860
that modulates the endocannabinoid tone

615
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:29,158
in the body so it's a primary actor in

616
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:33,178
driving endocannabinoid signaling and

617
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:37,760
again we don't really know how chronic

618
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:42,380
exposure to THC or c

619
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:46,140
affects this intricate play between

620
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,539
estrogen and the endocannabinoid system

621
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,980
and and that's true and these and these

622
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:52,319
are the things that we really started to

623
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,179
try to look at you know we we did prior

624
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,119
to working with Cindy um I had been in

625
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:59,640
contact with some researchers in Canada

626
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:01,739
to look at how if we introduce products

627
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,440
vaginally what again what the

628
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,880
circulating blood levels would be and we

629
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,519
couldn't get those studies approved

630
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,140
because you know they were it would one

631
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,819
would be one of the first studies and

632
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,500
they wanted to see more evidence that

633
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:15,839
the products weren't harmful to begin

634
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,058
with so that's why we kind of

635
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,619
started to do this like maybe micro

636
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:21,720
research we could say as we're looking

637
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:25,500
at the microbiome so because we can now

638
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,120
say that the THC isolate and CBD isolate

639
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,240
we're pretty confident that those do not

640
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,519
affect the healthy microbiota in this in

641
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,359
in the four bacteria that we are looking

642
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:38,158
at that that then gives us a lead to do

643
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,619
these deeper studies and to maybe get

644
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,600
funding from larger institutions like

645
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,699
the NIH that are very interested in this

646
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,819
as well because I do think and I think

647
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,940
many of us that have have been on the

648
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:54,298
adult use side of this believe that that

649
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,580
cannabis and cannabinoids can have a

650
00:29:54,298 --> 00:30:00,240
very positive effect on the human body

651
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:04,379
but we just want to make sure we explore

652
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,240
and are known knowing consumers of what

653
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,880
we're using

654
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,500
excellent excellent all right and so

655
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,600
winding down here because I see that our

656
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,859
timer is is counting down at the top I

657
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,579
don't know if you guys can see that as

658
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:17,158
well

659
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:19,319
um so before I let you go I want to give

660
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,000
you both a chance to

661
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,220
um tell the listeners about any

662
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,798
additional resources that they can look

663
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,880
at to to learn more about this topic I'd

664
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:29,879
be happy to put them in the show

665
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,960
description and then additionally uh if

666
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,220
there's a way that they can connect with

667
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,259
you you can make some more can Med

668
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,419
connections whether it's through social

669
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:39,798
media or websites or anything like that

670
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,799
so please uh plug away

671
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:46,319
Pam go ahead you're the social media so

672
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,419
so uh we you can go to apothecare.com

673
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,119
which is our website we do have a chart

674
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:53,220
up there of some of the some of the

675
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,939
things that we have tested recently and

676
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,100
those

677
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,019
uh contain both cannabis and

678
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:01,439
non-cannabis we we don't list any

679
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:04,139
products there because we are looking at

680
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,960
the type of products that we're using

681
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:10,740
right now and then eventually we will

682
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,240
start to list name products but right

683
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,640
now we're just looking at the the

684
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,620
content so be careful consumer beware is

685
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,299
what we're saying is be be aware of what

686
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,278
you're what you're using

687
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:22,918
um you know we are on Instagram at

688
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:25,440
Apothecare and also Twitter

689
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,538
um and again this work is nascent we are

690
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,159
in the beginning phases so what we'd

691
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:31,319
like to do is just raise awareness we

692
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,480
want people to kind of demand that their

693
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,798
products are tested for those that

694
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,778
contain cannabis and those that aren't

695
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,418
if they're using them for intimate care

696
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:41,519
so that's what I would say is my my big

697
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:44,220
shout out is just to raise awareness you

698
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,099
know start asking questions

699
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,679
yeah I couldn't agree more I there's a

700
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:52,139
big consumer advocacy component to this

701
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,919
we would love to get the fda's attention

702
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:58,559
and require testing of these products

703
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,360
before they end up on the Shelf to show

704
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,440
whether or not they're stripping out

705
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:06,740
these Sentinel lactobacilli species I'd

706
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:12,500
also like to plug that

707
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:16,200
