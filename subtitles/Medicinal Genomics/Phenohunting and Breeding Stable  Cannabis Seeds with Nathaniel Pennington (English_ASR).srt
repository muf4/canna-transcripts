Pennington

32
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,500
Nat is the founder and CEO of Humboldt

33
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,039
seed company and has been supplying high

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,159
quality cannabis seed to Growers since

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,920
2001. in 2018 they hosted the world's

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,680
largest phenotype hunt teaming with

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,140
local farmers industry experts and top

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,100
researchers many of whom are camet

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,439
alumni

40
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,839
we talked about that Mega phenotype

41
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,879
project as well as Nat's process for

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,820
breeding cannabis seeds that are

43
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,699
consistent and reproducible

44
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,519
topics include the phenotype rating

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,799
sheet used to evaluate plants the

46
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,939
process of creating stable purebred

47
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,459
lines

48
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,500
why Humboldt Seed Company chooses to

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,900
sell purebred lines

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,098
the benefits of growing from seed rather

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,099
than clone

52
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:22,679
the benefits of Autoflower varieties in

53
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:25,019
common misconceptions and the importance

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,480
of Legacy Growers collaborating with

55
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,400
academics and researchers

56
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,098
before we get to my conversation with

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,620

the first to develop a complete nutrient

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,659
system that unlocks the true genetic

62
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,818
potential of the cannabis plant

63
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,639
since its Inception the brand has

64
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,919

[Music]

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
good afternoon Nat thanks for joining us

74
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:26,878
on the podcast

75
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,459
oh it's a pleasure to be here man

76
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,158
I'm honored all right let's talk about

77
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,900
Fino hunting I know it's a big part of

78
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,120
what you do out there at Humboldt Seed

79
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,560
Company to find unique genetics that

80
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,019
eventually make it into your new seed

81
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,780
lines and in fact I watched the Fino

82
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,060
town I watched the phenotype Mega hunt

83
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,799
video on your website that was a project

84
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,840
that you did with a bunch of folks many

85
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,760
of whom are can Med alumni which was

86
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,259
great to see and I'll put a link to that

87
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,939
video in the show description so people

88
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,318
can check it out but for those who

89
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,719
haven't heard of it or haven't seen the

90
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,539
video maybe you can describe what you

91
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,580
guys did and how it's different than a

92
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:05,579
typical funeral hunt that you do

93
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,260
sure so I'll give you a little bit of

94
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:13,620
like set and setting for the uh impetus

95
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:15,379
for that that giant project so go back

96
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,819
in time to

97
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:20,040
2016-17 and

98
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:23,279
you know we had had years of of medical

99
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,360
cannabis in California of course being

100
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:30,439
that we we passed that you know 1996 the

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,240
the first medical cannabis uh program

102
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:35,160
Statewide and that was amazing

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,280
um but you know we didn't have scale

104
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,400
like we have like you know what's needed

105
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,679
to uh Supply a recreational Marketplace

106
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,698
so

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,639
um

108
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,960
but there were a lot of things about

109
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,000
that

110
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,299
fact that we had finally passed a

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,120
recreational cannabis bill

112
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,560
or uh it was actually an issue a voter

113
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,840
initiative but

114
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,540
it was kind of a little scary because

115
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,819
you know Colorado and Oregon had had

116
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,900
come after us with medical but then had

117
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,699
actually

118
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,239
gone ahead of us with the recreational

119
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,819
and so we were kind of seeing the

120
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,418
potential to just have kind of

121
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:21,719
monoculture and large-scale agricultural

122
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:25,379
practices that you know I feel like we

123
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,500
should learn from the mistakes of

124
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:32,459
big monoculture and you know like so

125
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,100
that said we knew what was coming uh

126
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,899
2018 we were gonna start our

127
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,520
recreational program in the state of

128
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,758
California

129
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:45,000
um being in Humble which has like you

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,660
know some of the most deep roots in

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,519
cannabis probably of any place or or as

132
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,620
deeply rooted as any place in the world

133
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,060
I would say

134
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,418
um

135
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,519
you know one thing that we saw as the

136
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:02,099
seed company or one of the bigger seed

137
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,779
companies was like let's make the best

138
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,740
of this and

139
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:10,679
take the opportunity of scale whatever

140
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,780
opportunities are there let's definitely

141
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,360
take advantage of them and and we felt

142
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:18,899
like one of the biggest opportunities

143
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,000
that the scaling presented was the

144
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:25,138
ability to look at

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
uh cast a huge wide net for phenotype

146
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,400
analysis and

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,740
we had already I have a background in

148
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:36,538
doing genomics with salmon restoration

149
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:39,240
that is a you know a big uh

150
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:41,879
effort in the North Coast in Humboldt

151
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,918
County in particular we have rivers that

152
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,139
have been you know decimated for the

153
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,519
once abundant salmon run so I was really

154
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,280
involved with that

155
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,918
working with uh agricultural school like

156
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:57,119
UC Davis and their conservation genomics

157
00:06:52,918 --> 00:07:00,299
department I kind of

158
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,120
would ask around to the professors and

159
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,240
fellow you know people working grad

160
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,860
students and whatnot in labs and just

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,139
ask what would be the first thing that

162
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,840
you would do if you were in a position

163
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,478
like us having a license and having a

164
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,560
nursery and having an established Seed

165
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,079
Company

166
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,939
there hasn't been a lot of there's been

167
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,240
a wonderful amount of work done on

168
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:27,240
cannabis breeding but it hasn't been

169
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,759
able to be shared publicly because this

170
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,259
we've been under prohibition for 100

171
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,960
years so

172
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,639
what would you do and and we kept

173
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,519
hearing over and over again well I just

174
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,840
look through 10 000 plants I'd plant ten

175
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,060
thousand

176
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,560
you know of as much diversity as you can

177
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,978
possibly get

178
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,160
plant it all in big giant fields and and

179
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:54,300
just go and Hunt through for what really

180
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,160
speaks to the needs of the community and

181
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,960
uh

182
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,900
so I kind of started wrapping my mind

183
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,019
around what it would take to do that and

184
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,459
and realized that it was actually

185
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:10,680
possible as long as we did it really

186
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:11,879
collaboratively and so in 2016 and 17 we

187
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,819
just kind of were establishing

188
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,139
Partnerships with Farms that were likely

189
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,840
to have

190
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,360
a big scale out and have a lot of

191
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,219
acreage come the first year of

192
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,479
recreational in California

193
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:30,060
and so partnering up with I think five

194
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:32,879
farms at the end of the day not

195
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,839
including our two facilities

196
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:40,219
so all in all around seven locations we

197
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:43,380
actually got up to the 10 000 plant Mark

198
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:46,920
that we wanted to be able to look at

199
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:49,799
over the course of a summer and it was

200
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,899
all genetics that you know following

201
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,778
suggestions that were

202
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,059
it intended to be fairly diverse so like

203
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:01,200
you know first generation poly hybrid

204
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:03,719
type stuff and uh then

205
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,660
the the really fun part of it was you

206
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,839
know who decides what's the

207
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,458
the greatest of all or not even just the

208
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,160
greatest but who even decides what are

209
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:17,759
the in the top uh

210
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,079
one or five percent of the best and

211
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,000
that's a good point and that's a good

212
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,259
point too so when you were doing this

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,740
did you have sort of a a prototype type

214
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,899
plant that you wanted to discover or was

215
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,278
it hey let's just plant this all and see

216
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,059
what comes out

217
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:38,278
well so that's a great question and and

218
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:41,399
kind of where we were going we did have

219
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:44,399
a phenotype rating system that we had

220
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,080
developed several years before and we've

221
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,179
published that on our website we've

222
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,200
published it in a few other

223
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:55,439
uh you know kind of open cannabis

224
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,700
um research internet sites but um and so

225
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,380
we tried to share it around and it's

226
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,300
still available on our website under the

227
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:04,019
learn section and then

228
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,278
the the ideal phenotype to me was was

229
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,620
what

230
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,838
this broad diverse of people that were

231
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,959
in involved in the industry even all the

232
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,300
way down to a bud tender at a dispensary

233
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,899
who sees a lot of people coming through

234
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:21,838
and what they're asking for and so

235
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,480
as you mentioned a lot of like alumni

236
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,940
for can Med and and a lot of probably

237
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,560
people that have been speakers at your

238
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:34,560
guys's events uh ended up being the the

239
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,778
invitees uh and whether they did the

240
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,479
Fino hunt with us and then went on to do

241
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:41,100
can Med or vice versa

242
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,259
um yeah I'm sure there was a lot of

243
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,839
overlap but basically we we wanted to

244
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,519
have other breeders

245
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,480
um geneticists

246
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,959
we wanted to have dispensary owners we

247
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,539
had lab technicians or or even people

248
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,819
developing laboratory equipment

249
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:03,299
uh

250
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,339
we did have blood tenders and we had um

251
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,019
other Farmers too so we had a lot of

252
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,700
other farmers of course because we were

253
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,360
working with all these Farms so they all

254
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,700
wanted to go along on the tour and

255
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,839
the of course the rating system that we

256
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,278
developed kind of helps to guide what

257
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,800
might

258
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:26,278
get selected into the top percentages

259
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:30,000
and so in doing that basically like our

260
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:32,539
our pheno type rating system is

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,458
built out in a way that that it's

262
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:38,039
numeric and so you can put it into

263
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:41,278
something like an access database and

264
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:44,219
then query out features or traits that

265
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,838
you're looking for in in a plan even

266
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,240
down to

267
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,459
something like color we you know right

268
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,220
now it just so happens that

269
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:57,179
purple cannabis has become trendy again

270
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,940
and it's kind of always of course being

271
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:02,458
a cannabis breeder uh

272
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,940
you know we we kind of pay attention to

273
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:09,239
the trends but we don't let them dictate

274
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,399
our decisions so much but but we

275
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,399
we might plan on making more purple

276
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,659
cannabis uh seeds this year because we

277
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,320
know that that's something that's

278
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:22,379
popular but yeah and how

279
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,180
how easy is it to sort of adapt to

280
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,338
different Trends because I imagine it's

281
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:29,519
got to take you know a good amount of

282
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:32,459
time to do the final hunt to find the

283
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,159
you know the good genetics and then to

284
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,479
sort of have a stable set of seeds too

285
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,879
that's going to give you a consistent

286
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,940
phenotype right so how how quickly can

287
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,720
you sort of you know address the changes

288
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:48,600
in the market luckily if you do massive

289
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,920
Fino hunts every year

290
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,620
and hold on to as many of these diverse

291
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,379
types that speak to people in you know

292
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,179
to a diverse group of people including

293
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,740
yourself and

294
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,899
um you know you can't just let your own

295
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,240
opinions totally rule your decision

296
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,100
making then you've got it you know and

297
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,680
that's been the wonderful thing about us

298
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,860
it's also kind of our

299
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,759
cross to bear let's just say but we've

300
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,480
got

301
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:22,559
so many years of built up

302
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,259
genetics in whether it's in storage in

303
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,679
the form of germ plasm that's like you

304
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:31,439
know kept in our climate controlled seed

305
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:34,138
cooler area or whether it's actually

306
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,860
still kept as a clone from a phenotype

307
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:41,039
punt or in tissue culture or so on and

308
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,919
so forth you we've got it so when a

309
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:46,740
trend happens

310
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,740
you know you you're dealing with what

311
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,459
you know and your own

312
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,700
um

313
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:56,458
essentially your own breeding line which

314
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,639
which makes a huge difference because

315
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:02,399
if you just pick up a clone that's

316
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,919
happens to fit the bill it's it's purple

317
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,559
and it produces a lot and it tests

318
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,500
pretty well the problem is is this if

319
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:14,578
it's not a

320
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,679
at all like a pure red line then as soon

321
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:19,620
as you try to do any breeding with it

322
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:23,219
it's just gonna produce this vast array

323
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:26,039
of phenotypic variation and so you know

324
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,459
you're much much better off like having

325
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:32,278
even just germplasm that's been stored

326
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:34,379
or seeds for those that

327
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:38,519
um and seeds that have been stored for

328
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:40,259
even five or ten years because it hasn't

329
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,778
been popular recently but all of a

330
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:45,958
sudden you know blueberry smelling

331
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:48,198
cannabis becomes widely popular and

332
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:52,679
um so you can just kind of pull that out

333
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:56,219
and and there it is and it's any

334
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:59,539
serious breeder should be

335
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:03,180
thinking about creating stable

336
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:06,059
lines for that's like your toolbox as a

337
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:10,019
real breeder you if you're just

338
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:12,000
going with random clones that you get

339
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,860
out of I mean that's a great way to

340
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,059
start a breeding program but that's like

341
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:20,159
literally Step One is having like a good

342
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,599
clone that you find from a phenotype

343
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,419
hunt and that's what I think a lot of

344
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,519
people don't understand is like

345
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:29,639
you know we started doing these big

346
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,120
phenotype hunts many years ago and

347
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,860
keeping clones but then

348
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,679
it's really the beginning of the process

349
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,720
because before

350
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,039
you know you you should release anything

351
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,560
to the public

352
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,480
or before you can

353
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,399
the biggest thing I try to get through

354
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,899
people's mind is like you to have

355
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,698
something

356
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:53,278
that's a real

357
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:55,620
breedable line it should produce

358
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,120
repeatable results so like you could you

359
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,320
should be able to take

360
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,078
one seed and grow a plant out of it and

361
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,060
cross it with whatever if you're making

362
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,500
a hybrid seed or if you're making an

363
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:10,739
inbred line

364
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,539
and and have it produce a batch of seeds

365
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,480
that

366
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:17,578
that are both uniform and and then you

367
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,139
could go back and take another seed from

368
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:23,399
the same population

369
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:26,759
perform that same experiment and have

370
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,860
fairly similar or the same result and

371
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,600
it's kind of just like the basis of all

372
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,419
sciences that

373
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:37,079
essentially if you look at making a

374
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:38,458
cross of a cannabis cross as as an

375
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,439
experiment

376
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:42,958
it's not really

377
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,959
you're not finding out any result unless

378
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,958
you can do that again and have a similar

379
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,958
result and so you know like

380
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:54,958
if we cross this

381
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:58,319
you know Nepalese type cannabis that got

382
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:00,958
these wonderful features with this older

383
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,199
variety that's been grown in you know

384
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,318
Jamaica for the last 100 years then you

385
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,740
get this amazing

386
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:12,899
Turpin and cannabinoid combination those

387
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,120
kinds of discoveries can only happen

388
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,640
when you have

389
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,139
um relatively pure lines that you're

390
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,319
working with

391
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,720
and how hard is it how hard is it to get

392
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:27,298
to that Pure Line I mean because you've

393
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,160
obviously in most cases have to start

394
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:31,379
with that

395
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,480
um you know very heterozygous type plant

396
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,720
right so how difficult is it to sort of

397
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,460
get it to a place where it's pure and

398
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,220
it's going to be creating you know

399
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,538
repeatable seeds and that when you when

400
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,480
you're Crossing it it's going to give

401
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:48,000
you a sort of repeatable result

402
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,599
so that's a really really great question

403
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,160
and it has a lot to do with

404
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,199
how

405
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,460
um

406
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,980
heterozygous or homozygous the plant

407
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:02,940
might be when you start and so

408
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,640
if you did let's just say happened to

409
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,160
find a seed

410
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,799
you know an accession or a group of

411
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,860
seeds that came from an isolated area

412
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:17,460
people are calling like land race seeds

413
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:19,859
that have for the most part just been

414
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,058
bread within that population and

415
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,558
selected

416
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,740
uh

417
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,240
for let's say you know 10 years or

418
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,160
something like that then that just kind

419
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,740
of like a naturally

420
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,140
going to be naturally fairly homozygous

421
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,460
population and so you're kind of jumping

422
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,460
ahead but

423
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,980
but then again the the negative of that

424
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,579
is that you know when we've done that

425
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:48,839
and gone like you know into the deep

426
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:50,699
into the interior of Jamaica and found

427
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,720
um you know the Jamaican Lamb's bread

428
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,058
for example that

429
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,259
propensity for

430
00:18:56,058 --> 00:19:00,798
hermaphroditic traits was incredibly

431
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:05,279
high and there was like a lot of

432
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:07,798
non-commercial type stuff and so

433
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,899
really more often than not you're

434
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:12,960
probably working with with more modern

435
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:18,298
cannabis types and

436
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:21,298
the answer to that is anywhere from

437
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:24,000
I would say four to

438
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:26,038
eight generations and and it depends on

439
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,359
how you're doing it whether you're

440
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:32,400
selfing a plant which is basically

441
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,199
uh you know taking a clone of the

442
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,080
genetically identical plant and

443
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,819
reversing the sex of it

444
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,220
um you know which is essentially just

445
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:45,418
how we make feminized seeds in general

446
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:48,000
and so you you take away the uh

447
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,400
the hormone ethylene or its its effect

448
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,220
that the plant naturally produces you

449
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,298
block it and then it goes to to make

450
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,419
male

451
00:19:54,298 --> 00:20:00,298
organs rather than female organs but the

452
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:03,419
the chromosomes in the pollen granules

453
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:06,480
are a female by doing that you can make

454
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:08,700
a self-pollinated cannabis plant which

455
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,519
really would not normally happen in

456
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,919
nature because cannabis is a for the

457
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,200
most part a dioecious plant meaning that

458
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,320
it has a male

459
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,538
uh separate male flower on a separate

460
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,500
plant and a female flower on a separate

461
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:26,879
plant

462
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:30,419
as opposed to most plants are monicious

463
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,520
where they can pollinate themselves

464
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:34,380
um that's not to say that all plants are

465
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,058
pollinating themselves all the time

466
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,419
there is a lot of

467
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:42,058
uh you know bees obviously are doing

468
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:44,100
their share of the work and cannabis is

469
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:47,579
wind pollinated so I like to compare

470
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:50,519
corn where you have the tassels are the

471
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:52,859
male parts of the Corn plant and then

472
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,839
the silk is the female part

473
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,579
and and probably there's a lot of

474
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,099
self-pollination of course because the

475
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,960
tassels are right above but in a corn

476
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:02,639
field there's probably also you know

477
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,259
there's wind and things like that that

478
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,038
blow that pollen

479
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:10,079
uh certainly over to adjacent plants so

480
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:13,558
but back to cannabis

481
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,538
we can self-pollinate cannabis now with

482
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:16,798
um you know through the methods that

483
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:19,079
we've

484
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,298
un you know figured out with with the

485
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:24,359
cell you know sex reversal and things

486
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:26,160
like that and that's a really fast way

487
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:30,178
to get to

488
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:34,679
full homozygosity or

489
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:37,679
um you know more much more uniform and

490
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,480
purebred lines I've kind of started

491
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,080
calling them purebred lines more and

492
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,538
more because people just kind of cringe

493
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:48,178
at the inbred line but inbred line is

494
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:50,460
really the term and in plant breeding

495
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:53,700
it's not it's not really a bad thing

496
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:57,240
especially when you know that the goal

497
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:01,380
is to have a highly inbred line

498
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,839
and then find something that is really

499
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,840
I would like to say like heterotic or

500
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,819
just really mix as well that's also an

501
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:12,658
inbred line and that is what a true

502
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:16,038
hybrid seed is and right and that's when

503
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:19,320
you have uniformity and

504
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:22,619
heterosis or otherwise known as hybrid

505
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,298
vigor and um that's kind of like the

506
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:28,558
Holy Grail of

507
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:29,579
of all seeds for agriculture purposes

508
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,339
um

509
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:33,899
you know that's the corn that we all you

510
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,178
know like the sweet corn that we are

511
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,340
harvesting out right now

512
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,500
just for our little kitchen Garden is

513
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:43,259
they're a hundred percent gonna be

514
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,599
hybrid seeds and so that's something

515
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,599
that we we're all striving I think many

516
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,799
um cannabis seed companies that are more

517
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:56,099
uh have a little bit more of a

518
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:59,038
scientific slant to them are are working

519
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:00,480
on that because it'll certainly be

520
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,940
make

521
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,740
not only growing cannabis easier but

522
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,720
it'll make a

523
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,519
you know more repeatable experiments

524
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,058
which is kind of what we were

525
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:14,819
talking about before where so

526
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:17,759
so going back to this Mega Fino hunt

527
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:21,359
that you did so at the conclusion of it

528
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:24,058
you've identified how many different you

529
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,279
know sort of standouts and then what's

530
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:28,918
the next step after that

531
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,200
right so

532
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,259
we identified

533
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,319
what we really only kept

534
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:39,779
one percent and it and with even the

535
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:41,639
goal was to keep less than one percent

536
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:44,519
because

537
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,640
even one percent of ten thousand is is a

538
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:50,579
heck of a lot of plants to have to you

539
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,500
know turn into mother plants or preserve

540
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:54,720
with tissue culture

541
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,538
and and so

542
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,819
with the one percent that we did keep we

543
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:03,000
put a lot of those into different

544
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:06,779
growing environments like indoor grows

545
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,400
uh mixed light growing and and sort of

546
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,619
just

547
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,679
you know shared them back with our

548
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:15,178
community and you know we we immediately

549
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,840
did

550
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:21,720
release a few things as clones and then

551
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:24,779
very quickly started

552
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,480
um breeding those for Steep like a seed

553
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:30,538
line stability and

554
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,240
um what I know that some plant breeders

555
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:34,740
would shake their head at me but you

556
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,038
know we're not

557
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:41,519
what we still do release some of our

558
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:43,619
purebred lines to the public because

559
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,940
it's just the best product that we have

560
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,038
right now

561
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,919
in the Cannabis space for people to be

562
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,798
able to grow with seed and still have

563
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,480
product like still have

564
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,000
I mean one of the biggest things that we

565
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,220
think because we sell seeds at retail

566
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,880
too for like hobbyists and and people

567
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,380
that want to grow their own medicine and

568
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,960
um they're just a lot more accessible

569
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,159
and they're actually a lot more vigorous

570
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,400
and

571
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,480
in a lot of respects there I think you

572
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,419
know

573
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,980
it's a cleaner way of growing cannabis

574
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,559
because you don't have pests and

575
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,819
pathogens that can come with clones

576
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,220
we're all seeing the hot plate and

577
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:25,740
viroid thing you know it's sweeping

578
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,839
across the industry and devastating and

579
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,240
and hop late and viroid doesn't really

580
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,798
even transmit through seed

581
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,620
very much

582
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:37,200
um if at all so

583
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:39,778
so basically it's a much better way it's

584
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,038
just that we haven't done the real

585
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:46,259
breeding work to make the seeds produce

586
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:50,158
the way that and if we're going to say

587
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:52,679
something has you know this amount of

588
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,500
CBD and this amount of THC or it should

589
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,600
have a smell that's you know blueberry

590
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,298
muffin is one of our more famous ones

591
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,459
that people like or it finishes you know

592
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,740
the flowering time is this that or the

593
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,940
other we want it to really be that way

594
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,519
and that's

595
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,259
something that you can't have unless you

596
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:14,339
make

597
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:17,038
um seeds populations uniform and

598
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:20,819
so whether that means kind of sharing

599
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:23,278
what I think most seed breeders would

600
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:24,899
consider their sort of intellectual

601
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,359
property

602
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,519
um we've kind of

603
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:33,119
said to ourselves well look this is what

604
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:34,798
the the Cannabis Community needs and we

605
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,839
know that we're giving away some of our

606
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,658
IP but

607
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:41,459
you know good luck trying to do what we

608
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,640
do because it's it's actually like

609
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,700
really hard and so for now we're like

610
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,460
you want to follow in our footsteps like

611
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,860
go for it and

612
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,000
um good luck and especially considering

613
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:56,639
that like

614
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,140
as the developer of many of these

615
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,580
genetics

616
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,940
you know

617
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:05,879
not only is it a real challenge for us

618
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,640
to maintain so many and

619
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,740
constantly be you know generation after

620
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,140
generation and selection and all that

621
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,339
but how would how would someone else

622
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,919
know

623
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:20,879
what to select for

624
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:23,880
and what phenotypic Expressions that to

625
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,179
kind of like cue in on

626
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,100
just jumping in you know say we're

627
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,200
releasing something that's

628
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:34,740
you know eight Generations in of

629
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,798
selection and breeding you know try to

630
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:41,240
jump in and and know

631
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:43,379
be as familiar with that plant as

632
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,519
as like

633
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,740
are extended team that we've got is is

634
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,259
familiar with it and it's it's just

635
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,659
would be impossible to

636
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:55,859
to know what you're even looking at and

637
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:58,380
that's I think

638
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:02,459
it's kind of a beautiful thing about

639
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:05,400
cannabis that it rewards people that

640
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:09,900
that love it and have

641
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:12,019
had a lot of interaction with it and

642
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,980
you know you see people like Allison

643
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:16,619
Justice that

644
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,538
maybe haven't been

645
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:22,079
quite as

646
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:24,240
have had quite like the longevity of

647
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,558
Humboldt seed company but

648
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,259
but

649
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,658
are definitely not afraid to get their

650
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:33,960
hands dirty and are jumping right into

651
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,039
you know being out there in the field

652
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,720
and

653
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:42,900
law observing how the plants grow and uh

654
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,700
doing a lot of you know tons of testing

655
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,820
whether that's

656
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,919
a hundred percent in the lab or you know

657
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:52,619
a little bit of consumption mixed with

658
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,840
the lab you know it's it

659
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:57,839
you can do both you know and and I think

660
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:00,240
both are valuable but I think that it is

661
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,199
kind of important to

662
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,819
um

663
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:09,360
just be out there year after year and I

664
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:12,058
I mean I'm sure that she would

665
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,079
you know if we were to give her a call

666
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:16,980
right now

667
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:20,639
and and say you know have you uh do you

668
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:23,399
learn something new and and Incredibly

669
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,220
eye-opening every single year you know

670
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:28,739
since like the Fino hunt

671
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,480
uh where where she came out and and so

672
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,640
many people came out and got a chance to

673
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,599
just see fields and Fields of cannabis

674
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,000
like

675
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,500
you know that they had never even

676
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,538
imagined

677
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:46,140
and then going and doing that themselves

678
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:47,700
now for for years with with hemp and in

679
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,200
different climates and in different

680
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,159
regions

681
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,200
um

682
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,200
I guarantee you Allison would be like

683
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,380
every single year I learn I mean the

684
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,759
plan just it blows my mind so it's it's

685
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,000
something that

686
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,579
you you can't just jump in you know with

687
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,460
and think that

688
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:10,678
even if you have

689
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,960
you know I mean my one of my good

690
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,820
friends k

691
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,980
is a PhD

692
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:20,759
plant breeder she graduated from UC

693
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:24,480
Davis she's worked in cannabis now for

694
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:25,859
two or three years and

695
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,460
you know

696
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:31,859
she teach she has a lot to teach me but

697
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,440
I would venture to say that she has

698
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:36,418
probably you know called me up for

699
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,278
advice about

700
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,980
you know how the cannabis plant is going

701
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:42,119
to react to this

702
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,019
um

703
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:48,298
you know breeding strategy versus the

704
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:51,179
other breeding strategy more more than

705
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:53,778
than vice versa and so

706
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:56,278
I think we're seeing this great mix of

707
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:57,179
Academia and

708
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:59,359
um

709
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,980
and Hands-On

710
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,019
experiential knowledge and it's it's

711
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,899
gonna do the plant

712
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:09,720
I I think it's going to do us

713
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:12,719
some favors and and start to accelerate

714
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,419
things a lot and

715
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,399
um

716
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:19,559
minded though you know people have to

717
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:20,898
people from the old industry space have

718
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:24,178
to be

719
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:26,398
open-minded to you know

720
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:28,919
it's a traditional breeding practices

721
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,019
and even you know marker assisted

722
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,299
breeding and

723
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:35,579
you know it's going to take a lot I

724
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:39,119
think for people to be open to Gene

725
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:41,038
editing and GMO and I'm not I'm not

726
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:44,099
endorsing that I don't think we need

727
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:46,019
that right now at all and so there's

728
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:48,298
I mean there's so much work that can be

729
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:50,460
done with

730
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:53,700
um the tactics that we've used for the

731
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,919
last hundred years at in humanity that

732
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,360
we can apply to cannabis before we would

733
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,380
ever

734
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:04,439
need to jump into that space But

735
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,059
you know no matter what it's probably

736
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,038
probably helpful that the plant's so

737
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:10,319
diverse too right so it's not so much

738
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:12,839
that we need to necessarily edit in

739
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,759
tricks from other plants that

740
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,538
um to apply to cannabis where you know

741
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:20,099
we could hopefully just find it in the

742
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:20,940
diverse genetics that are already out

743
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:23,519
there

744
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,038
yeah exactly I mean you know one of the

745
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:30,240
greatest one of the things that's that

746
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:33,778
really gave me another boost of

747
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,880
excitement about what I do was starting

748
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:38,538
to work with the uh

749
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:42,480
what we call auto flowering or

750
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:43,619
rooteralis is sort of the and uh

751
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,019
you know

752
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:49,319
I started about eight years ago just

753
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:51,778
toying with it and um

754
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:54,058
you know getting some seeds from over in

755
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:55,079
Europe where it actually kind of had

756
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:57,418
been

757
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:59,220
a little bit more common and popular

758
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,020
than in the United States and just

759
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,759
saying to myself like I see what this is

760
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:07,440
all about because

761
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:10,919
you know I've heard mixed stories and

762
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,679
and so firsthand you know that's

763
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,440
cannabis is something that like

764
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,259
you know you really gotta just like I

765
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:23,340
said get your get your fingers dirty and

766
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:26,640
get in there to really know so got these

767
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:28,798
root around seeds was it took a few

768
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,679
years to figure out some of the

769
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,179
nuances like how they're very sensitive

770
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,000
to

771
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:38,700
um the early tour first two or three

772
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,339
weeks of their life they need to be uh

773
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,840
put into a you know I think the best way

774
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:44,699
in the long run the best way to grow

775
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,740
Autoflower is going to be to direct seed

776
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:51,179
them in in fields or or into

777
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,460
pots or whatever wherever your growing

778
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:55,679
media is just to get them directly put

779
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,019
in there and I think the seeds need to

780
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,538
be a little bit cheaper before people

781
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:04,019
are going to do that so that's kind of

782
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:06,720
on people like me to help make it more

783
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:07,380
reasonable but

784
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,099
um

785
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:14,099
you know they they need to be if they

786
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:15,599
get root bound at all even the slightest

787
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:18,300
bit of

788
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,820
uh root bounds

789
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,460
constriction then they'll go right into

790
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,519
flower but other than that there is so

791
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:29,519
many advantages of of that

792
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:31,378
type of cannabis and what I learned

793
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,179
quickly was that

794
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:37,139
you know this is kind of back to like

795
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:39,480
the editing GN not GMO but just like

796
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,919
something like crispr

797
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,500
um

798
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:46,799
but you don't need that tool but what I

799
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,980
realized was that you can through three

800
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,039
or four four or five generations

801
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:57,300
you can for all intensive purposes

802
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:59,820
cut the trait of auto flowering so you

803
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,280
know no matter what I'm not gonna pay

804
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:05,460
attention to the day length and flower

805
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,960
in the fall I'm gonna flower after

806
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,019
you know I'm going to be finished let's

807
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,199
just say finished flowering after two

808
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:16,739
and a half to three months that's a

809
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,819
ruderalis cannabis and you can cut that

810
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:22,979
trait

811
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:26,400
and paste it into any of the popular

812
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:28,619
photo period types or or rare

813
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,280
cannabinoid types

814
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:32,220
um

815
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,920
CBG CBD

816
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:36,719
I haven't done it personally with thcv

817
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,780
but but

818
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:43,199
my point is is that it doesn't have

819
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,040
baggage and a lot of people assume that

820
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:46,679
like

821
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:49,259
oh it's Autoflower it's gonna

822
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:52,919
be you know low THC or it's going to

823
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:55,140
have a loose flower that doesn't look

824
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,720
good enough to be you know sold

825
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:58,500
commercially or

826
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:00,358
um

827
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,300
you're restricted to a certain set of

828
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:06,119
cannabinoids and and I just have found

829
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,280
none of that to be the case and and so

830
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,820
that's been kind of a

831
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:14,160
you know as you said like cannabis is

832
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,700
diverse and look at this like lo and

833
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:20,578
behold someone who had been breeding for

834
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:23,578
15 years prior

835
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:28,320
uh in a cannabis Mecca

836
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:29,700
could find this new trait that just you

837
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,220
know one of the big things for me is

838
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:35,039
like so many people are utilizing the

839
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:36,779
light deprivation techniques to make

840
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,960
their cannabis flower

841
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,420
more quickly in an outdoor setting and I

842
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,820
was always just

843
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,200
kind of

844
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,640
distraught about the amount of plastic

845
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:49,139
that was being

846
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:51,539
you know

847
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:53,400
put on this Earth yeah through through

848
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:56,159
that and I mean we're guilty of it

849
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,079
ourselves we utilize light depth I'm not

850
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:01,199
saying that we're above that or anything

851
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,980
but it I just knew that hey here's a way

852
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:08,819
that we can have nature

853
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:13,500
um do this for us and

854
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:15,539
it also allows people in areas that you

855
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,239
know like up in Canada we had a lot of

856
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:20,279
demand for our Auto flower genetics

857
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,019
there because

858
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,560
um you know they have such a grow short

859
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:27,000
growing season that uh you know that was

860
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:29,039
just wonderful for them to have

861
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,699
something that you know it's great to be

862
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,619
able to plant something and then know

863
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:36,539
this is what I'm going to be harvesting

864
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,880
at and

865
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:40,858
whereas with photo photo period cannabis

866
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,320
sure we know when we're going to be

867
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:46,380
harvesting it but it's always going to

868
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:50,160
be in October it's not like it right

869
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:51,599
choice you can't

870
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,420
so

871
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,619
you know farmers can plan

872
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:01,920
and we're not having to sacrifice the

873
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:04,619
traits that you know we have come to

874
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,260
know and love in in the photo period

875
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:10,320
type of cannabis and and it was just

876
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:13,440
like a whole nother set of work that was

877
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,460
you know of course as a plant breeder

878
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,820
you're

879
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,960
a a big job is actually kind of

880
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,619
sometimes

881
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,539
what what you need you know it gets you

882
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:26,700
re-inspired and and so that for us was

883
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:27,960
was inspiring but but of course we

884
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:32,039
haven't

885
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:35,099
changed our program of just whether it's

886
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:37,500
photo period or Autoflower

887
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:41,519
um generally just exploring this

888
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:45,079
incredibly diverse species and

889
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:48,659
you know the UN Untold

890
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:51,119
vast uses that are that we're

891
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:53,399
discovering all the time it's and and

892
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:58,280
you guys I know

893
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:01,800
are really a big contributor to the

894
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:05,760
understanding and exploration of the

895
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:09,000
plant and I really appreciate every you

896
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,640
know every paper that you put out or

897
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,780
all of the uh

898
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,078
you know

899
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:19,079
conferences and and networking events

900
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,539
and it's just a great way to connect all

901
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,099
the people that are so interested in

902
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:25,920
this and

903
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,920
and uh yeah

904
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,420
yeah it's a it's a diverse it's a

905
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,579
diverse problem and it's going to take

906
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,380
all of us in our different areas of

907
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,240
expertise to kind of

908
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,559
push us forward and that's one of the

909
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,000
you know one of the reasons we love

910
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,759
doing canned meds because we get to

911
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
bring together the The Growers the

912
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,339
researchers the doctors the

913
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,358
um the industry people and everybody to

914
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:50,519
kind of

915
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:51,900
try to figure out you know how we how we

916
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:53,579
move this thing forward and one of the

917
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,320
things you mentioned earlier was you

918
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:57,660
know one of the the things that we

919
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,000
highlighted at the last can can Med with

920
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:02,358
a group from Humboldt actually

921
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,280
um sort of talking about

922
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,199
marrying the experience of the folks who

923
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,740
have had the hands-on experience with

924
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,838
the plants with the academics who are uh

925
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:14,338
you know researching the plants now and

926
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:16,920
sort of

927
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:18,358
you know finding the scientific reasons

928
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,720
for what you guys may have already

929
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:24,480
discovered and sort of you know bringing

930
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:26,519
that information to everybody so um I

931
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,500
think that's a really really important

932
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:31,619
part I'm assuming you're talking about

933
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,199
like Daniel Hendricks and then doc yeah

934
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:37,200
yeah yeah those guys are some of my best

935
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:37,858
friends yeah yep

936
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,779
um

937
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:43,139
and that's exactly right you know that

938
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,000
those their Pioneers here in Humboldt

939
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:47,578
and

940
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,639
um Doc is just another breeder that has

941
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:51,359
been around even well before my time

942
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:53,039
um

943
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,420
and somebody that I have a lot of

944
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,338
respect for

945
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:01,260
and you're absolutely right you know

946
00:40:56,338 --> 00:41:05,880
it's uh bringing the the Academia and

947
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:09,900
you know this world that has existed for

948
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,240
so long you can't discredit it because

949
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,039
you know whether or not

950
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,719
um

951
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:20,039
you know

952
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:22,799
we we were Outlaws at a time and whether

953
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,480
we're still Outlaws in the eyes of of

954
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,320
some you know

955
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,900
um

956
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,859
it it is

957
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,420
and and has been a plant that's been

958
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:38,098
appreciated

959
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:40,619
uh by humanity and and a useful plant

960
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:43,619
for since the beginning you know time

961
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:45,539
immemorial let's just say and um

962
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:49,039
you know

963
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:54,900
I there's no denying that that it's

964
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:57,599
thankfully finally coming into uh

965
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:00,420
you know out of the the sort of darkness

966
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,440
and clandestine world that it was in and

967
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,460
and

968
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,159
so heck yeah let's merge together all

969
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,699
these skills and

970
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:14,699
um capabilities and and I think you know

971
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:15,838
circling back to the the phenotype Mega

972
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,659
hunt

973
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:22,320
um you know Hendricks team they were big

974
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:23,399
involved with that whole project and

975
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,640
um

976
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,539
you know that that maybe was like one of

977
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,799
the

978
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:32,400
you know

979
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,280
earlier attempts at that kind of a

980
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,539
gathering and a meeting of the minds and

981
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,300
uh

982
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:42,960
you know gosh I can't deny that just

983
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:46,320
being close to universities like UC

984
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,380
Davis and even what's now called Cal

985
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,539
Poly Humboldt used to be Humboldt State

986
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,420
but it's a Polytechnic

987
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:56,099
uh University now part of Cal poly's

988
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,460
program

989
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:02,760
um it has a lot of potential for us but

990
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:06,358
and we've been able to utilize that

991
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,900
those resources there a little bit

992
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:08,880
um

993
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,039
gosh I don't know if I should even admit

994
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,579
but sometimes more you know and a little

995
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,679
bit of sneaky way

996
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:17,640
and universities can touch hemp and they

997
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,460
can

998
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:22,259
um right you know do some sequencing

999
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,019
work we've done some sequencing work

1000
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:28,260
whether it was uh technically hemp or

1001
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:30,119
not let's maybe save that for

1002
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,520
when when we're all laughing about

1003
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:35,579
laughing about how silly the laws were

1004
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:38,280
in 30 years but uh

1005
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:40,980
you know doing stuff with the

1006
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,619
universities is just you know in the

1007
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,440
normal Ag and plant breeding world

1008
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:48,000
that's so commonplace and it's so

1009
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,700
critical to

1010
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,159
being able to you know

1011
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:57,719
both

1012
00:43:53,159 --> 00:44:00,480
um kind of foster a Young Generation of

1013
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:02,159
people that are educated

1014
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,099
in

1015
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:08,338
in plant breeding or a skill or trade or

1016
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:09,240
what whatever and and doing it in in a

1017
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:12,659
real

1018
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:16,019
setting that is like the essentially a

1019
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:19,858
business that has you know an economic

1020
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:21,960
future and a value and we can't do that

1021
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:25,318
right now we can't do it well let's just

1022
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,300
say at least and so a lot still needs to

1023
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:29,460
happen

1024
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,680
um but we're

1025
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,838
we're appreciate we're glad that we're

1026
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,759
close to UC Davis I'll just tell you

1027
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,659
that and we're already developing as

1028
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,599
many

1029
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:41,279
uh connections and and

1030
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,099
you know Gathering as much information

1031
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,019
as we can and you know Humboldt seed

1032
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:48,599
company is

1033
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,980
I I think it shocks a lot of people that

1034
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,440
were

1035
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,780
you know self-capitalized and we don't

1036
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,139
have a massive

1037
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:02,160
research budget but when we do have

1038
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:06,779
budgets that and we we do put spend a

1039
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:08,699
lot of money on doing r d and research

1040
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,660
and

1041
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:13,439
um

1042
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:14,460
we've seen kind of some of the pitfalls

1043
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,119
of

1044
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:20,699
taking on massive investment and having

1045
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,800
you know kind of

1046
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:25,559
you know having the folks that

1047
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,800
essentially lent you money breathing

1048
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:30,358
down your neck and saying you know well

1049
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,839
look I don't care about what you're

1050
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:36,900
doing to make the plant better for five

1051
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:39,480
years from now like we need to get out

1052
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,818
of the red today and you need to start

1053
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:46,019
right we want our money now we want our

1054
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:48,000
money now and so that I mean I I think

1055
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:50,460
you know our lucky stars that we've been

1056
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,079
able to navigate without having to do

1057
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,139
that because

1058
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,480
you know every day we wake up at

1059
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:58,559
Humboldt seed company and say what can

1060
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,858
we do

1061
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:05,039
to you know make this plant more

1062
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:06,659
accessible and better and more

1063
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:07,980
consistent

1064
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:09,239
and

1065
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,400
you know

1066
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:15,000
discover

1067
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:18,480
unique diverse useful

1068
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,659
types and so that's just a great

1069
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,179
uh mission to to have when we wake up in

1070
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:26,159
the morning and it's all been very

1071
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:30,659
organic it's all been

1072
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:32,940
you know through connections like

1073
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:35,818
you know just introductions from someone

1074
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,338
like Allison Justice having

1075
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:41,219
come and participated in one of our Fino

1076
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:44,279
hunts and I think earlier like you asked

1077
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:46,799
how we're keeping up with that and

1078
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,200
you know as you can imagine

1079
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,000
we did the 10 000 plant hunt we did

1080
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,500
another

1081
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,079
substantial hunt the next year and then

1082
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,219
we really started to have

1083
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,099
um

1084
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:00,899
the effects of covid

1085
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:03,420
were

1086
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:06,960
definitely made for some of the smaller

1087
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:09,659
hunts that we ever had so I think in in

1088
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,260
2020 uh

1089
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:16,739
in 2021 we we didn't have quite as vast

1090
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,680
of a population to look through just

1091
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:20,639
because we really weren't

1092
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,940
um

1093
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:26,900
you know going from Farm to farm

1094
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:32,460
potentially spreading covid and

1095
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:34,440
looking at it but um we still I think

1096
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,838
every year we've maintained at least

1097
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,519
like looking through three thousand

1098
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:40,920
and and this year we're looking through

1099
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:44,338
5 000 plants

1100
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:47,220
actually more because we've got our

1101
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:49,739
facilities over in New York

1102
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:53,338
but um

1103
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:55,379
yeah it's

1104
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:56,880
it's definitely

1105
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,400
you know

1106
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,160
it's our right now it's it's the biggest

1107
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,400
thing tomorrow I'll be looking at going

1108
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:08,578
to a farm called Casa floor which is an

1109
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:11,460
outdoor farm in Mendocino County so I'll

1110
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:15,240
drive from here where I am in Humboldt

1111
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,740
at our what I call our anchor Farm

1112
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,799
and

1113
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:21,379
uh drive down there with the film crew

1114
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,420
and

1115
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:27,660
revisit Casa floor because of course to

1116
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:31,380
do the way that we do it and this is

1117
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:35,460
fairly labor intensive but we go and

1118
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:38,519
take all of the vegetative cuttings or

1119
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,099
clones off every single plant down there

1120
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,239
and then

1121
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:44,460
store them

1122
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,699
keep them in veg and just essentially

1123
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,760
just kind of keep them alive

1124
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:53,818
uh until they're essentially about ready

1125
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:57,420
to harvest and so we then go and return

1126
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:58,318
so this will be our return visit to Casa

1127
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:02,220
Flor

1128
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:04,259
and do our whole rating system and I

1129
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:05,159
think this time tomorrow we're going to

1130
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,560
have

1131
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:08,460
we will have a video crew and then we've

1132
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:09,900
got

1133
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:14,400
actually

1134
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:17,519
our European team is visiting this week

1135
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:21,300
so we're taking them with us to help

1136
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:23,699
do some rating and Analysis and then the

1137
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:26,460
the folks there at Casa floor are going

1138
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:28,379
to be obviously out there in the field

1139
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,980
with us because

1140
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:33,119
the way it works is we'll give them

1141
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:36,179
seeds that we have

1142
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,838
interest in exploring so like

1143
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:41,578
seeds for exploration and and that's not

1144
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,759
so much the ones that are always

1145
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:47,700
commercially available to people because

1146
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:50,099
those ones are you know we've taken the

1147
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:51,659
time to make them uniform and consistent

1148
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:53,640
but

1149
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,879
the advantage for somebody like Casa

1150
00:49:53,639 --> 00:50:00,559
Flores for one thing they do a lot of

1151
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:04,500
fresh frozen uh extract so

1152
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,539
that being said it's not as detrimental

1153
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,599
to have some diversity in a population

1154
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:12,358
when you're doing uh a fresh frozen

1155
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,119
extract because it essentially you're

1156
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:17,719
homogenizing the population so it kind

1157
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,519
of averages out the phenotypic variation

1158
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:22,318
which is which is kind of great like

1159
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:25,380
because it gives you this

1160
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,960
sort of what the the cross or what the

1161
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:31,140
population created

1162
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:34,500
as an average when you sort of mix it

1163
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:37,920
together so from from a chemotype

1164
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,838
perspective we'll find out what that

1165
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,720
cross

1166
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:45,779
produced on average and

1167
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,219
of course then we'll go and use the

1168
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,579
opportunity

1169
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:52,618
in collaboration with Lou and the team

1170
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:56,880
at Casa floor to

1171
00:50:52,619 --> 00:51:00,180
find unicorns we call them or phenotype

1172
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,858
hunt winners within each individual

1173
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:06,118
group that we

1174
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:07,980
shared with them to to hunt and so

1175
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:11,160
there's some give and take like we kind

1176
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:14,280
of often provide those seeds uh free of

1177
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:17,039
charge as r d populations and then

1178
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:21,180
there's some trust that we have

1179
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:23,219
developed with the team there that you

1180
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:27,000
know they're going to take good care and

1181
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:28,799
allow us to come and take the tissue

1182
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,159
samples or the you know the Clones

1183
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,400
basically and and we have to tag every

1184
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:38,279
single plant individually and so we have

1185
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,639
to know that those tags are all gonna be

1186
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:44,940
there and be attached to the initial you

1187
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:47,039
know the the plants uh

1188
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,679
not you know

1189
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,818
goofed around or whatever and and so

1190
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:54,058
that's

1191
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:57,659
that's a relationship or a partnership

1192
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:59,220
and what they get back is they get

1193
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:02,279
some

1194
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:04,019
a cool video like if you folks want to

1195
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,500
check out other phenotype hunt videos

1196
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:09,000
there's a great Casa floor

1197
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,920
phenotype hunt video on our website

1198
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,199
right now as well

1199
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,680
from last year

1200
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:19,439
and and they get exposure but also

1201
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:21,659
they'll have access like the

1202
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,000
one of the plants that we picked from

1203
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:27,659
last year's Fino hunt

1204
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,199
um Casa Flores doing an entire clone

1205
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:30,199
propagated

1206
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:36,118
uh like a small field of that plant in

1207
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,280
particular and we're gonna go and and

1208
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:40,980
look at that as well

1209
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,380
so that's kind of like the instant

1210
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,780
gratification that you can get from

1211
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:48,780
finding you know

1212
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:51,240
a unicorn or an amazing Fino is that you

1213
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,559
can just turn around and and the next

1214
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:53,338
year

1215
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,359
um

1216
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:59,279
will often offer it back to that whoever

1217
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,980
whatever Farm it was and say Hey you

1218
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,960
know if you want go ahead and propagate

1219
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,960
the crap out of this and then you'll

1220
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:09,780
have kind of almost an exclusive

1221
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,599
market for this new thing that we've

1222
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:16,140
found the year before but the seeds

1223
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:18,660
themselves we won't put those out more

1224
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:21,239
often than not it takes us like two

1225
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:23,399
years to really feel comfortable

1226
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:26,699
sharing those after we find afino

1227
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:29,880
because you know that's we can often get

1228
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:32,338
at least two generations in a year and

1229
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,160
so you know it may be four generations

1230
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:36,440
later before we really feel like it's

1231
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:40,558
ready to

1232
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:42,599
uh be in the market as a seed

1233
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,760
that you know and that's four

1234
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,559
generations of of selfing right because

1235
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,200
you're not going to have a male to to

1236
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,000
breed with right right yep and and

1237
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,980
that's kind of what we're doing now but

1238
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,179
it's selfing with selection in between

1239
00:53:52,980 --> 00:54:01,139
and this is something that's like now

1240
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:03,539
I'm sharing some Trade Secrets and uh

1241
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:05,338
probably most people would say you've

1242
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:09,420
already shared a ton of them on this

1243
00:54:05,338 --> 00:54:11,759
interview but but here's one that here's

1244
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,338
one that actually I feel like is not

1245
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,260
common knowledge or if you picked up a

1246
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:18,239
book or whatever

1247
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,520
um so

1248
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:23,639
you know when you sell something it's

1249
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:26,519
makes a massive difference how

1250
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:28,199
homozygous or heterozygous it was in the

1251
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:31,920
first place so if you sell something

1252
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:33,598
that's just like a random clone that is

1253
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,338
you know

1254
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,260
you have no idea what really the

1255
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,759
background is like somebody might just

1256
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:41,339
say this is

1257
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,980
cookies times

1258
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:47,279
runs or whatever the heck

1259
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:49,858
and and all of those things are really

1260
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,619
very heterozygous

1261
00:54:49,858 --> 00:54:55,199
um if you were to do like

1262
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:58,019
you know an analysis of of how much

1263
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:02,818
variation they're capable of producing

1264
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:04,619
and and so if you take that clone and

1265
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:06,300
and you start your project with

1266
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:08,640
something like that

1267
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,700
then you're going to the selfing is

1268
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:14,039
going to create just a huge array of

1269
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:16,338
because you're really going to see

1270
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:19,980
what's going to come out of

1271
00:55:16,338 --> 00:55:22,799
self-pollination is Grandma and Great

1272
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,318
Grandpa and you know like just the whole

1273
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,180
family tree is gonna all of a sudden

1274
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:28,199
come back out which can be kind of

1275
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:31,139
useful

1276
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:34,259
for certain strategies and breeding

1277
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:36,659
actually it's kind of neat but but it's

1278
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:40,140
not specifically

1279
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:42,598
moving you a big step towards uniformity

1280
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:43,318
or homozygosity it's

1281
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:45,900
um

1282
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:48,179
so you know

1283
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:51,000
we have done so sell things not like

1284
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:53,519
it's not gonna those seeds that result

1285
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,039
from cell thing aren't like uh for all

1286
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:59,099
intents and purposes a clone of the

1287
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:02,699
mother it's no it can be just as diverse

1288
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:04,500
yeah it may be it may sometimes in some

1289
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:06,779
cases it can even be a little bit more

1290
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,539
diverse but it's a good step in the

1291
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,920
right direction and so

1292
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:13,318
um but what

1293
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,059
what the process for us it's what's

1294
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:17,460
really important is like

1295
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:20,400
there I mean there are situations where

1296
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,800
we've been doing sibling crosses for

1297
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,900
many years we already have a fairly

1298
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,359
homozygous line or maybe it's something

1299
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:29,579
that came from a specific part of the

1300
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:32,338
world that was isolated like a land race

1301
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:35,400
and so the selfing of something like

1302
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:38,338
that is not going to split the atom open

1303
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:41,160
and make a ton of diversity but solving

1304
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:42,960
something that's probably you know part

1305
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:45,838
of one of these more

1306
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,960
modern super high you know like

1307
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:51,299
poly hybrids that are just kind of like

1308
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,179
that will create a bunch of diversity

1309
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:56,579
and that's not to say that that's not a

1310
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:59,699
good way to start making a more purebred

1311
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:01,680
line it's just when you do that know

1312
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:04,980
that you're going to have to self and

1313
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:06,659
then do on Fino hunt afterwards to find

1314
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,420
and the purpose of that Fino hunt

1315
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:13,139
afterwards would be to find the ones

1316
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:17,180
that are expressing the most similarity

1317
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:19,679
to the pro the

1318
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:20,219
yeah that

1319
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:22,440
um

1320
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:24,838
so you basically have the Clone you've

1321
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,059
selfed it now you look through the

1322
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:30,900
progeny and you're looking for something

1323
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:32,339
that resembles that progenitor clone or

1324
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,220
the original

1325
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:37,259
and and so you know the assumption is

1326
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:39,598
that that one has

1327
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,800
a fair amount of homozygosity that it

1328
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,200
inherited

1329
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,200
because of its uniformity and and that

1330
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,259
could not be necessarily true but for

1331
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:50,639
what's important to us which is like

1332
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:53,579
phenotypic expression cannabinoid

1333
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:56,699
chemotypic expression it's probably the

1334
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:59,160
case so then then you take that

1335
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:01,318
and now you're going to self that one

1336
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:04,379
and and so that would be an S2

1337
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:09,000
generation and now you're gonna start

1338
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:11,579
seeing a a much much more uniformity in

1339
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,260
the progeny and

1340
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:15,180
but still

1341
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:18,359
you know if you had to do a final hunt

1342
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:20,279
for the S1 and it was vast and it was

1343
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:23,358
diverse you're probably gonna have to do

1344
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,980
a final hunt for the S2 and then

1345
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:30,420
now when you get further and further and

1346
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:32,639
here's the interesting part that is

1347
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,200
what I would consider a little trade

1348
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,779
secret is

1349
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:39,000
there's a point in which you have so

1350
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,019
much uniformity and we're at this point

1351
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,420
with

1352
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:44,099
quite a few of our lines now and that

1353
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,460
these aren't necessarily things that

1354
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:49,440
we're sharing now with the world because

1355
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:52,139
it actually starts to become deleterious

1356
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,900
to you know you're create you're having

1357
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:57,358
something that's too inbred to share it

1358
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,280
in and of itself you're but you're on

1359
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:02,039
well on the path to making a true

1360
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,440
breeding hybrid seed now but the

1361
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:08,099
interesting thing is is you don't you do

1362
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,240
selection maybe but the selection is

1363
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:12,059
actually

1364
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:14,039
if you look for the biggest healthiest

1365
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:17,940
happiest plant

1366
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:21,239
you're actually probably not picking the

1367
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:25,579
most homozygous plant and and this is

1368
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:29,519
where doing sequencing and looking for

1369
00:59:25,579 --> 00:59:31,740
homozygosity can be helpful and you know

1370
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,838
definitely it's kind of like a marker

1371
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:37,439
assisted breeding it's not exactly a

1372
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:39,298
marker but you know finding out which

1373
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,460
one of the progeny is the most

1374
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:45,659
homozygous and then moving forward with

1375
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:48,420
that ironically though it's not you've

1376
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:51,058
now I'd say once you get to like S4 S5

1377
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:53,460
you're no longer looking for

1378
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:56,700
the most vigorous healthiest plant

1379
00:59:53,460 --> 01:00:00,059
because that is likely the most heterose

1380
00:59:56,699 --> 01:00:04,199
I got the most heterozygous plant and so

1381
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:07,019
it's a weird switch that you have to do

1382
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:10,139
um and it's also around that time where

1383
01:00:07,019 --> 01:00:12,838
you're switching from like this is

1384
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:16,679
something that I would personally want

1385
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:19,139
to grow like if I was a farmer to like

1386
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:22,679
no this is something that I'm moving

1387
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:26,159
towards being a highly inbred line that

1388
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:27,719
is now going to make a true hybrid seed

1389
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,519
and

1390
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:32,159
so that's

1391
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:36,298
um like oftentimes we'll just sprout a

1392
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:38,460
tray of S4 type seeds and look for the

1393
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:42,179
ones that looks just like

1394
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:44,280
not the the most mutated one or the most

1395
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:47,399
terrible one but certainly

1396
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:49,920
no longer are we trying to pick the best

1397
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,440
it's just like you have to start

1398
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:56,880
picking the ones that are

1399
01:00:52,440 --> 01:01:00,720
average or true to to form and

1400
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,119
and yeah you know because

1401
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:06,118
you're working against it right now I

1402
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,798
gotta let you go yeah I can just keep

1403
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:10,500
giving away for much more than 15

1404
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:12,358
minutes I gotta I gotta let you go

1405
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,338
um but before I let you go I want to

1406
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:16,739
give you a chance to plug any social

1407
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:18,358
media websites resources I know you've

1408
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:20,098
mentioned a few uh during our

1409
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:21,960
conversation but now is a good time to

1410
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:23,400
kind of bring those up and I will put

1411
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,858
links to them in the show description as

1412
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:28,380
well yeah we have our website we also

1413
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:30,779
have a YouTube channel and of course we

1414
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:34,079
have the classic cannabis Instagram

1415
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:35,819
account that kind of is always in danger

1416
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,000
of potentially getting

1417
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:41,358
turned off but the website and the

1418
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,858
YouTube are really great and stable so

1419
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:45,980
humboldtseedcompany.com and YouTube

1420
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:49,558
channel is just Humboldt seed company

1421
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:51,900
and our Instagram is the Humboldt Seed

1422

no it's been a pleasure and we

1428
