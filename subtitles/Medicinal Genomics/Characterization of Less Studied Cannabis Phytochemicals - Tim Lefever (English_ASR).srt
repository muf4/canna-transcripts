1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,839
hey everyone uh I'm timl fever I'm

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,000
director of Discovery at nalo bio um

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,719
thanks to canmed uh for inviting me to

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,679
give a talk about some of the

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,359
investigative uh research we're

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:23,118
conducting on minor rare canabo in

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,480
pursuit of both neutraceutical or

8
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,160
therapeutic

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,359
development so I think it's obviously a

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,039
very exciting time in the canab oid

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,320
space um well certainly there's been no

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,920
shortage of research and interest in

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,480
developing cannaboid based Health

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,439
Products or Therapeutics um there's also

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,238
a lot we just don't know yet um and so

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,479
we've got this surge of interest in

17
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,599
canabo regulations are continuing to

18
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,078
evolve and research is is advancing and

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,558
coming out more and more and more but

20
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,679
there's still a lot for us to do um and

21
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,640
so we believe that the synthetic pathway

22
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,558
offers us an opportunity

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,719
so we can synthetically derive canabo

24
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:07,959
that currently cannot really be

25
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:11,039
extracted from any existing plant

26
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:13,839
genetics and so what we propose is

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
developing these synthetic Pathways

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
investigating them putting them out on

29
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,799
the

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,280
marketplace um and kind of establishing

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,079
the pathway for Botanical development

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,079
down the road so we're not saying this

33
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,959
is a separate Pathway to uh Botanical

34
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:30,078
development or that it's better in some

35
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,078
way it's just sort of Paving the way way

36
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,559
to justify the genetics on the plant

37
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:37,158
touching side of the business eventually

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,399
towards Botanical preparations that may

39
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,920
have better effects the Entourage effect

40
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:45,960
more um the the the sum is greater than

41
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,960
any of the individual

42
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:03,438
canono all right sorry let just changing

43
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:06,078
the notes on me here um and so while

44
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,399
we're characterizing these phyto canabo

45
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,239
uh for potential neutraceutical

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,560
applications uh we can also Leverage The

47
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,878
learnings from that data set into the

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,199
identification of potential scaffolds

49
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,039
for our therapeutic pipeline so at a

50
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,159
high level we tend to think of the

51
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,598
canabo uh as a nature-made

52
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,359
pharmaceutical pipeline that has a solid

53
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,679
promise but needs a little bit of

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,840
refinement through Medicinal Chemistry

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,000
to generate a hit so obviously as we

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,200
work on this approach we might find a

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,400
phyto canabo that stands up on its own

58
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,839
as well so we've built a computerated

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,158
drug design platform that's been trained

60
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,200
with critical existing information and

61
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:47,639
we refine it every time we collect data

62
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,000
and we recycle that information back in

63
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,719
uh so it's constantly getting better and

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,840
evolving and so with each cycle it

65
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,039
improves and the designs it spits out

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,239
given the parameters that we set

67
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,120
hopefully generate promising nces that

68
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,120
we can follow up

69
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,359
on so again this is just a highle

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,879
outline of how this commercial um and

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,879
therapeutic Endeavors are connected so

72
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,359
we start again with the canabo on the

73
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:18,798
left um we screen them computationally

74
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,480
and then follow up physically um and

75
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,480
then for those that have limited data uh

76
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,679
will'll undertake talks and efficacy

77
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,598
studies uh while optimizing our

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,519
synthetic approach to making them um and

79
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:33,359
protecting any IP that comes out of any

80
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,280
of that work um and if a phyto canabo

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,560
looks good through that entire process

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,199
we'll pursue

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,319
commercialization um and you can see now

84
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,839
moving to the right how the information

85
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:46,919
gathered on the phyto canabo uh can

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,280
inform our therapeutic program um so you

87
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,878
see that the early drug Discovery cycle

88
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,640
is very similar to the phyto canabo

89
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:57,199
cycle um again this is intentional we're

90
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,919
trying to drive efficiency and Synergy

91
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,359
across our platform um but you can see

92
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,958
that as we go farther into the drug

93
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,480
development pathway the assays start to

94
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,799
deviate to be a little bit more

95
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:10,719
traditional of a drug Discovery

96
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,120
program and again if we get lucky and we

97
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,919
identify a potential hit uh we move

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,199
towards pre-ind enabling work otherwise

99
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,918
we continue to revi revise and refine um

100
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,720
our ncees and again I just wanted to

101
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,959
provide this context of our program at

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,880
nalo uh before we jump into the work uh

103
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,519
that we did for this for this talk you

104
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,120
kind of have a have an idea and the

105
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,120
rationale for why we did what we

106
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,600
did um so for this first run through of

107
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:44,038
this approach uh we screened a number of

108
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,400
phytochemicals some obviously have been

109
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,959
more studied than others uh to get a

110
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,879
sense of how this process might work uh

111
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,279
tweaks we may need to make in this

112
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,439
approach going forward the predictive

113
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,638
validity of some of our models and then

114
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,800
just the overall value um and so given

115
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,439
the massive amount of data that we've

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
we've collected and and some of which

117
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:10,478
I'll show today I'm just going to try to

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:13,520
focus on CBC CBGB cbdv and Delta 8

119
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,800
thcv um I'll present the the data from

120
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,519
the other phytochemicals um and we'll

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,079
touch on some interesting findings here

122
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,079
and there but we'll focus on those

123
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:28,159
four so again as you saw in the approach

124
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,198
above what we're doing is is fairly

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,960
robust um we're Focus focused on

126
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,400
modeling and high throughput screening

127
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:38,120
initially to triage early and cheaply

128
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:41,120
kind of a staple of uh a drug Discovery

129
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,800
approach so we evaluated these canabo

130
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,439
across a range of assays and experiments

131
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,560
uh starting by validating docking models

132
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:52,759
at several orthosteric and alisic sites

133
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,240
and for today we'll touch on CB1 uh Mew

134
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,919
and

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,759
gpr19 uh we then screened all of these

136
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,359
phytochemicals in adme and

137
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,560
physicochemical

138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,800
assays and some additional models uh we

139
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,800
looked at microsomal stability in human

140
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,680
rat and mouse cells uh mdck mdr1

141
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,960
permeability kinetic and thermodynamic

142
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,000
solubility uh finally log p and log D um

143
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,959
and then We examined the activity of the

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,800
canabo in several uh across several

145
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,318
Targets in radio Lian binding assays and

146
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,079
functional assays and again this

147
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,560
overlapped with some of our docking

148
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,120
targets where we wanted to compare the

149
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,839
validity of our docking model as well as

150
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,478
get a sense of um uh inv vitra activity

151
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,119
at some of the other targets we have not

152
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:45,279
yet modeled and last but not least we

153
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,079
then conducted a invivo c Elegance study

154
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,758
with nalif uh to explore potential acute

155
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,159
and subchronic toxicity uh as well as

156
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,240
impact on neuroactive function which can

157
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,800
be used as an indicator of neurod

158
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,800
degeneration or neuro protection

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,560
so first up uh for the adme results uh

160
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,560
the mdck mdr1 permeability assay I'm not

161
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,360
going to go into the the weeds of of a

162
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,240
lot of how these assays work or their

163
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,840
methods there's just so much data um

164
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,439
feel free to find me afterwards and we

165
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,239
can we can get into the nitty-gritty um

166
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,399
but basically uh understanding

167
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,079
intestinal absorption is key for oral

168
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,638
products and there's there's many

169
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,758
different ways to investigate this this

170
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,160
is just the assay we chose for this

171
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,439
first run um and it Sim ulates drug

172
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,160
entering the bloodstream uh from the

173
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,800
intestine by forming a monol layer and

174
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,160
examining the permeation efficiency from

175
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,199
apical to basolateral and vice versa so

176
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,680
this model can also be used to

177
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,680
effectively predict uh the potential for

178
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,639
a compound to cross the bloodb brain

179
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,158
barrier so on the left table uh with the

180
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,639
green highlighted bars you can see uh

181
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:59,719
both isomers of thcv Delta 8 and Delta 9

182
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,560
thcv as well as cbdv were showing to

183
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,680
have the most favorable favorable

184
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,639
directional

185
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,199
permeability or the transporter e flux

186
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,478
and so by extension these are most

187
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,560
likely to cross the blood brain barrier

188
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,120
um however I should mention that some of

189
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,800
these compounds uh weren't very easy to

190
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,439
work with in this model and so we went

191
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,360
back and forth with the cro um and some

192
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,519
of these were going to rerun as you can

193
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,879
see there's some Nas there's some blanks

194
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:28,598
so it's it's not perfect and we need to

195
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,680
keep working on on some of these um we

196
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:33,319
also screen these phytochemicals through

197
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,599
an open websource modeling program

198
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,959
called admet lab 3.0 uh which is which

199
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,919
is a great resource uh but we wanted to

200
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,079
see how our physical data uh aligned

201
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,079
with what was predicted and you can see

202
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,160
there are definitely some discrepancies

203
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,519
so for example again CBGB seem to score

204
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:54,600
very well in the model uh but not in the

205
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,759
invitro assay um so the model may be

206
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,959
able to kind of get around some of the

207
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,278
method development work or the chemical

208
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,639
complexities of cannabinoids in some of

209
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,799
these physical assays uh to get to

210
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,319
potentially a more realistic uh

211
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,359
prediction or score more

212
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,120
quickly uh obviously we're going to

213
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,440
continue to refine both our in vitro and

214
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,039
in silico models uh to to eventually get

215
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,839
to the point where we're so we're we're

216
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,599
uh confident enough in our predictive

217
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,680
validity that we can skip the physical

218
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,680
assays for the most

219
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,278
part so here uh this is human microsomal

220
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,199
stability data uh again the liver

221
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,919
represents uh the majority of the p450

222
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,079
metabolism and so understanding

223
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,278
microsomal stability is crucial for

224
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,039
understanding the basics of metabolism

225
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,278
uh by measuring clearance and in some

226
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,319
cases identifying the metabolites formed

227
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:53,159
um this a is available across a number

228
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,680
of different species uh which allows for

229
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,480
comparison as well as metabolism

230
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,639
profiles to be noted When developing

231
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,480
early PK studies for drug Discovery work

232
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,759
um in general most of the cannaboids are

233
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,240
metabolized pretty quickly indicating

234
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,879
rapid clearance or conversion and they

235
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,039
have a relatively short halflife uh

236
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:18,000
which typically is is not a favorable

237
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,958
attribute of Therapeutics um however can

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,839
flaven a and

239
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:26,559
cbcv both had uh better profiles uh in

240
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,600
the human liver microsomes than the

241
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,838
other canabo potentially indicating

242
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,920
better stability

243
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,160
and longer halflife um you can see again

244
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:37,679
the difference between CBC and cbcv here

245
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,958
where the only difference in their

246
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:44,399
structures just a carbon that's that's

247
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:46,078
the only difference um so besides this

248
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,919
work we're also pursuing structure

249
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,278
activity relationships of a number of

250
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:53,439
phyto canabo and hope that we might find

251
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,838
some similar predictive abilities so

252
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,600
between uh the the changes in uh elal

253
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,240
tail length and the impact of binding in

254
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,839
gpcrs does that also ring true for say

255
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,680
microsomal stability or permeability so

256
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,519
we're trying to put this whole story

257
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,519
together and hopefully build up a very

258
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,839
big uh a very robust predictive validity

259
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,078
uh or predictive platform uh where we

260
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:20,920
can screen even more and more phyto

261
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:23,120
canabo as well as ncees we

262
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,639
develop um one more thing that we're

263
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,720
trying to do this data just came in so I

264
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,839
wasn't able to add it we were able to

265
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,800
identify some of the metabolis of some

266
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,600
of these phyto canabo and phytochemicals

267
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,439
um and we're working on adding those

268
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,600
into this modeling as well which is very

269
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,120
helpful uh for a lot of these because

270
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,278
they haven't been reduced to practice

271
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,078
yet in in other words they're not

272
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,519
available for purchase to screen in a

273
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:49,838
physical assay so again if you have a

274
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,639
high predictive validity in your model

275
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,600
that's a very nice way to get it some of

276
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,360
that data quickly instead of waiting to

277
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,759
to synthesize material and then put it

278
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,759
into an assay

279
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:04,559
um this is not going to surprise anybody

280
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:08,719
in this room but uh canabo are not very

281
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,239
soluble for the most part um and so uh

282
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,079
they can be a challenge to formulate

283
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,560
with and so to that end we wanted to

284
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,519
establish Basics both around solubility

285
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,198
uh for formulation effort product

286
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,799
formats as well as how these phyto

287
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:25,719
canabo perform under physiological

288
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:28,559
conditions uh so in general CBGB and

289
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,600
cbdv were the most soluble both in the

290
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,078
kinetic thermodynamic solubility assays

291
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,360
and had the best log P scores um which

292
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,599
for lipophilic molecules as many

293
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,120
cannabinoids are uh is a good measure of

294
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,480
aquous Sol solubility and membrane

295
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,240
permeability uh so if you recall cbdv uh

296
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,720
showed decent permeability and CBG V was

297
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,519
predicted to have uh good permeability

298
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,560
but didn't uh follow up in the in the

299
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,039
physical

300
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,078
assay again all of this work with the

301
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,799
adme and the pcam um is to say that many

302
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,958
of these assays are are intricately

303
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,879
linked so if you improve one quality you

304
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,879
see Improvement in another if you see

305
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,039
delerious effects in one you may see

306
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,519
delerious effects in

307
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,000
another um you can also see once again

308
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,839
though that there's there's a lot of

309
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,278
potential to improve these molecules

310
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:21,399
towards a more drug-like molecule or a

311
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,399
therapeutic uh that we can use in our

312
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,759
pipeline so on to the docking models and

313
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,879
again this this is a whole talk in and

314
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:33,240
of itself and this is the work of my

315
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,838
colleague medy hagus um it is not my

316
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,000
work so I'm going to try my best to

317
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,760
represent it well but um basically he he

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,120
validated these docking models using

319
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,519
cryoem um of the proteins that were

320
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,679
available and then he trained the models

321
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,360
using as many compounds as available and

322
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,120
then screening false positives to try to

323
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,720
get an understanding of the predictive

324
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,720
validity of these um his goal is 70%

325
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,199
predictive accuracy uh where we're

326
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,000
moving towards 80% % uh as our standard

327
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:07,120
it takes him about a month to validate

328
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,320
each Target at each site um and the

329
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,839
availability of certain uh cryoem or

330
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,399
Crystal structures or Li existing data

331
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,839
on ligans really kind of dictates which

332
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,639
targets which sites we can go after in a

333
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,920
meaningful way towards having a

334
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,680
predictive model um so for example

335
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:28,759
aleric binding sites ion channels the

336
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,879
availability of data on CB2 Agonist kind

337
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,759
of limit the ability of some of those

338
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,600
models to be more predictive than others

339
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,440
um but again they're they're all rapidly

340
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,040
improving data is increasing every day

341
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,759
so we're very confident that over the

342
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:47,399
next few years um modeling uh the the

343
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,560
the uh the activity of phyto canabo and

344
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,440
chemicals in general um is just going to

345
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,439
keep improving and

346
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,240
improving and again so this is just kind

347
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:02,359
of an outline of how we did this for

348
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,600
gpr1 19 um so he trained up the model on

349
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,000
about 1,800 compounds with known

350
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,759
activity we're able to achieve about 74%

351
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,480
uh predictive accuracy when he reran the

352
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:17,320
known gpr19 Agonist mbx

353
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,240
2982 um and again we used a very similar

354
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,759
approach uh for the other targets and

355
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,639
sites um with the CB1 model being the

356
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,360
most robust in our hands he's been

357
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,680
working on that model for about four

358
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,919
years um so that one's up to about 8 4%

359
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,638
predictive accuracy where we just

360
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,879
started adding in the MU orthosteric and

361
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,240
alisic sites and so their predictive

362
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,318
validity is much lower but again every

363
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,879
time we collect data and put it back in

364
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:46,519
the models

365
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,958
improve and so here you can see the

366
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,159
predictive uh activity at these

367
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:54,439
different sites and targets based on

368
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:57,198
Med's models at at each one um and so on

369
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,600
the top half of this table you can see

370
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:03,159
the scores for the phytochemical again a

371
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,560
lower score indicates predictive better

372
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,159
activity um and on the bottom half of

373
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,919
the graph you can see in those

374
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,679
highlighted colors that correspond with

375
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,318
the Target and the site at the top kind

376
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,439
of controls if you want to think of them

377
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:18,759
that way or or lians that we know that

378
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,959
have a very specific activity typically

379
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,919
very strong activity at that given site

380
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,198
uh or Target uh so you can get a

381
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,000
reference point of where the

382
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,278
phytochemicals fall in line next to some

383
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,198
of those very strong strong uh lians

384
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:33,198
that we we also

385
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,720
modeled so to help verify these models

386
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,679
then what we did is we went out and we

387
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,920
we conducted some invitro bioassays so

388
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:47,838
we pursued a number of different radio

389
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:50,599
Lian binding and and functional assays

390
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,279
um so we tested percent inhibition for

391
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:59,079
radio Lian binding assays at CB1 and CB2

392
00:16:54,278 --> 00:17:03,838
against cp55940 uh at Mew against uh

393
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:06,798
damgo and at 5 ht1a against 8 hydroxy

394
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,600
dpad uh we also then completed dose

395
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,720
effect curves for those four targets uh

396
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:16,119
in cyclicamp functional assays to derive

397
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,439
ic50s for Agonist and antagonist

398
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:23,719
activity um for trip V1 trip M8 and trip

399
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:26,079
A1 we used uh functional calcium flux

400
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:31,240
assays par par gamma we used a

401
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:34,119
luciferase functional assay uh and um uh

402
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,400
again across 10 concentrations but along

403
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:39,519
with the 5 ht1a uh functional data and

404
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,600
radio liant binding we didn't see much

405
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,679
meaningful activity in any of those uh

406
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,599
so I won't touch on those anymore for

407
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,360
the rest of the talk but again I think

408
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,599
for a few of the trip subfamilies we

409
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:53,519
need to go back and and look at those

410
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,399
individually uh because some of these uh

411
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,720
phos we we are pretty confident they

412
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,360
have some trip activity we may just have

413
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,919
not chosen the the right the right

414
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,158
family and the right sub family for

415
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,159
these

416
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,600
assays um again here's the here's the

417
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,759
invitro data we got back uh so on the

418
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,678
left you'll see the radio Lian binding

419
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:20,519
and the percent inhibition for uh CB1

420
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:24,640
and CB2 in the orange and uh green the

421
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:27,879
solid bars are at the one micromar the

422
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,000
uh checkered uh bars are for the 10 um

423
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,679
and then you see

424
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,640
in the purple um and the graph on the

425
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:38,519
right is the functional cyclic data for

426
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,159
those same targets um and so for the

427
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,839
most part our results match what's been

428
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,960
previously demonstrated um The Binding

429
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,720
effects are all concentration dependent

430
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,120
which is good um there are a few things

431
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,400
you know we would want to point out and

432
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:54,879
we want to follow up on uh so exam for

433
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,798
example again the difference between the

434
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Delta 8 and Delta 9 thcv isomers is

435
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:03,158
something we're continuing to to

436
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,159
investigate and pursue um and it may

437
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,400
help to explain some of these

438
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,480
differences that we're going to see in

439
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,200
the in Vivo data in a few slides um so

440
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,038
we're very interested in in continuing

441
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,600
to figure out what the differences

442
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:19,679
between those two isomers may

443
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:22,240
be um we also plan to explore CB GV a

444
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,120
little bit further um as the antagonist

445
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,440
activity at CB1 uh is intriguing

446
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:30,719
compared uh again to the inv Vivo data

447
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,720
that we're about to touch on

448
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:37,960
uh so if we go back and we apply that

449
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:40,639
invitro data that we just collected onto

450
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,079
what Med's docking model predicted uh

451
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,960
you can see that for CB1 on the left

452
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,678
where as I mentioned he's been working

453
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,600
on that model for many years the

454
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,159
predictive validity is very high and the

455
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,599
physical data is almost right on top of

456
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,640
the predicted data um but what you can

457
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:00,399
see on the right as I mentioned is the

458
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,120
very new Mew docking scores that we just

459
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,798
added into our platform and you can see

460
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,798
the the predictive validity there is

461
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,960
much much lower but again every time we

462
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,599
screen we add in it will get better and

463
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,600
better and

464
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:19,960
better so on to the invivo data so we

465
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:23,000
partnered with Neema life um to look at

466
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,279
uh acute and subchronic toxicity as well

467
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,599
as well as neuroactivity uh in Sea

468
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,038
Elegance um and this model has become

469
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,719
increasingly popular po as a method for

470
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:35,000
high throughput in Vivo screening uh as

471
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,919
an alter as an alternative to initial

472
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,519
work using rodents um seans are a very

473
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,840
basic organism but they share critical

474
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,038
Properties or conserve biology that

475
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,319
allow for translational interpretation

476
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:50,079
into

477
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:52,759
mammals so again we are most interested

478
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,960
in just understanding the basic toxicity

479
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,679
as well as the neuronal activity uh

480
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,720
effects of these phyto canabo of

481
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,320
Interest so the neuroactivity data uh

482
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,319
can be used as an indicator of potential

483
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,158
neuroprotective properties of a test

484
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,399
substance so in general speed and

485
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,480
movement of the celegans or the worms

486
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,559
decline as the organism ages um however

487
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,480
the addition of some compounds will

488
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,960
result in maintenance of this Mobility

489
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,319
or speed as they age or in the case of

490
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,360
some some test substances will actually

491
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:26,678
increase Mobility um conversely

492
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:29,079
decreases in movement May indicate

493
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:32,038
neurod degeneration orx

494
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:34,558
toxicity uh so briefly uh worms are

495
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:38,079
loaded into this microfuidic chip which

496
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:40,278
is uh the the blue little device there

497
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:44,599
uh they live in there in a in a growth

498
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:46,119
medium that is um uh mixed with the test

499
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:49,000
substance so they they're constantly

500
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:51,798
living in that and then each day the

501
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,278
fluid is flushed and when it's flushed

502
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:56,639
it stimulates all of the worms there's

503
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:59,159
cameras over each of the chips it

504
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,960
records their activity and then activity

505
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,960
is scored using an AI

506
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:10,480
system um so some of the results uh over

507
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:12,639
the course of the nday dosing regimen no

508
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,679
really no toxicity was observed uh for

509
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,559
any of the cannabinoids so what you can

510
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,798
see in this graph is the percent

511
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:22,558
lethality on the Y AIS and then up all

512
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:26,200
of the the doses um and all of the phyto

513
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:31,200
canono along the X and just the percent

514
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:33,000
lethality is cut off at 8% so this is

515
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,640
there's nothing really significant about

516
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,159
any of this yes you can see some Trends

517
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,200
but they're very very very minor effects

518
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:42,559
um which was very uh which was very good

519
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,278
news for

520
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,519
us it was interesting to note however

521
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:50,919
that you'll see that

522
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:54,879
CBC the The Limited toxicity that we see

523
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:57,640
is actually uh going up as the dose

524
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,440
decreases um again not significant but

525
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,440
something we want to pay attention

526
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:07,519
to all right are you able to press play

527
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,519
on the

528
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,319
video all right so this is what the

529
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,479
videos look like and what the AI

530
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,000
software scores so this is for the

531
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,960
control worms they're not treated with

532
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,679
any compound so you can see Baseline

533
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,360
movement and then you'll see this flash

534
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,880
of white light and that's when the uh

535
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,639
liquid is being flushed there it goes

536
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,600
and so the AI then analyzes the activity

537
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,759
of the worms post flush um and this

538
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,798
allows for a very easy visual comparison

539
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,720
across the doses and the compounds um so

540
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,240
we're continuing to mine this massive

541
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,798
data set further to look at speed and

542
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,319
distance change from Baseline recovery

543
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:49,278
post stimulus Etc um and we're also

544
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,158
discussing looking at the actual

545
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,440
individual movements of each of the

546
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,679
worms themselves that have been

547
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,080
correlated in the past to Maman

548
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,919
behaviors for example if they're if

549
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,918
they're curving in a very specific way

550
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:05,159
or looping those can indicate things

551
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,159
like

552
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,879
stereotypy oh can you skip to the next

553
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:17,278
slide there you go and and then activate

554
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,000
this video for me thank you uh so this

555
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,640
again is the same thing we just saw with

556
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,480
the Control Data except this is uh worms

557
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,159
that were treated with 100 micromolar

558
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,240
delta8 thcv which was one of the most

559
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,520
stimulating uh Doses and biochemicals we

560
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,640
tested um so I know it's hard they're

561
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,798
not side by side uh we'll look at some

562
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,559
more data but trust me that these guys

563
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:40,798
are moving a lot faster um and if you

564
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,839
look towards the bottom left going up

565
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,879
towards the right there's one worm that

566
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:48,879
just screams across the entire the

567
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,480
entire uh frame very very quickly and

568
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,480
there were some other worms that also

569
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,960
exhibited that behavior which we want to

570
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,440
drill down into uh that seemed to be uh

571
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:03,278
linked to Delta 8 thcv more so than any

572
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,278
of the other uh compounds we

573
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:09,918
tested all right so this is a little bit

574
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,278
easier to see these are still images of

575
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,759
the paths of all the worms in red that

576
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:16,319
you can see at the very end of the

577
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,558
observation window post stimulus so you

578
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:21,240
can clearly see that the control and the

579
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,240
CBC data are somewhat similar in their

580
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,919
overall activity compared to the

581
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,000
increased activity or the density of the

582
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,799
red lines that you see with Delta h

583
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,038
thcv um and uh caffeine which is the

584
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:38,398
positive

585
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:42,558
control and again the the uh doses here

586
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:46,918
for CBC and Delta H thcv are 100

587
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:49,278
micromolar uh and the caffeine is five

588
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,000
micromolar

589
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,759
oops there we go uh so this is I just

590
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,720
talk briefly about a couple of the

591
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,720
individual phyto canabo uh so CBC was

592
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,519
pretty interesting uh in this model the

593
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,919
effects weren't dose dependent or

594
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:05,398
consistent so it could be that we were

595
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:08,240
off on the dose range we may need to go

596
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:10,199
back and look at it again um it is

597
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,960
interesting to note though that CBC was

598
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,080
the only phyto canabo that had

599
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,319
increasing toxicity as doses went down

600
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,079
not up as I mentioned earlier and again

601
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,278
not significant but certainly worth

602
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,480
following up as CBC does have some

603
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:25,079
published data indicating that it has

604
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,319
some neuroprotective effects um so I

605
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,879
think potentially for CBC we may have

606
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,398
just been too low and we were at a

607
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,399
threshold

608
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,278
dose the increased in activity we

609
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,720
observed with cbdv on the other hand is

610
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:40,519
unsurprising given given the nature uh

611
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,360
of previous research with cbdv and

612
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:45,720
neural protection um which may indicate

613
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:48,678
that by increasing the bioavailability

614
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,759
and subsequently permeability of cbdv

615
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,679
relatively low doses could be

616
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,759
advantageous across a variety of

617
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:59,320
neurodegenerative disease States or by

618
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,240
using Med cam to modify cbdv to be more

619
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:03,519
uh more soluble and stable while

620
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,000
retaining the activity that we're uh

621
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,558
we're looking

622
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,960
for CBGB again very interesting it

623
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:14,960
significantly increased activity at both

624
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,960
100 and 350 micromolar uh though they

625
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,120
were fairly equip potent and there was

626
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,519
no effect at 40 micromolar so the data

627
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:24,158
points Trend towards a potential dose

628
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:27,398
effect but again may need to go back add

629
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:30,919
another dose um to round out the curve

630
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:33,158
um and again CBGB as we noted earlier

631
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,480
does have that small Trend uh in the

632
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,840
toxicity data but not significant it's

633
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,599
just fairly interesting that one of the

634
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:46,199
most stimulating canabo also exhibited

635
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:48,678
some of the the toxicity we saw um and

636
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,399
CBGB we think it might confer some

637
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,720
neural protection uh through its

638
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,119
activity at the trip channels uh though

639
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,038
we need to explore this a little bit

640
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,319
further as I mentioned we didn't see any

641
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:02,640
meaningful activity of of C C bgv at

642
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:04,000
trip A1 trip V1 or trip M8 but again I

643
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,640
think we need to go back and look at a

644
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,960
few more of the uh subfamilies of those

645
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
ion

646
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:15,678
channels Delta 8 thcv uh had a dose

647
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,480
response relationship uh it was stronger

648
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,440
than any of the other cannabinoids and

649
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,558
on several days even outperformed the

650
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,798
positive control caffeine um so

651
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:29,798
interestingly only the 350 micromolar

652
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:31,599
dose of the Delta 9 THC CV uh isomer

653
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:33,720
significantly increased activity so we

654
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,959
saw a pretty big difference between

655
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,798
Delta 8 and Delta 9 in this assay um so

656
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,798
again we want to continue to explore the

657
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,599
difference between these isomers and

658
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,720
hope to better understand what's driving

659
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,719
certain effects over the

660
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,278
other so uh to sum up the invivo data

661
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,278
again none of the canabo produced any

662
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,679
significant signs of toxicity that we're

663
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:58,159
concerned about most seem to show

664
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,600
increases in neuroactivity which may be

665
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,960
linked to neuroprotective effects well

666
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,079
CBC and can Flav and a had some

667
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,399
inhibitory effects they weren't dose

668
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:11,079
dependent and likely just require some

669
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:11,079
basic followup on the doses we

670
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,600
selected so to bring this full circle so

671
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:19,798
in order to ensure this approach for our

672
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:22,480
overall program works um we used our our

673
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:25,319
in-house CAD system to generate designs

674
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,519
based on CBC and CBN towards our

675
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:31,079
validated targets and indications uh so

676
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:33,839
far we've designed over 300 we've

677
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:36,759
reduced 32 uh to

678
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,158
practice and of those 32 they have

679
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:41,679
predicted potential uh both in docking

680
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:43,399
scores as well as in adme and PCM

681
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,880
properties and so what we're hoping to

682
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:48,479
do is scale some of these up put them

683
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,880
into invivo assays later this year and

684
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,720
then continue to refine and build our

685
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Med cem Library while also while also

686
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:00,038
building up more phyto canabo uh in our

687
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,039
uh initial screening process

688
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,319
process overall summary the modeled

689
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,599
activity was was fairly predictive the

690
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,278
adme and the pcam is in line with

691
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,319
previously published data for the most

692
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,119
part leaves lots of room for improvement

693
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:15,918
towards more drug-like molecules for a

694
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,278
therapeutic endpoint uh and the invivo

695
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,278
work coupled with the invitra activity

696
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:22,519
data shows several leads for us to

697
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:25,398
follow up on uh an interesting efficacy

698
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,079
studies to follow um and finally using

699
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:30,839
our model uh we were able to design CBC

700
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:33,038
C and CBN based scaffolds that are

701
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,480
already showing uh improvements over

702
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:38,559
those phyto

703
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:44,160
canabo thanks sorry I went over

704
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,159
[Applause]
