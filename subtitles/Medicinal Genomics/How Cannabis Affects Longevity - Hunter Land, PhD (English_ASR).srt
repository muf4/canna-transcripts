2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:17,399
all right

3
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:19,679
so what made you interested in

4
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,059
investigating how cannabis can affect

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,920
longevity

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,259
well this actually started out with the

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,118
conversation with the FDA because you

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,279
know with uh with the legalization of

9
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,379
CBD or the removal from the controlled

10
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,840
substance act the FDA had a lot of

11
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,238
concerns with you know what happens if

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,880
you take CBD for an extended period of

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,939
time so 20 years 30 years is something

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,120
going to pop up down the road

15
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:46,558
that could be detrimental and um you

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,079
know it's obviously very difficult to do

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,820
this studies with humans and it's even

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,980
difficult to do them in rodents it's

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,659
very expensive it takes a

20
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,959
you know extended period of time maybe

21
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:01,019
three five years to look at at lifespan

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,420
depending on that specific species one

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,240
of the I would say best pre-clinical

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,400
whole organism models is the C elegans

25
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,280
model it's kind of like the canary and

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,780
the coal mine model

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,579
the EPA likes this for toxicity so for

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,260
example if there was potentially

29
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,938
contaminated water

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,219
if they don't know what they're testing

31
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,079
for it's difficult to determine you know

32
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,379
what the problem is and if it's really a

33
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,478
danger so they may use C elegans and if

34
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,298
they die early then you probably want to

35
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,679
stay away from the that particular water

36
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,720
it's also been used

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,600
um in the International Space Station by

38
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,118
NASA so you know what's the EXP what's

39
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,219
the the you know what happens when

40
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,680
you're at space for an extended period

41
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,239
of time we don't really know what that

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,520
means for humans but we can look at

43
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,478
other animal models so that was really

44
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:56,640
the the start of this work was hey is

45
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,759
this toxic and at what level would it be

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,978
toxic and how does that you know affect

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,739
um you know the life of these in this

48
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,718
particular model

49
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:09,959
interestingly enough what we found is it

50
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,299
wasn't really that toxic uh until you

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,420
went to Super physiological amounts and

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,219
still wasn't you know overtly toxic

53
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,839
um but then we started seeing this you

54
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:22,020
know increase in lifespan and health

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,360
span we also ran that model with canaba

56
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,540
Gerald a lesser-known cannabinoid and we

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,959
saw similar similar effects so both

58
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:33,959
appeared non-toxic and physiologically

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,180
relevant amounts and uh extended

60
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,680
lifespan and activity levels during that

61
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,680
life so

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,319
um you know rather as it would now again

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,280
this is a model but as it would apply to

64
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:49,259
humans it would be akin to you know a 80

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,259
year old acting more like a 60 year old

66
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,878
in terms of health span measures so not

67
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,159
only did they live longer they were more

68
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,239
active through that late stage of their

69
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,639
life

70
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,319
so the benefits of Health span and

71
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,958
lifespan it sounds like it was sort of

72
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,579
just a a happy coincidence like you were

73
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,039
originally looking at the toxicity but

74
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,800
then observed um this positive effect

75
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,560
sure we we wanted you know we obviously

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,140
wanted to to find out you know how safe

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,360
the compounds were were but obviously

78
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,818
when you when you find out that there's

79
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,340
a potentially larger more profound

80
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,679
benefit then that's uh then that's

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,700
something it's certainly important and

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
relevant

83
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,818
um for us within the cannabinoid

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,818
industry

85
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:46,280
