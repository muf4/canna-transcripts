1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,400
okay

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,120
this is a re-recording of an emerald

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,240
emerald

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:19,118
conference 2020 a that i gave at an

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,118
agilent seminar

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,199
so this is a topic that's going to cover

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,719
um a broad

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,720
array of information regarding the

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,559
cannabis genome so there is some work

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,518
here related to a pre-print that we just

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,399
published

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,759
we're going to go over some of that

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,960
there's also some work here that's not

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,559
in the preprint

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,799
that describes how to potentially

16
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,039
breed for particular hemp genetics okay

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,919
so right now there are some usda regs

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,159
out there

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
and they're pretty challenging to to

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,000
address right now because they're very

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:51,198
strict in terms of levels of thc

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,480
um and we're finding that thc and thca

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,679
can be leaking from a lot of other

24
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,878
cannabinoid synthase genes and we're

25
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,479
going to try and address how to track

26
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,079
those genetically

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,078
and what implications that has for

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,920
pathogen response because

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,359
eliminating some of these genes means

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,320
you eliminate some neighboring genes

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
which happen to be

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,000
pathogen response genes and in some some

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,118
of the cannabinoid genes

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,599
we're going to touch on that but

35
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,159
um to give you some um some back story

36
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,239
here

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,200
this actually uh was a project that

38
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,759
started um

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,240
a long time ago a couple years ago june

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,118
uh

41
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,640
2018 actually we started this with uh

42
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,159
with a grant that we received for

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,200
cryptocurrency and actually was

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,840
snowballed

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
by a foundation medicine sequencing

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
report

47
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,599
for my father and i explained some of

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,640
this

49
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,798
at a at a pac bio seminar at pag

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
back in january when we're going through

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,880
a bioinformatics seminar there

52
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,640
um there's a probably recording that

53
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,560
floating around as well

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,239
but we had a sense of urgency this

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,640
because this foundation medicine report

56
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,679
was actually a mutation of a tumor from

57
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,680
my father

58
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,520
it was a prostate cancer that they

59
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,439
biopsied they sequenced the biopsy and

60
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,039
found that he had a b raph

61
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,798
k 601 e variant that's an amino acid

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,399
position in the b raf gene and when you

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,240
have that type of mutation

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,240
they recommend akt inhibitors

65
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,680
akt inhibitors that foundation medicine

66
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
was confident with

67
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,439
um of course we googled akt inhibitors

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
and cannabinoids and up comes all types

69
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,159
of hits on how cannabinoids are

70
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,680
um are potent akt inhibitors

71
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,520
and our father was interested in using

72
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
those anyway due to the fact that they

73
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
were addressing the nausea and the bone

74
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,598
pain that nothing else seemed to touch

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,439
so

76
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,199
um so we had a sense of urgency on this

77
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,959
project um and that urgency was

78
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,878
underscored in the manner in which we

79
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,120
uh funded this this is one reason why we

80
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,439
truncate this long title uh

81
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
into a uh speed wheat as being an

82
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,280
abbreviated version of all of this uh

83
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,359
scientific mumbo jumbo we have here in

84
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,360
the title but uh

85
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,640
knowing we couldn't jump to nih to get

86
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
funding this quickly

87
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,958
um we turn to a cryptocurrency known as

88
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,640
dash uh dash is a fork of bitcoin

89
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,640
technically a fork of litecoin which

90
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,079
which uh forked off a bitcoin but uh

91
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,799
nevertheless its code base is very

92
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
similar

93
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
uh the only thing they changed is they

94
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,318
decided to create a treasury so that as

95
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,200
a cryptocurrency grew

96
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,919
and they issued more of these coins to

97
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,158
the miners

98
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,839
they could reserve some of those coins

99
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,318
into a treasury that people could vote

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
on

101
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,878
as to how to distribute those coins now

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
who votes well

103
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,719
there's another set of masternode owners

104
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,479
in the network that if you hold a

105
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,000
thousand of these dash

106
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,959
and as a proof of stake of your

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,639
ownership the network you get a dividend

108
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,158
of um i should say dividend you get you

109
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,919
get you have the ability to vote on

110
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,280
on these actual uh how to use this

111
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,878
treasury

112
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,318
so the masternodes are responsible for

113
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,518
helping distribute some of the coins and

114
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,280
making sure that the

115
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,360
the instazon works and they and they

116
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,439
they have to keep up a node that's fully

117
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,000
functional and fast that can relay

118
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,079
uh messages or transactions very quickly

119
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,959
um so the the master domain owners get

120
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,560
some of the rewards

121
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,920
of the block awards the miners get some

122
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,680
of the block rewards and then there's a

123
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,280
treasury and only the masternode owners

124
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
can um vote on the treasury

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,360
they have to have at least a thousand

126
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,640
dash piece anyway long complicated story

127
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,640
this cryptocurrency is interested in

128
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,079
solving banking problems in very various

129
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,119
jurisdictions in the world and one of

130
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
the markets they're interested in is

131
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,920
cannabis and they figured

132
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,120
having a really good cannabis reference

133
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,639
is going to help with seed to sale

134
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
tracking and it's going to help with

135
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,679
building a good blockchain for that

136
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
industry so

137
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,680
they funded this um the crazy thing

138
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,798
about getting crypto funded by dash is

139
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,600
that every month your funding can

140
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,719
disappear

141
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,680
um so we were granted a five month um

142
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,759
grant uh it was probably roughly in the

143
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,519
70 or 80 thousand dollar range but the

144
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,040
currency is so volatile it probably

145
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,399
ended up being about a third of that by

146
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,759
the time the project was over we we

147
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,120
actually refunded a time period where

148
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,000
the cryptocurrencies were going down

149
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
quite a bit

150
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,839
so every single month we had to refactor

151
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
our plan as to how we're going to

152
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,439
sequence this thing because the currency

153
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,120
would change on us and there's one month

154
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,560
we nearly got voted off

155
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,079
um so it does it does change the pace of

156
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,839
science and you can see some of the

157
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,800
stuff that's been posted

158
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,079
um on the page is a cryptocurrency

159
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,600
funded genomics page of menstrual

160
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,800
genomics that we'll talk you you know

161
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
walk you through how this project

162
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
progressed and every every single

163
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,759
experiment has been logged in every

164
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,560
single experiment negative experiment is

165
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
up there as well

166
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,680
so all your embarrassments are online um

167
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,679
okay so how do you get this published in

168
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,800
five months well it's really hard too so

169
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,120
what we did

170
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
uh is we put it up on a preprint server

171
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,240
uh and then

172
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,079
invited people on the internet to review

173
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,038
it we put out a bounty a 500

174
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,680
bounty for three reviewers to be

175
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,038
selected

176
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
based on their credentials we put their

177
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,000
credentials online so everyone can see

178
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,039
that they're not uh they're not our

179
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,399
friends

180
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,079
um and uh 500 upon completion if they

181
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,758
completed the review in seven days

182
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,199
all of them were completely reviewed in

183
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,879
seven days right so this is a really

184
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
fast way to get a review done

185
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,399
some people call it bribing uh we don't

186
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,079
think so we think there should actually

187
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,758
be a price signal in peer review so that

188
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,199
a market can develop and that really

189
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,479
good reviewers will get paid more than

190
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,400
bad reviewers and

191
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,079
that it would become a uh you know

192
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,198
almost an industry or market for some

193
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,639
people so

194
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,560
um uh you know stipends like this

195
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,840
actually give people priority to work on

196
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,199
these things and one of the reasons peer

197
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,719
review is broken is that no one has a

198
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,478
priority to do a well or to necessarily

199
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,680
do it quickly it's all done on charity

200
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,120
right now so

201
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,959
this is a way to cut out some of the

202
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
journals and just do pre-prints and

203
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,079
and bounties but nevertheless it's

204
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,440
controversial and we weren't going to

205
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,719
end there we just couldn't get this

206
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,000
thing through a normal peer review

207
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,000
process let alone get the genome

208
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
sequence in a five month time frame so

209
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
we opted to do this approach

210
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,319
and we have since followed up with a

211
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,038
more traditional approach where we're

212
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,160
taking

213
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,959
that data and of course 42 more genomes

214
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,479
and putting it through bioarchive and

215
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,560
in the traditional peer review process

216
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,439
so okay there's a lot more data in this

217
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
and this is the day that we're going to

218
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,000
go over in this presentation

219
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,000
uh this this this actually represents an

220
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,879
entire trio that we sequence a trio

221
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is a sibling a set of parents in their

222
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,680
offspring okay so

223
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
mother father offspring in this case the

224
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,000
mother and the father happen to be

225
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
brothers so it's an inbred

226
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
trio and the offspring is uh happens to

227
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,598
be

228
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,038
a male and it ends up being i think the

229
00:06:53,598 --> 00:07:00,319
offspring in this case is a type 3 male

230
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:03,360
so with that

231
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,759
we've got five tissues of iso seek also

232
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
done

233
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,879
on on the jamaican line mother okay the

234
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,478
the

235
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,079
the strain that we're sequencing here

236
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:10,879
the cultivar or however you want to call

237
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,918
it is a

238
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,399
uh is jamaican line uh the tissues

239
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,240
um that we're sequencing with isoseq

240
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,719
this is important to sequence rna

241
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,240
in order for you to annotate the genome

242
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
you want to sequence the rna from

243
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,598
multiple tissues

244
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,280
okay now we chose to take approach using

245
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,199
single molecule sequencing to read that

246
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,159
rna because single molecule sequencing

247
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,919
reads the entire

248
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,919
rna piece in one go you're not trying to

249
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,519
assemble the answer of the transcript

250
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,879
with a bunch of short reads you just get

251
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,959
one long read that goes across the

252
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,800
entire rna in fact the reads are so long

253
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,799
now they lap the rna

254
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
multiple times they turn these rna

255
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,478
molecules into circles and the sequencer

256
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,479
reads it like a gerbil on a wheel over

257
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,719
and over again until it gets it right

258
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,318
um so the best annotations in the world

259
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,680
are done with isosec right now

260
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,199
all right that's the method of choice to

261
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,560
annotate a plant genome so we did it

262
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,800
across five tissues

263
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,598
we did four tissues with a methyl seek

264
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,160
program

265
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,439
or or protocol known as emc from new

266
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,520
england biolabs

267
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,918
we then did 40 whole genome shotgun

268
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,159
libraries on illumina these ones were

269
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,079
barely amplified and the reason we took

270
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,800
very care

271
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,639
exquisite care to keep low numbers of

272
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,919
amplification cycles in these libraries

273
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,478
is because we want to look at copy

274
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,478
number variation and if you start pcr in

275
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,360
your libraries before sequencing you

276
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,038
lose resolution and copy number analysis

277
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,639
and we didn't want to do that so

278
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:34,718
all of these libraries have have have um

279
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,759
umis on them which are which are these

280
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,680
uh these

281
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,360
indices almost like a dna barcode that's

282
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,359
put on so that you can do

283
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,839
you can do molecule counting and and

284
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
detect pcr amplification bias

285
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,880
uh and you can also remove it but you'll

286
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,639
see in the in the paper we didn't

287
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,120
actually even need to use the umis just

288
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,639
by using three cycles of pcr there's a

289
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,879
very very uniform

290
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,319
coverage across the genome and we know

291
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,240
that because we compare the coverage of

292
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,680
this illumina method to what we have

293
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,120
from pac bio which has almost no

294
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,799
coverage bias

295
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,480
we have done some phase genomics work

296
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,359
and some ont i'm not we're not going to

297
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,800
touch on much of that in this

298
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,800
presentation we'll save that for a later

299
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,319
one that's a more complicated topic

300
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,639
all in all this represents about four

301
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,160
terabases of sequences in ncbi it's 40

302
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,600
times larger than any other cannabis

303
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,679
submission that we can find

304
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,120
i'm certain that that that landmark

305
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,479
number is going to change in time as

306
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,399
i've seen a lot of

307
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,200
data getting queued up to go into ncbi

308
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,919
but nevertheless it's a very large

309
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,080
change in the landscape of of cannabis

310
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,759
sequence information that's now public

311
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,120
this is now public in the koji genome

312
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,360
browser it's also public in ncbi

313
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,480
and you can read this uh paper here at

314
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,240
bioarchive this is what we're going to

315
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,240
be touching on

316
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,720
okay so a little bit about terminology

317
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,720
all right so

318
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,120
when you're sequencing genomes there's a

319
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,399
couple techniques that you can use but

320
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,679
there's three in general that you

321
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,200
probably heard the most about

322
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,519
you've probably heard about illumina

323
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,399
often often um abbreviated as il and

324
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,039
then

325
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,559
there's nanopore and there's there's a

326
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,958
couple different flavors of pact bio

327
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,199
this pack bio continuous long read

328
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,958
which is running the molecule as long as

329
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
you can not lapping it at all and you

330
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,838
have

331
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
a much higher error rate that way and

332
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
then there's pb

333
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,440
or pac biome ccs which is a circular

334
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,719
consensus sequencing that's the gerbil

335
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,959
wheel that's when you run it over and

336
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,278
over again you get really high accuracy

337
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,039
and only recently could they do this on

338
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,559
20kb molecules and we're going to touch

339
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,278
on some of that most recent data toward

340
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,319
the end of this

341
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,159
that's what's known as hi-fi sequencing

342
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
the graph here on the left is just

343
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,240
demonstrating which techniques

344
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,799
give you the most accurate genomes and

345
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,399
that's pb ccs

346
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,599
hands down this is the gold standard

347
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,120
nothing touches it there's there's

348
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,680
exciting work coming out of

349
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,440
oxford ganapor and illumina but they

350
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,559
don't have the accuracy yet and so

351
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,800
they can be a bit challenging for

352
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,239
assembling plant genomes um they can

353
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,159
help scaffold though they may play a

354
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,799
role in scaffolding some of the

355
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,919
cro the um the context together um okay

356
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,679
we're going to touch on a few of those

357
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,439
things uh going forward

358
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,799
okay so here the methylation maps and

359
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
the messenger rna maps were done for

360
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,000
these five tissues uh the roots didn't

361
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,679
seem to want to cooperate with us for

362
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,278
the methylation map but we did manage to

363
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,319
get some rna out of the roots first for

364
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,000
sequencing

365
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
um and a couple you know interesting

366
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,679
stories here's the adestin um

367
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,278
gene that you can see across multiple

368
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,199
different tissues having different

369
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,278
methylation patterns and this makes

370
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
sense because the intestine gene

371
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,320
gets turned on when you make seeds this

372
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,120
is the protein that makes hemp seeds so

373
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,079
nutritious

374
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,159
this is the protein we need to

375
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,399
understand if we want to feed the world

376
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,240
this is a really important gene cannabis

377
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
that you barely hear spoken about

378
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,440
um but uh you can see we have rna

379
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440
transcript differences over here um that

380
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,519
are tissue specific and we also have

381
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,320
different methylation patterns and uh

382
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,959
why do we care well methylation is a

383
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
sign

384
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,719
that genes are getting turned off when

385
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,959
things are hypomethylated or red

386
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,040
when they um sorry hypermethylated when

387
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,638
they're red hyper meaning having lots of

388
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,319
methylation patterns it silences

389
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,519
transcription and you don't get rna out

390
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,839
of it

391
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,278
when things are unmethylated it begins

392
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,839
to turn on transcription

393
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,439
and you end up getting rna off of it so

394
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,560
methylation's involved in turning genes

395
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
on and off and so

396
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,479
it's always good to see correlations

397
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,838
between the methylation patterns and the

398
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,759
promoters of genes and the rna

399
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,160
transcription that's coming off of it

400
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,439
okay so a bit about rna so we take these

401
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,159
molecules of rna

402
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,000
and we clone them into a circle or we

403
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,480
put what are known as smart bells on

404
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,399
them

405
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,879
which makes a double strand of dna and

406
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,159
then you put smart bells or dna loops in

407
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,759
the end of it so when the polymerase

408
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,600
latches on with a primer

409
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,039
it starts lapping this molecule peeling

410
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
it apart and running around and around

411
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,000
them a circle this is known as circular

412
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,839
consensus sequencing

413
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,278
and the rna molecules are getting 50 to

414
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
100 laps now this is

415
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,039
running the sequencer that had

416
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,519
remarkable read lengths and as a result

417
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,679
we

418
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,039
could lap these things so many times

419
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,399
that we're getting q30

420
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:50,958
q40 dna that means dna sequence that has

421
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,958
1 000 one to 10 000 error rate

422
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,078
um here's the size of the of the rna

423
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,838
that we got out of tissues

424
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,278
um and then you can see the the number

425
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,639
of um

426
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,320
of genes that were discovered in the

427
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,440
process what we call these high quality

428
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,600
isoforms

429
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,760
um so any given gene can actually make

430
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,759
multiple isoforms because genes

431
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,519
have introns electrons and those can get

432
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,240
shuffled in various ways when it makes

433
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,159
an rna

434
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,759
the rna can choose to read every single

435
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,600
exon in the gene

436
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,360
and then afterwards it may get spliced

437
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,278
by the cell where it rips a couple exons

438
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,000
out or skips a couple exons and shuffles

439
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,919
them around

440
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,759
but that all happens in splicing the rna

441
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,240
so when you start reading rna molecules

442
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,240
you see

443
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,600
all the iso forms from a given gene and

444
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
on average there's probably about three

445
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,040
isoforms per gene

446
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,000
this is just demonstrating that if you

447
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,480
look at this curve here

448
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,360
based on the number of isoforms the

449
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,278
number of reads

450
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,120
as we sequence more reads we begin to

451
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,480
saturate the isoform discovery but you

452
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,240
will notice that this is not yet

453
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,920
saturated from any tissue so i would

454
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
expect if we double down on sequencing

455
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,000
here or sequence some more tissues we'll

456
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,278
discover more

457
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,799
genes than what we're going to describe

458
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,679
here but this is one of the first

459
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,359
surveys

460
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,799
um so the female genomes that are over

461
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,560
27 000 genes

462
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,120
the exomes larger than human that's up

463
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,239
at 40 almost 44 megabase exome

464
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,799
the exome includes on uh utrs

465
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,879
which are basically uh untranslated

466
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,958
regions these are regions that

467
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,000
include the promoter and can include

468
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,319
some of the terminators

469
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,278
on the genes and then all the exons that

470
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
actually

471
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,120
code for stuff from the first methionine

472
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,360
to the last start the stop codon are

473
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,000
known as cds those are coding sequences

474
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,800
all right so the exome includes the utrs

475
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,839
and um the coding sequence and it only

476
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,078
includes the

477
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
the internal exons all right now this

478
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,919
stuff is um

479
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,679
scattered or defragmented all over the

480
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,240
cannabis genome if you will

481
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,278
across 121 megabases so very large

482
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,680
introns as well

483
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,198
the genes are are easily disrupted with

484
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,399
structural variation

485
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:43,679
keith allen published some work

486
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,720
encourage people to look at this is

487
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,399
looking at a bunch of the terpene

488
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,759
synthase genes in jamaican lion and you

489
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,120
can see the different families that are

490
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,278
out there the family a b and c

491
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
terpene synthase genes and the fact that

492
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,879
they're um

493
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,440
seem to have long introns in all of the

494
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,360
family

495
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,040
genes there's in one particular gene

496
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,399
family that has longer

497
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,439
introns than the other and he's

498
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,559
correlated this with some of the

499
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,120
chemical data that they're seeing at

500
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,119
steep hill

501
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,800
okay now the male is very interesting

502
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,959
because the male is bigger the male has

503
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,000
another 100 megabase it's a tire an

504
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:16,078
entirely new chromosome the y chromosome

505
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
that the females do not have uh and as a

506
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,879
result of this we're seeing about 4

507
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,919
44 male specific genes that brings the

508
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,879
male gene model

509
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,000
in this plan up to 32 000 genes and

510
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,838
about 80 megabases

511
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
of this is why specific and about 30

512
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,560
megabases is what's known as

513
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,320
pseudo-autosomal y

514
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,239
the pseudo-autosomal region of y still

515
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
crosses over with the x so the genes

516
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,360
that are on the y

517
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,440
that can still cross over with dx are

518
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,600
important because those are traits

519
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,480
male-based traits that can make their

520
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,199
way uh

521
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,240
and and into into the x chromosome all

522
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,719
right now the the

523
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,240
the why specific sequence are if the

524
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,399
genes on that section well it's not

525
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,839
gonna it's unlikely you're gonna find it

526
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,360
breeding into your population unless

527
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,920
you're keeping males around all right

528
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,519
now

529
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,198
how do you assess whether these genomes

530
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
are done well the best

531
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,799
peer review is actually other people

532
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,239
utilizing this data in publications and

533
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,519
you saw that with keith's work and you

534
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,519
see there's another paper here from the

535
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,320
oarsburn laboratory that actually

536
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,759
ran mass spec not on jamaican line uh

537
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,399
even though this this image up here

538
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,759
makes you think

539
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,720
they ran on jamaican line what they did

540
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,079
is they got ms spectra of peptides off

541
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,160
of the plants that they worked on and

542
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,159
then they mapped those peptide sequences

543
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,838
to the jamaica line reference

544
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,159
and they're finding jamaican line to

545
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,759
have the most complete reference

546
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,120
we know that from just looking at the

547
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,399
assembly statistics we're going to go

548
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,000
over that a little bit

549
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,159
as to what assembly statistics do you

550
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,919
look at in order to evaluate the

551
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,360
completeness of genome but the other

552
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,639
thing you can do is you can do an

553
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,240
intersection which is what we've

554
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,079
shown down here in this venn diagram

555
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,320
which is that 98.8

556
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,239
of the mass spec data we find

557
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
corresponding homes for those in this

558
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,079
dna sequence information the jamaica

559
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,240
line genome

560
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,000
now they discovered 12 000 peptides this

561
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,440
is probably the first time they did it i

562
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,039
wouldn't be surprised if that number

563
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,480
rises in time as they dial up the

564
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,958
sensitivity of the instrument

565
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,639
or or survey different tissues um so

566
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,639
they're only seeing about 40

567
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,160
of the peptides that we see throughout

568
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,839
the entire genome but that's actually

569
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
pretty good when you think about

570
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,279
how many genes are actually expressed in

571
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,600
any given tissue it's rarely more than

572
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,599
that

573
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,879
so they're probably capturing every gene

574
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,438
that's present in the tissues they

575
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
surveyed

576
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,400
and if they survey more tissues their

577
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,439
number will probably soon match what we

578
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
see complete in the

579
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,120
in the jamaican lion genome mass spec

580
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,879
data brings other information

581
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,318
it brings oscillation signals that we

582
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,600
don't have in the rna it is so it's an

583
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,839
important tool to

584
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,839
complement the data that we've got um

585
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,519
okay uh that being said

586
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,839
the the rna data is probably more

587
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,079
sensitive um it is we can get single

588
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,759
molecules of rna sequence very readily

589
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,599
and i'm not as familiar with the

590
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,079
sensitivities in the mass spec but i i'd

591
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,439
be

592
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,199
i imagine it'd be challenging to get

593
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,038
down to single molecule levels with the

594
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,880
complexity of the entire proteome but

595
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,160
maybe that's possible

596
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,919
okay um so how do we start decorating

597
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,200
these chromosomes we don't really have

598
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,000
chromosomes right now we have an

599
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,840
assembly that has um

600
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,599
contigs which are just basically long

601
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,199
contiguous stretches of sequence and of

602
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,879
course those contexts are usually going

603
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,319
to break when you hit the centromeres of

604
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
the genome and the telomeres

605
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,519
because those are the ends of the

606
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,960
chromosomes in the middle

607
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,480
sometimes if you're really good at this

608
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,759
you can get through the centromeres

609
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,759
they're just now getting through the

610
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,599
centromeres on the human genome after

611
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,359
i don't know 10 how many years is that

612
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,038
now 20 years of trying to finish it so

613
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,359
um only recently have there been tools

614
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,640
to do tip to tip or telomere to telomere

615
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,439
assemblies and we're starting to do that

616
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
with jamaican lion

617
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,159
okay so decorating um the male let's

618
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,160
figure out what the y is what you do is

619
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,600
you take the male flower rna

620
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,160
those iso secretes you map them to the

621
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,639
female

622
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,240
reference right and then the reeds that

623
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,520
don't stick to that reference you map

624
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
back to the male

625
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,359
that decorates the regions of the male

626
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,000
genome that are unique to the male and

627
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,479
have no

628
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,079
home in the female this is probably the

629
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,759
part of the y chromosome

630
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,839
you might be seeing down here which

631
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,519
doesn't cross over with x anymore

632
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,119
this region up here the top part of it

633
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,400
the smaller part is believed to still

634
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,798
cross over with x

635
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,919
this one if we want to decorate it um

636
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,000
this is what we do

637
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,840
and this gives us the information that's

638
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,279
down here

639
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:15,839
and when we do this we find

640
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,960
regions of dna that amount to about the

641
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,678
size of a chromosome

642
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,759
65 contigs and one of the largest

643
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,038
contigs in the genome there's about 427

644
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,640
bosco genes in here which is interesting

645
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,798
so busco is a tool that we use to

646
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,160
measure the completeness of genomes

647
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,759
uh and it's um it's there's around

648
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,759
there's just over 2000 genes in the

649
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,759
bosco data set that they believe should

650
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,359
exist in all plants and you want to find

651
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,919
you know over 90 of those in fact

652
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,279
jamaican lines finding around 97

653
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,559
of those genes are in the jamaican line

654
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,918
reference and that gives you a sense as

655
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,319
to how complete the genome is

656
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,520
okay but some of those are on the y

657
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,000
which is kind of interesting

658
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,119
um uh unclear whether the duplicates are

659
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
not they might have counterparts in

660
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,678
other parts of the genome

661
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,440
but that's that's something to know

662
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,440
now the other thing to take note of is

663
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,200
this process isn't perfect right there

664
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,679
could be structural variants that are

665
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,600
novel

666
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,679
in the male genome that aren't male

667
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,839
specific they're just not in the female

668
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,440
but they're on one of the autosomes

669
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,038
and we'll touch on a few of those and

670
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,759
those would make it through this process

671
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,798
all right so this

672
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,919
this is a combination of both what is

673
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:20,319
male specifically expressed and also any

674
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,320
novel structural variations particularly

675
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,599
inserts that could be in the male genome

676
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,359
that would make its way through this

677
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,558
that aren't in the female all right

678
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,839
and we have a way to solve that the way

679
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,678
to solve that is with a whole lot of

680
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,038
whole genome shotgun sequencing which

681
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,240
we will touch on in a bit okay so let's

682
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,158
back up and talk about

683
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,400
uh how you build reference great genomes

684
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,400
well uh the best tools today are using

685
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,159
pacific biosciences tools um there's

686
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
also some oxford nanopore material

687
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,880
working out there

688
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,240
uh we're not fond of it at the moment

689
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,240
because of its error rate and

690
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,440
the cannabis genome being so repetitive

691
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,279
makes it really expensive and

692
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,360
challenging to assemble genomes with

693
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,960
zero rate there are attempts to try and

694
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,479
polish that aerate with the luminaire we

695
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,880
have found that to be somewhat faulty

696
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,960
uh just due to the fact that you really

697
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,400
can't error correct ont data

698
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,079
in regions that aren't mappable with

699
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
aluminum you get too much

700
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,639
too many reads that pile up in that

701
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
region and you don't really know where

702
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,520
they came from and so your error

703
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,959
correction is really a mirage

704
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,400
so we stick with the highest quality

705
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,919
long reads we can get and that's with

706
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,798
pac bio

707
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,600
so here's the dash funded female genome

708
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,679
this was then crossed with a male

709
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,959
this offspring was actually selected i'm

710
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,559
sorry it was a female

711
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,960
this offspring was selected because it

712
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,720
was a runt we were interested in

713
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,558
genes or deletions that might impact

714
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,558
yield and so we selected

715
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:33,918
one of the offspring that looked like it

716
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,678
was having trouble growing

717
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,759
and turned out to be a real stubborn run

718
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,440
with hyper hyper branching and whatnot

719
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,558
okay so we did we did tons of sequencing

720
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,798
for those who don't know this is like

721
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,879
200x coverage of one of these genomes

722
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,158
this is 150x coverage of these genomes

723
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,000
right we absolutely

724
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,919
hammered these things with more sequence

725
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,359
coverage than you would ever need

726
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,720
for a couple reasons one we didn't

727
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,119
really know how big the genome was going

728
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
to be

729
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,279
most other genome projects to date were

730
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,720
still below the one megabase and 50

731
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,480
number which meant they were broken and

732
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,079
not quite mature

733
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,759
most of the dna assembling people out

734
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,839
there in the world want to see one

735
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,599
megabase or greater and 50s to call it

736
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,439
in the megabase club and we're pushing

737
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,038
up to three and beyond

738
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
you'll see some later data pushing up to

739
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,720
five and eight

740
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,400
now this is really the most important

741
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,519
metric is

742
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,919
how long these contigs are

743
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,839
how deep they've been covered and with

744
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,720
what accuracy you have in the raw data

745
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,158
because

746
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,079
this is the information you're going to

747
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,280
look for single nucleotide changes in

748
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,960
that are going to make an impact on

749
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,759
protein function and make an impact on

750
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,679
evolution

751
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,279
we measure almost all of the selective

752
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,400
pressure by looking at these these

753
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,000
changes in snips

754
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,038
and you want those to be extraordinarily

755
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,200
accurate and the longer this gets

756
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,400
and the better these busco scores get

757
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,159
that's a sign that you're coming to

758
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,960
completion on the genome and that you're

759
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,000
doing it with

760
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,759
um with the largest number of

761
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,679
the most contiguous genome that you put

762
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,480
together now there are some other

763
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,080
genomes out there

764
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,880
that have 750 kb and 50 and they've

765
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,439
tried to

766
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,159
glue some of those contigs in order and

767
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,960
orient them

768
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,320
into a scaffold by using some linkage

769
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,919
information and breeding and that's an

770
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,439
interesting approach

771
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,120
the only challenge is the linkage

772
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,120
information that people are

773
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,558
are utilizing is coming from the

774
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,918
illumina sequencer which has really

775
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,279
short reads and the reads don't always

776
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,280
map very effectively

777
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,440
and so there is some confusion over what

778
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,519
the chromosome names are right now

779
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,880
in ncbi and we're hoping we'll be able

780
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,798
to address that with some of the data we

781
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,400
have here

782
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,480
okay so in addition to doing that trio

783
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,679
with pac-bio we then busted out an

784
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,000
aluminum sequencer

785
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,759
and and sequenced another 40 genomes and

786
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
in that 40 genomes was the rest of the

787
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,679
family

788
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,440
okay so uh one of these jail number five

789
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,840
which turned out to be the runt of all

790
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,919
these

791
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,439
uh was sequenced with back bio the rest

792
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,880
of these well it was and also got

793
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,519
resequenced with aluminum

794
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,278
now what you're looking at here we've

795
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,480
described in our canopy tutorial this is

796
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,278
the sequence coverage

797
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,720
over certain genes in the genome type

798
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,079
two plants have coverage across

799
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,000
all of them type three only have

800
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,599
coverage over cbd synthase

801
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,440
we don't have any type ones in here we

802
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,839
have mostly type twos and type threes

803
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,159
okay type ones would have only coverage

804
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,399
over thcs and phase

805
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,480
all right we also did an outcross um so

806
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,679
we've got some sequencing information on

807
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,919
on not just sequencing a cross between

808
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,120
an inbred pair but we also outbred it to

809
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,679
blueberry cheesecake

810
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,359
and we have some of the offspring of

811
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,320
those as well so

812
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,158
an interesting tree okay so now if you

813
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,678
look at the 40 genomes we sequenced and

814
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
you take those alumina reads and you map

815
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,038
them against the maternal reference here

816
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,919
you can see the number of snips that

817
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,400
we're seeing

818
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,679
compared to the jamaican line reference

819
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,519
so we're getting you can see the number

820
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,159
of snips up here is in the in the 12 to

821
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,918
14 000 range this axis of the insertions

822
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,799
and deletions they're highly concordant

823
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,640
with the actual

824
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,879
single nucleotide changes and you'll

825
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,360
notice all these type ones are you know

826
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,278
about

827
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,959
10 12 maybe 16 million steps apart

828
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,599
uh but when you get into the jamaican

829
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,120
lion family it tends to dip

830
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,798
and that's because these are all closely

831
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,399
related so of course they have more

832
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:05,839
similar genomes to their parents than

833
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,038
they do to anything else and so these

834
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,158
map that have really really

835
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,839
um producing very few snips

836
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,520
all in all we ended up with about 58

837
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,959
million variants in here

838
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,960
these are all mapped with dragon and

839
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,759
paragraph parabricks two different tools

840
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,440
for doing

841
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,278
hardware acceleration for sequencing

842
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,440
mapping um

843
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:24,640
and we kept these all down below five

844
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,038
cycles of pcr

845
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,559
with uh as we mentioned before so when

846
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,679
you have those pcr cycles done

847
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,200
at a really low number of cycles you can

848
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,798
count on the coverage information in the

849
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,319
sequencing to give you patterns

850
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:41,200
of of deletions and insertions what we

851
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,038
call copy number variations or c and v's

852
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,558
and what you're looking at here is a

853
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,440
collection of all the cannabinoid

854
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:46,720
synthase genes

855
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,759
i'm not going to say all but the ones

856
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,440
that we've curated to believe matter

857
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,879
and and of course these are all the ones

858
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,880
we found in the reference the jamaican

859
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,799
lion reference okay if you do another

860
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,480
reference like cbd or x or

861
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,000
purple kush they might have other

862
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,360
cannabinoid synthesis genes we don't

863
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,119
have right i mean just take a look at

864
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,959
this map you'd be a fool not to think

865
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,038
that because even looking at

866
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,319
this through the lens of jamaican lion

867
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:12,000
all these blue areas

868
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:14,399
are lines cannabis varietals that have

869
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,839
deletions in certain core genes that are

870
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,919
certain cannabinoid synthase genes so

871
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,519
all this blue space you see is just

872
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,759
gone cannabinoid synthase genes that

873
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,639
aren't in those genomes the red ones

874
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,759
have two copies and the the purple stuff

875
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,679
are haploid there they have like a

876
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,119
single copy okay so their mother genome

877
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,720
might have the deletion there but their

878
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,079
father genome has it

879
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,919
so you can see there's a tremendous

880
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,319
amount of copy number change here over

881
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,880
these genes and so we'd be a little bit

882
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,240
naive to think that if we surveyed other

883
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,799
cannabis genomes

884
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,679
that there might not be a longer set of

885
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,359
these genes

886
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,559
that the jamaican lion genome is

887
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:47,678
actually missing a few that we don't

888
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,119
know about all right

889
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,640
this is the reason why we believe it's

890
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,399
important to do a pan genome because

891
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,240
when you view all these genomes through

892
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,919
a single lens of jamaican lion

893
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,679
you're only going to see all the genes

894
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,440
that are in jamaican lion

895
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,038
in in the other genomes but you're not

896
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,798
going to see the gene content that is

897
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:03,759
novel to the other genomes that jamaican

898
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,000
lion doesn't have

899
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,440
okay and that's a very big number is

900
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,599
what we're anticipating and

901
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,960
and uh we'll show you that in a slide or

902
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,278
two forward when we look at structural

903
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,400
variations which are a similar form

904
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,119
of variation um okay on the right hand

905
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,798
side

906
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,479
are 82 different genes involved in

907
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,639
pathogen response

908
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,798
these are kitinases thomatine like

909
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,120
proteins or tlps your heroes

910
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,398
call them for short and then mlo which

911
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,719
is a mildew

912
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,079
loci that's been tracked down in hops

913
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,159
why did we pick these well these are

914
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,519
just genes in the literature that we um

915
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,039
families of genes and literature that we

916
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,319
know have been tied to powdery mildew

917
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,319
resistance in hops

918
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,319
and we did have some powdery mildew

919
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:43,200
resistance information from a couple of

920
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,960
the growers

921
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,880
the green lines down here are powdery

922
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,759
mildew resistant and the pink ones

923
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,320
aren't

924
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,839
and of course what do you see as uh in

925
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,359
the heat map like this you get a little

926
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,439
bit of a correlation

927
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,519
that all the samples over here seem to

928
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,399
have a pattern that's different than the

929
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,240
ones that were here

930
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,839
and maybe that is what is driving

931
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,839
powdery mildew resistance in these

932
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,200
so um it's a whim uh it could be that

933
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,639
all of these samples are jamaican lion

934
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,759
not all of them but a lot of them are

935
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,278
and that they just happen to have a

936
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,319
shared ancestry

937
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,599
and that this pattern of different tlps

938
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,839
and mlos

939
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,359
is just an artifact of their ancestry

940
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,000
and has nothing to do with resistance

941
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,918
well

942
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,519
what was really interesting to us is

943
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,360
that a few of these samples that

944
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,720
proven to be extraordinary powdery

945
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,240
milder resistant and aren't related to

946
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,880
jamaican lion

947
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,079
have a copy number amplification on some

948
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,720
kitinases

949
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,398
and likewise there is a thomatine-like

950
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,240
protein

951
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:48,079
that has been amplified in these as well

952
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,440
and i can't see this very clearly here

953
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,480
but we'll show you which one that is

954
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,480
going forward

955
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,079
but we took a couple of these genes that

956
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,079
were amplified

957
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,439
and seem to have have the most extreme

958
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,759
copy number

959
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,759
changes and clone them and the way you

960
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,038
do this is you've run a pca analysis i

961
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,960
don't have the pca in here but if you

962
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,720
run a pca analysis on this

963
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,558
the genes that stick out as having the

964
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,839
most signature in the pca analysis

965
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,278
are what we chose to clone and and to

966
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,839
express um now you also want to look

967
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:15,679
upstream

968
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,199
right so the cannabinoid precursor genes

969
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,960
are probably playing a role role in the

970
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,640
magnitude of cannabinoids they they're

971
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,038
not going to dictate whether you make ch

972
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,159
cbd or thc but that might dictate how

973
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:25,839
much you make

974
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,600
and there have been previous copy number

975
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,158
amplifications that have been described

976
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,158
by

977
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,039
john page on aea1 and we might have some

978
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,440
of that here in this

979
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,480
in this if i read this correctly and

980
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,200
there's a couple other ones that have

981
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,720
deletions

982
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,519
so we're keeping your eye on some of the

983
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,679
precursors that may be involved in um

984
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,798
uh in modulating the amount of

985
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,440
cannabinoids and the other thing we're

986
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:47,839
looking at

987
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,120
are the the trichome by refringement

988
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,639
genes which um

989
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,479
may be playing a role in trichome

990
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,320
develop in shape or size but we don't

991
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,079
know we're just kind of looking for

992
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,359
a lot of consistency in here in this

993
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,038
part but then you get down here and some

994
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,240
of these genes look like they might be

995
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,398
differentially

996
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,159
modulated um or have different copy

997
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,278
number and maybe playing a role in

998
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,360
trichomes

999
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,798
um so there's there's just a really rich

1000
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,319
set of information here

1001
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:11,839
and we by no means that we thoroughly

1002
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,439
mind this data set we've put it public

1003
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,319
because we think having millions of eyes

1004
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,919
look at this is going to be more

1005
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,278
productive than having it rust between

1006
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,960
our own servers

1007
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:22,079
um so um that being said we did we did

1008
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,120
comb through the rna

1009
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,960
data um to try and hunt down what

1010
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,798
which of these genes should be cloned i

1011
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,120
mentioned before we did a pca analysis

1012
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:31,359
that

1013
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,119
that populated a couple candidates after

1014
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,278
we had those candidate genes we asked

1015
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,839
the same question as well are those same

1016
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,359
candidate genes that the pca pulled out

1017
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:40,000
from a copy number standpoint in the

1018
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,918
genome

1019
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,919
do they also have a lot of rna being

1020
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,799
expressed so these are the cannabinoid

1021
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,399
synthase genes

1022
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,038
these are the different tissues and you

1023
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,719
can see that we do have

1024
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,798
we have some expression but it is pretty

1025
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,159
much zeroed in

1026
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:58,000
on having expression that is uh

1027
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,080
tissue specific for only a couple of the

1028
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,079
genes in fact the can have a chromie

1029
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,839
gene seem to only be expressed at least

1030
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,558
in this jamaican lion plant and in the

1031
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,839
males

1032
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:07,038
that may not be true in other plants

1033
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,558
i've heard of cannabi chromium getting

1034
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,879
expressed in female flowers but it's

1035
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,558
just not the case with jamaican wine

1036
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,159
at least the time point we we harvest

1037
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:16,000
the these uh this rna

1038
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,320
you look down here at the actual

1039
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,558
kitenases the tlos

1040
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,000
are the tops and the mlos and you see

1041
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:23,599
much different picture

1042
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,038
a handful of genes here that just don't

1043
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,319
care they're not on at all but you get

1044
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,558
down here and there are some heavily

1045
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,000
expressed genes in fact the most heavily

1046
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,398
differentially expressed gene in the

1047
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,159
genome are the kitinases

1048
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,839
that was a red flag to us in fact

1049
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,240
they're not expressed in the roots at

1050
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:38,000
all

1051
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,240
and we think that's because the roots

1052
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,720
want to communicate with the rhizal

1053
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,440
with the mycorrhizal and the fungi

1054
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,679
environment in

1055
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,200
underneath the soil it doesn't want to

1056
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,120
use kitinases

1057
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,038
that destroy microbes that could be

1058
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,639
doing nitrogen fixation for it however

1059
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:55,278
everywhere else on the plant it's

1060
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,360
expressing chitinases galore

1061
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:59,038
and we just confirmed some of this rna

1062
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,319
sequencing information with some of the

1063
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,038
methylation information

1064
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,240
to zero in on which one of these kinases

1065
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,079
we're going to clone and this is the one

1066
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,359
that got cloned and is sitting on place

1067
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,639
with fusarium as we speak

1068
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,719
there's some methylation patterns in

1069
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,080
here that we were

1070
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,519
combing over this is what they look like

1071
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,839
actually when you bring them up in an

1072
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,038
igv read viewer or genome browsers you

1073
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,639
see all of these

1074
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,359
blue regions and these red regions that

1075
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,360
are being silenced

1076
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,120
okay so now that we have these enzymes

1077
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,200
uh these targets the genome what do you

1078
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,439
do you take that gene

1079
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,798
you cloned it into a coli and you

1080
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,558
express it

1081
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,918
and you get the coli to make lots of

1082
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,000
this protein and then

1083
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,759
if you're smart about this you put a

1084
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,240
little his tag on the end of the protein

1085
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,398
this is

1086
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,000
four histidines which happens to bind to

1087
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,359
nickel very readily so when you're done

1088
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,519
making this protein

1089
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,678
you can bind it to a nickel column rinse

1090
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,319
it off and hopefully still have active

1091
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,480
peptide

1092
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,918
when you come off this this process

1093
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,839
doesn't always work perfectly because

1094
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,720
the tag sometimes alters the protein

1095
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,599
sometimes

1096
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,679
the e coli glycosylates the protein

1097
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,599
differently than you'd expect

1098
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,600
in the plant sometimes it doesn't fold

1099
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:06,398
correctly in the plant so it's a bit of

1100
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,158
a gamble

1101
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,599
and we got quite lucky on this gamble

1102
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,360
after we

1103
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,439
got this cloned and expressed we took

1104
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,158
the protein and started putting it

1105
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,240
through

1106
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,360
beta-glucanase assays these are assays

1107
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,759
that that have a fluorescently labeled

1108
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,439
insoluble beta-glucan molecule that

1109
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,000
after it's digested

1110
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,919
it's soluble so you can monitor the

1111
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,640
digesting capacity

1112
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,679
of a thomatine like protein by putting

1113
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,360
it through this assay

1114
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,720
for a set period of time you put a

1115
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,038
little bit of enzyme in there and if

1116
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,319
it's good at doing its job it will chew

1117
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:42,319
up that insoluble glucan that's

1118
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,079
that's fluorescently labeled and the the

1119
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,079
fluorescent molecules that come off that

1120
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,759
that digestion process

1121
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,439
are now smaller sugar units and now

1122
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,960
they're soluble so you can then spin

1123
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,320
down the insoluble fraction and then

1124
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,919
measure the absorption that's in the

1125
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,319
supernatant and you get a measurement as

1126
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,919
to how active your enzyme is well

1127
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,359
we have some activity from the enzyme

1128
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,640
that came out of beta glucan that's so

1129
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,079
that's very exciting and we've been

1130
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,440
comparing this tlp

1131
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:08,639
enzyme to some other uh

1132
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,838
chitinases and um i'm sorry kitinases

1133
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,320
and some other

1134
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,440
enzymes from a snail actually the snail

1135
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,720
one is

1136
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,159
uh is quite active um

1137
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,559
you can see some of that repeated over

1138
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,878
here we're playing around with

1139
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,878
uh tlp that came out of the inclusion

1140
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:25,838
bodies of e coli versus ones that are

1141
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,239
cytoplasmic

1142
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,440
versus a couple of the other of the

1143
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,479
other blanks

1144
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,480
and we want to see is that there's a

1145
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,240
high signal here this is the um

1146
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,760
the positive control is what happens if

1147
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,000
it's perfect and you want the signal to

1148
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,320
almost reach the positive control

1149
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,239
all right so um we're getting the most

1150
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,838
expression from tlp here and from here

1151
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,279
this one went through dialysis to change

1152
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,078
the buffer

1153
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,919
but when you apply these on to plants

1154
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,359
what you want to look for are now here

1155
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,799
are the jamaican lime plants that have

1156
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,918
the enzymes natively expressed and

1157
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,000
they're not getting powdery mildew

1158
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,920
despite having been placed it's in a

1159
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,679
in a tent surrounded by this guy who has

1160
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,680
it all over him and it doesn't seem to

1161
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,480
transfer even if you take them and put

1162
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,239
the put the

1163
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,159
the leaves side by side we don't get a

1164
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,838
transfer there are transfer protocols

1165
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,838
described by dr punja

1166
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,279
uh he has some protocols with certain

1167
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,039
amount of humidity you put these and you

1168
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,280
should get transfer from from one to the

1169
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,559
other

1170
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,320
now the other thing we do outside of

1171
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,358
these assays is we grow

1172
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,880
some of the endophytes from the plant on

1173
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,319
actual petri dishes now we couldn't do

1174
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,599
that with powdery mild

1175
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,440
powdery mildew over here because powdery

1176
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,559
mildew is not it's an obligate biotroph

1177
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,838
there's no way to culture it other than

1178
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,239
on a leaf so

1179
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,159
um we are working on foliar sprays and

1180
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,159
we do have some photographs of applying

1181
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,159
this um to the plant and there does seem

1182
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,679
to be some decay of the um

1183
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,358
the powdery mildew when you put enzyme

1184
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:44,159
on these i don't have those photographs

1185
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,519
in this presentation

1186
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,440
but they'll be posted they've been

1187
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,759
posted online before um

1188
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,679
but what you're looking for is you you

1189
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,320
take this technique where you put these

1190
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,078
tabs

1191
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,838
of watman paper you have to sterilize

1192
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,119
them of course right next to the colony

1193
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,880
as it grows out

1194
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,039
and right as the colony begins to touch

1195
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,440
those tabs you start adding in

1196
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,039
the amount of enzyme to see if if the

1197
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,480
enzyme retards any growth

1198
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,159
and here's the blank which is the

1199
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,838
vehicle control that this enzyme's in

1200
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,480
and it seems to not do much

1201
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,000
20 micros microliters of tlp didn't seem

1202
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,159
to do much on its own

1203
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,920
you add in a little bit of two different

1204
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,639
flavors of this enzyme

1205
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,800
and you start to see it turn blue and

1206
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,639
you put in a kitinase and a tlp here and

1207
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,320
you can really see an impact here this

1208
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,639
line of blue and the cheese

1209
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,000
this is a type of penicillium that you

1210
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,440
find in blue cheese and you can see it

1211
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,719
starts to give you that cheese like look

1212
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,920
where the blue is starting to change

1213
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,039
color

1214
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,720
uh and there's and there's an

1215
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,358
indentation on his honest growth in

1216
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,519
advance

1217
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,639
well we did the same thing with fusarium

1218
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:42,159
and aspergillus

1219
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,920
and the aspergillus didn't seem to make

1220
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,679
a big dent but we only did it with the

1221
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,680
top we're trying to get more

1222
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,759
kitenase so we do it with both and we'll

1223
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,559
see if the the cannabis kitenase

1224
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,680
actually

1225
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,759
fights fights it back a little bit

1226
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:54,078
better but with fusarium what you can

1227
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,079
see

1228
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,560
here is that in the high in the medium

1229
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,240
side

1230
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,000
of this experiment we're getting all

1231
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:02,879
types of disruption of growth in fact

1232
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,280
the pigment

1233
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,960
is changing this this discoloration and

1234
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,440
pigment has been published before when

1235
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,119
you add

1236
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,880
any type of miticide on here that or

1237
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,400
mycocide that might actually

1238
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,960
kill fungi the autofucerin expression

1239
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,400
turns off in fusarium and so you lose

1240
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,280
the pink pigment as you're starting to

1241
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,039
kill it

1242
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,160
so that's a great assay to show you that

1243
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,880
the enzymes actually have some

1244
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,199
functionality

1245
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,640
so we think we've got a good model for

1246
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,679
powdery mildew resistance in jamaica

1247
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,519
line

1248
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,960
we don't believe that we've nailed

1249
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,199
powdery mildew resistance for

1250
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,358
all cultivars because when you see this

1251
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,480
many genes involved in pathogen response

1252
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,078
there's probably

1253
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,159
you know a dozen different ways to skin

1254
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,519
the cat and there's probably convergent

1255
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,199
evolution where we see

1256
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,719
other plants have copy number

1257
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,399
amplifications of other

1258
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,759
proteins that we're not paying attention

1259
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,920
to or

1260
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,599
that just aren't necessarily amplified

1261
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,119
in jamaican line and those may in fact

1262
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,559
be another source of powder melody

1263
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,000
resistance in other plants so

1264
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,239
we can't claim that this is the powdery

1265
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,599
miller powdery mildew resistance gene

1266
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,719
for all of cannabis i don't think that

1267
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,480
will be the case i think we're going to

1268
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,159
find multiple different modes of

1269
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,000
of resistance as we go forward

1270
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,838
nevertheless we do have tools

1271
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,599
that can help monitor this while you're

1272
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:14,719
breeding to know whether your relative

1273
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,559
number of

1274
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,759
genes is going up or down in the process

1275
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,519
of breeding you certainly don't want to

1276
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,480
breed yourself into a corner

1277
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,599
where you're missing some of these genes

1278
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,240
now

1279
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,760
i do want to go back to tell you why

1280
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,159
that's important

1281
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,200
this area here in the cannabinoid

1282
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:33,199
synthase

1283
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,039
map here where you see full-blown

1284
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,719
deletions for a very large section of

1285
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:37,519
the genome this is actually the cannabi

1286
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,279
chromium

1287
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,358
cluster okay there are eight cannabic

1288
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,560
chromium genes in here

1289
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,239
it's labeled as inactive thc synthase in

1290
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,358
ncbi and that's because when they first

1291
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,959
discovered this they noticed it didn't

1292
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,639
make a whole lot of thc but

1293
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,240
it's believed that it could leak some if

1294
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,199
you take these genes

1295
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,879
cbd thc and cbc and you clone them into

1296
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,078
yeast and feed them precursor under

1297
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,240
different conditions they will

1298
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,680
promiscuously make multiple cannabinoids

1299
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:06,559
each enzyme itself is not a pure

1300
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,159
chemical reaction okay it has off-target

1301
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,199
effects thc synthetics can make little

1302
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,960
cbd synthase

1303
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,639
cbd synthetics can make little thc

1304
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,920
synthase and cdc

1305
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,519
is believed to be able to make both the

1306
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,639
others as well although it's less

1307
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,320
documented

1308
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:21,679
um so what else is carried along in this

1309
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,880
deletion well this deletion

1310
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,319
also carries on it's contag 756 down

1311
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,720
here and you can see anything labeled

1312
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,480
with contact 756 that's blue is in that

1313
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:34,239
deletion and these genes

1314
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,280
happen to be nip 1 tps1 pip 1

1315
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,838
npf 1 rmt and spa

1316
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,119
these genes are all involved in pathogen

1317
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:42,960
response okay one of them is an

1318
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,640
aquaporin receptor the other one is like

1319
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,400
a gibberellin receptor all right this

1320
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,480
this is stuff we can't like

1321
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,160
uh these are important genes that are

1322
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,159
really close to the cannabinoid

1323
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,598
that can have a chromium cluster and you

1324
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,519
can see the deletion

1325
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,640
has a variable stop point for each one

1326
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,719
of these cultivars

1327
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,480
not all of them have the deletion

1328
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,838
stopping at the same point

1329
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,119
so there's some heterogeneity in

1330
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,039
the three prime end of this deletion

1331
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,559
that you might want to track because uh

1332
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,000
it's very easy for you to breed for a

1333
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,000
cannabi chromium deleted plant

1334
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,318
if you want to lower some thc levels and

1335
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,838
maybe your type 3 plants

1336
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,440
you just search for one that doesn't

1337
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,400
have this and cross it and if it's a

1338
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,318
type 3 plant

1339
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,920
and you crossed across you'll be okay

1340
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,400
you'll notice a lot of type 3 plants in

1341
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,240
here actually have the cbc so a really

1342
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,519
easy thing to do is maybe cross it with

1343
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,159
some type twos

1344
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:31,280
that don't and see if you can lower your

1345
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,879
thc levels

1346
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,560
notice a lot of type ones have it as

1347
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,838
well not all of them but a lot

1348
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,838
some of them have at least half but

1349
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,759
these guys have a have two copies of

1350
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:40,719
canva chromium synthase or kind of train

1351
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,520
wreck and i think the other one is

1352
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,719
citrix

1353
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:47,440
or black 84. um so there

1354
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:47,838
we see them more in uh in the hemp lines

1355
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,920
than

1356
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,199
in necessarily the thc lines but these

1357
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,440
full-blown deletions

1358
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,719
are homozygous solutions are really a

1359
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,318
sight to see

1360
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,598
this is another reason why naming the

1361
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:58,639
actual chromosomes is going to get

1362
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,119
delayed because

1363
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,598
a two megabase deletion of this size

1364
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,200
would confuse you as to whether you were

1365
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,039
chromosome 5 or chromosome 6. the

1366
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,159
chromosomes are usually numbered by

1367
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,159
by size okay

1368
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,318
if one of your chromosomes happens to

1369
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,318
have a two megabase solution well it's

1370
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:19,119
going to confuse you as to whether it's

1371
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:19,759
chromosome similar size okay so pathogen

1372
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,400
response

1373
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,240
in cannabinoids these are important gene

1374
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,920
copy number events to monitor in your

1375
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,598
plants i'd recommend you sequence your

1376
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,000
parent lines so you know you have and

1377
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,800
then

1378
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,719
um you can probably aluminum sequence uh

1379
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,599
and even maybe do panel sequencing or

1380
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,399
snip chips

1381
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,760
on the offspring to lower costs but you

1382
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,440
probably want your parents

1383
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,720
done whole genome scale so you know what

1384
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,599
you're dealing with and you know what

1385
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,519
what cards you've been dealt

1386
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,519
okay now let's get on to the real hairy

1387
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,079
part of the presentation

1388
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,599
so um one thing you can do with these

1389
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,200
very long reads

1390
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,039
is you can begin to ask between the trio

1391
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,199
how many structural variations do i have

1392
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,838
how many times do i have a long read

1393
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:02,239
from the sibling or from the offspring

1394
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:04,078
that

1395
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,838
looked like looks like it's got a large

1396
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,720
deletion or a large insertion in it

1397
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:08,159
these are called

1398
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,399
structural variants now structural

1399
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,598
variants sometimes can also be

1400
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,200
a little bit different than a copy

1401
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,119
number variant although a copy number

1402
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,358
variant is a subclass of a structural

1403
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,119
variation copy number events tend to

1404
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:19,920
increase or decrease the copy number of

1405
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,680
the dna

1406
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,440
there are such things as balanced

1407
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,159
translocations and

1408
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,838
and inversions in the genome where you

1409
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,679
you know two chromosome tips swap

1410
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:30,880
copy hasn't changed but their structure

1411
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:32,879
has

1412
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,119
you know same thing is true with a

1413
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,039
balanced deletion or an inversion where

1414
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,318
something just flips on you copy number

1415
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,960
hasn't changed but it's order and

1416
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,119
orientation

1417
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,800
the genome has okay those tend to

1418
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,640
structural variants are a larger class

1419
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,039
where c and v's are just a subset of

1420
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,279
them

1421
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:47,279
all right

1422
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:54,559
so when we do this we see 17 000

1423
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,880
it's a heterozygous deletions and 9 000

1424
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,119
homozygous deletions

1425
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,400
in the male flower and and the offspring

1426
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,559
has even more

1427
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,838
um so this is actually a tremendous

1428
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,039
amount of

1429
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,639
variation that we're seeing uh in fact

1430
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,318
it looks to be like it's over an eighth

1431
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:11,118
of the genome and includes some bosco

1432
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,599
genes

1433
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,599
all right so if there is this much

1434
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,240
structural variation going on an inbred

1435
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,880
trio

1436
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,318
now granted i think this might be an

1437
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,559
extreme case even though it's an inbred

1438
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,559
trio i think the selection of the runt

1439
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,400
has caused some of this that this thing

1440
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,318
was probably an unstable genome

1441
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,079
and so we have a really high structural

1442
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,480
variation map right now

1443
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,318
but um it's quite surprising that it can

1444
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,760
happen in just a matter of 12 seeds one

1445
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,358
of them is a runt and we have all the

1446
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,319
structural variation that's that's quite

1447
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:40,318
remarkable

1448
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:42,239
likewise all of the illumina data on the

1449
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,000
other 40 genomes supports lots of copy

1450
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,598
number variation so it kind of implies

1451
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,800
this isn't really unique to our

1452
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,480
situation here

1453
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,560
that there is in fact a lot of genome

1454
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,760
plasticity in cannabis

1455
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,519
uh to give you some perspective the

1456
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,480
human genomes have like seven events per

1457
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,599
megabase

1458
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,800
in sv and uh they have maybe a similar

1459
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,400
number of events but they tend to be

1460
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,359
much smaller they're only one percent of

1461
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,800
the genome

1462
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,159
all right we're upwards to twelve

1463
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,560
percent of the genome so this is a much

1464
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,719
harder problem in cannabis than human

1465
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,078
now um so that makes you think how can

1466
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:10,879
you pick a single reference well you

1467
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,318
really can't

1468
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,079
but if you're forced to pick a single

1469
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,199
reference there are some criteria that

1470
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,440
you should think about

1471
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:20,078
in picking them um at the moment if you

1472
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,318
go to ncbi it will probably graduate

1473
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,240
anyone who's dared call chromosomes and

1474
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:25,838
cannabis and a couple people have tried

1475
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,439
and as a result the three genomes that

1476
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,039
are in there and none of them agree on

1477
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,559
the chromosome nomenclature all right

1478
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,400
and i'm not surprised that's because i

1479
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:33,920
think there's still some chromosome

1480
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,680
misassemblies that are going on but

1481
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,599
there's also probably lots of structural

1482
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,199
variation between the biological samples

1483
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,359
that make these things

1484
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:42,719
very difficult to discern one chromosome

1485
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,318
from the other so

1486
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:45,679
eventually we'll be no getting the

1487
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:47,039
nomenclature right in these based on

1488
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:48,960
what genes or what tend to be in which

1489
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,759
chromosomes and probably not stick

1490
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,400
get get so hung up on the size but at

1491
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,160
the moment

1492
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,440
we've got a bit of a chromosome mess

1493
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,399
going on in there

1494
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,838
now in light of that the chromosome

1495
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,599
scaffolding information doesn't really

1496
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,039
hold a lot of quality information when

1497
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,400
you take contigs and you link them

1498
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,838
together with linkage maps you don't

1499
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,318
have a real quality score

1500
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,400
on what is that scaffold made of it's

1501
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,239
just an association that we think this

1502
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,160
content is next to this one

1503
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,679
but you can't put a probability on it

1504
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,559
right whereas the

1505
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,318
the sequencing information itself you

1506
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:21,679
have quality scores at every single base

1507
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,279
that you can put a probability of

1508
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,879
correctness on so that's the underlying

1509
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,880
data that's most important and you want

1510
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,119
to make sure that that data is the most

1511
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,880
contiguous as possible

1512
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,480
you can easily play some shell games in

1513
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,400
sequencing where you report

1514
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,079
really large scaffolding and 50s but

1515
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,680
they're based on chromosome or on

1516
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,280
contents that are extremely small and

1517
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,679
those tend to be very poor

1518
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,880
poorly constructed genomes okay the

1519
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,318
other thing you want to look at are the

1520
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,000
bosco scores you want to make sure those

1521
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:47,599
are as high as possible you also want to

1522
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,800
look at how much depth of coverage the

1523
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,079
genomes has and

1524
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,599
as we've shown you um we we tend to have

1525
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,119
much higher coverage than anyone who's

1526
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,200
ever made a stab at this before

1527
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,559
100 to 200x coverage is not

1528
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,598
traditionally getting done

1529
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,719
so there is uh there's far more raw

1530
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,280
sequence data

1531
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,959
on um on jamaican line than there is on

1532
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,560
anything else that's in there

1533
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,559
okay we also have some some high c data

1534
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,559
that we can use to call chromosomes

1535
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,318
however when we've done that we've just

1536
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,679
realized that our chromosomes disagree

1537
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:19,119
with theirs as well and so

1538
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,598
we've got the problem of the fourth

1539
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,400
watchmen where we're not adding any more

1540
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,519
um we're not adding any more contiguity

1541
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,880
necessary to the equation we're just

1542
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,480
adding more confusion so we've opted not

1543
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,318
to put that data public until we get it

1544
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,000
done on a couple different technologies

1545
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:33,519
so that we can really confidently call

1546
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,440
what the chromosomes are in

1547
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:36,639
in jamaican line and they still might be

1548
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,119
different than what we find in the other

1549
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,960
lines just due to biological diversity

1550
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,240
but nevertheless um we don't want to add

1551
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,639
to the chromosome confusion at the

1552
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:44,719
moment

1553
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,480
so okay what are the other things that

1554
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,078
are key to making a gold standard

1555
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,800
reference well

1556
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,760
you want to get both a male and a female

1557
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,480
genome

1558
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,200
um sequenced because we just showed you

1559
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,318
the male chrome

1560
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:57,598
the y chromosomes the largest

1561
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:58,559
chromosomes you gotta have a why in your

1562
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,838
reference all right

1563
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,920
the other thing you want to do is get a

1564
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,440
trio because you need to to train your

1565
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,960
genotypers right now

1566
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,318
the genotyping software out there has

1567
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,079
all been written for human which is

1568
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,519
expecting a variant every thousand bases

1569
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,800
and we happen to have a variance every

1570
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:12,559
50 bases in cannabis

1571
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,839
and those genotyping tools all need to

1572
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,639
be retrained and the way that you

1573
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:16,400
retrain them

1574
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,159
is to sequence a mother father and an

1575
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,240
offspring what's known as a trio

1576
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,920
so that you can segregate sequencing

1577
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,159
errors and confirm

1578
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,079
whether or not they exist in the parents

1579
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,078
if a sequencing error is found in one

1580
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,000
line and doesn't exist in the parents

1581
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,079
it doesn't pass a mendel check that

1582
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,920
makes no biological sense you

1583
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,200
flag it as an error and now you can

1584
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,280
count your errors

1585
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,279
versus all the genotypes that you have

1586
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,000
that have mendelian concordance between

1587
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,280
the parents

1588
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,280
this mental check thing is very

1589
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,280
important for for gauging genotyping

1590
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,960
accuracy and it's only been done to date

1591
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,960
on jamaican line

1592
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,079
okay the other thing you want is a type

1593
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,760
2 plant something has both thc and cbd

1594
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,440
genes in this you don't you do not want

1595
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,480
a type 3 plant as a reference because if

1596
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,280
you sequence

1597
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,800
a genome for a client and you map it to

1598
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,599
a reference that doesn't have thc

1599
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,760
synthase

1600
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,000
and you fail to detect that their plant

1601
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,839
could potentially make thc synthase

1602
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,599
then the criminal negligence charges

1603
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:11,440
that the usda might throw out the grower

1604
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,240
are going to roll uphill to you

1605
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,358
so no sequence provider chip

1606
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:18,479
manufacturer

1607
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:20,318
or or or tool provider

1608
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,679
in the space wants to touch a reference

1609
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:23,519
that doesn't have thc synthesis in it

1610
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,759
because they have to be able to detect

1611
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,719
whether the reference has that that's

1612
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,920
probably the number one thing in

1613
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:29,838
cannabis you've got to detect given

1614
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,200
there's criminal negligence for 0.5

1615
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:34,558
thc or higher got fthc as i mentioned

1616
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,759
before you want the longest reads the

1617
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,519
most recent chemistry

1618
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,520
the deepest coverage and we've got that

1619
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:40,960
with sql 2 and with hi-fi data we're the

1620
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:43,039
only one who's done a cannabis genome on

1621
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,920
hifi data the data is already public

1622
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,880
free use it you also want to get your

1623
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,960
rna

1624
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,800
annotation from the same genome that you

1625
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,159
assembled many of the other genomes out

1626
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,160
there are taking

1627
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,558
rna sequencing from other plants and

1628
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,159
applying it to theirs to call the genes

1629
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,760
that's noisier you get all the different

1630
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,679
you get different snips involved you get

1631
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,000
different structural variations involved

1632
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,239
and

1633
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,920
it's harder to do gene annotation with

1634
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,318
the different organisms

1635
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,680
uh or different plants rna it's really

1636
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:11,358
much better to get it from the

1637
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,879
the plant that you sequence the genome

1638
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,558
from and we have that with jamaican lion

1639
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,519
we've got methylation information and on

1640
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,519
top of that

1641
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,039
more cannabis data is mapped to jamaica

1642
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,519
line than any other cultivar there are

1643
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,358
47 whole genome shotguns now in the koji

1644
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:24,800
genome browser with bam files

1645
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:27,279
that's after mapping so you don't have

1646
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,800
to remap the data and we've also loaded

1647
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,359
over 50 strain seeks in there and

1648
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,359
there's another 300 on their way

1649
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,119
so this has two genomes that are

1650
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,440
certified in koji the male

1651
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,559
and the father are the i'm sorry the

1652
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,880
mother and the father

1653
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,160
um and the offspring's up there as well

1654
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,480
so there's a trio up there

1655
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,159
in in koji for you to work with okay now

1656
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,199
let's go beyond this let's actually take

1657
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,838
this to

1658
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,598
doing better assemblies um so since we

1659
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:52,880
put all this data out this is stepping

1660
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,519
into stuff that we haven't completely

1661
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,519
published yet

1662
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:59,679
although the data is public for you to

1663
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,880
use it's not been put into paper yet

1664
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:03,358
um this is what's known as a can

1665
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,160
assemblathon um something happened uh

1666
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,239
this year

1667
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,279
that was a bit of a paradigm shift in

1668
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,598
dna sequencing

1669
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,440
all right pac bio finally got the read

1670
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,359
lengths out to 180 kb

1671
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,039
which meant that they could lap a 20kb

1672
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:18,159
molecule nine times

1673
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:19,440
and in doing so they can get q30 data on

1674
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:21,598
20 kb molecules

1675
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,200
no one's ever had that before and that

1676
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,119
completely changes the way that you

1677
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,039
write dna assemblers and so all the

1678
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,960
leading dna assembly people in the world

1679
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,079
realized this and immediately rewrote

1680
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,079
their assemblers

1681
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,680
three new assemblers came out this year

1682
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,800
we have something called hi asm from

1683
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:36,799
henley at the broad

1684
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,839
he's one of the more prominent um

1685
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,200
software

1686
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:41,679
authors for a lot of the stuff in the

1687
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,960
field he wrote a bwa in a variety of

1688
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:46,000
great tools

1689
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,519
um sergey korin wrote canoe which is one

1690
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,599
of the more popular dna assemblers out

1691
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,358
there he rewrote that specifically to

1692
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,800
handle pak bio's new data form because

1693
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:55,920
he was so excited about it

1694
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,480
great conception at um pac bio has also

1695
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,159
um re-rigged the falcon assembler to

1696
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,838
better handle this data and jason chen

1697
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:02,639
who was a former author of the falcon

1698
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,119
assembler

1699
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,480
rewrote an algorithm altogether called

1700
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,160
the peregrine assembler that takes a

1701
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,679
completely different assembly approach

1702
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,879
knowing it has accurate data and you're

1703
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:11,759
going to see some of that it's quite

1704
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,519
remarkable

1705
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,920
so what you're seeing here is just

1706
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,519
different stringencies applied

1707
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,200
in the assembly to try to phase the

1708
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,039
genome you can start to peel

1709
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,118
the mother and when you do a assembly

1710
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,279
like this all of the reeds from your

1711
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,838
genome get assembled and your mother and

1712
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,839
father

1713
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,078
reads sometimes for the same chromosome

1714
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,480
gets stuck together they get collapsed

1715
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,480
and the job at the end of assembly is to

1716
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,440
phase those or split them apart into

1717
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,838
mother and father

1718
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,679
lines and that can be challenging if the

1719
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:41,440
mother and the father genome are so

1720
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,759
similar that they don't there's no

1721
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,440
differences upon which to split them

1722
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,520
or or if they're hyper polymorphic they

1723
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,559
easily separate into two unique pieces

1724
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:50,079
of sequence all right

1725
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,760
so in order to do this you set different

1726
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,640
stringencies of

1727
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,599
uh of of this is called the minimum

1728
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:57,679
percent identity

1729
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,359
uh to actually purge and split these

1730
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,118
happel takes and this is just greg doing

1731
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:01,759
eight different or what was it one two

1732
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,519
three four

1733
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,960
five six seven eight nine nine different

1734
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,559
assemblies on falcon

1735
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,880
uh there's a ton of compute power put

1736
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,119
into this slide um to give us

1737
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,280
um different types of assemblies you can

1738
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:17,119
see some of the ones like the 99.9

1739
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:20,160
purged are giving us six mega 50s and

1740
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,280
you can measure the amount of duplicated

1741
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,399
genes that you see

1742
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,760
in the busco um score to get us a sense

1743
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,639
of how well you're purging a lot of

1744
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,680
these jeans

1745
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,239
and how well you're splitting the

1746
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:33,440
assembly um but anyway

1747
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:35,199
uh this was all done on what is known as

1748
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,159
hifi this is the latest chemistry from

1749
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:40,960
pac bio we got early access to it and

1750
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,799
they uh did a single flow cell and got

1751
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,838
400 giga sequence out of a single flow

1752
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,720
cell 180 kb and 50 reads and we gave it

1753
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:49,279
20 kb

1754
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,879
molecules so we got 30 gig of ccs data

1755
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,800
this is about 30 x coverage across the

1756
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,599
genome

1757
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,519
now what's different about this now that

1758
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,880
you have really accurate reads

1759
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:00,480
you can play some games you don't have

1760
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,000
to do an n squared assembly where you

1761
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,599
map every single read against every

1762
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,318
other read you can do something that's

1763
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,240
known as

1764
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,480
a paired shimmering approach which i'll

1765
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,919
leave you to go to jason chin's

1766
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,838
work on the paraben assemblies to how

1767
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,240
this thing works but because this

1768
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:16,000
algorithm scales not n squared but n

1769
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,679
times the coverage squared

1770
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,440
you can actually pull this off in a home

1771
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:20,239
computer so i was able to assemble this

1772
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,318
genome

1773
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,838
on my home computer in seven hours i've

1774
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:27,199
never been able to assemble

1775
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:29,039
a cannabis genome on a home computer

1776
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,480
he pulled it off in much in much less

1777
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,199
time he's got a better computer than i

1778
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,240
do

1779
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:37,118
um here's here's an example

1780
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:37,519
30 gig going in um this is hi-fi data

1781
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,280
again

1782
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,719
this is the most recent pac bio data

1783
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,839
offer sql 2.

1784
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:46,318
he assembles this in uh in 71 minutes

1785
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,599
ends up with a record-breaking uh four

1786
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,079
megabase and

1787
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,200
n50 it's the best one we've ever seen to

1788
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,359
date

1789
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:55,199
um and he tunes it a little bit further

1790
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:57,440
and pushes it out to eight megabase with

1791
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:00,078
busco scores over 97 percent

1792
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,920
71 minute assembly all right this is a

1793
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,000
remarkable time to assemble

1794
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,559
normally these things take a week or two

1795
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,119
on a 500 cpu cluster with a terabase of

1796
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,040
ram

1797
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,720
all right this is a hundred to a

1798
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,159
thousand fold faster

1799
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:13,838
than what we're doing right now and from

1800
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:15,199
a cpu standpoint

1801
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,039
i think it's actually a thousand times

1802
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:20,078
faster from a cpu standpoint because the

1803
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,358
the um the high canoe assembly took four

1804
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,280
thousand cpu hours

1805
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:24,880
and this one was i'm sorry it's a

1806
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,440
hundred fold it's 100 faster but it

1807
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,039
being 100

1808
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,039
faster means we can actually de novo

1809
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:32,000
assemble these genomes

1810
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,000
faster than we can map 200 million reads

1811
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,679
to them this so this changes the way

1812
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,480
you think about genomics if the if the

1813
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:40,399
assembly of a cannabis genome is now

1814
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,880
computationally more effective with pac

1815
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,680
bio then mapping 200 million short reads

1816
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,519
to the genome

1817
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:46,960
you start to switch plants you scent you

1818
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,000
basically do de novo assembly in your

1819
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,119
parents so you don't have to worry about

1820
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,480
structural variants you can get all

1821
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,400
those nailed and then you can aluminum

1822
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,400
map to your references you make your own

1823
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,440
personal references for your parents

1824
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,280
we can help you do that um and that way

1825
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,039
um you're not playing a guessing game

1826
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,079
with what genes are there and what genes

1827
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:03,279
aren't there

1828
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,280
okay well the other thing that popped

1829
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,559
out of this was the cbd and thc in one

1830
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,200
conjugate that's never happened before

1831
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,200
that's kind of cool

1832
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,919
um you can see them scat this is the dot

1833
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,199
plot so this is the repeat pattern

1834
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,798
that's around these genes and it's

1835
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,239
absolutely remarkable it's like this

1836
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:21,358
crazy fractal

1837
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,679
um that you see and um in fact

1838
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,880
here's another view of it oh uh here's

1839
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,358
another view of it you've got

1840
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,119
all of this different uh repetitive

1841
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:29,598
material right as you come through this

1842
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,039
um

1843
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,200
region there's five copies and one

1844
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,599
contig and four in the other

1845
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:37,039
um so totally phased across many many

1846
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,640
megabases we've got them

1847
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,318
both uh together now we know their

1848
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,679
distance um

1849
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:43,920
that's pretty cool that's never happened

1850
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:47,279
before um

1851
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,000
now that being said like i mentioned

1852
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,640
before

1853
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
um you probably don't know who these

1854
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,920
artists are if you're not of a certain

1855
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,519
age but this here is millie vanilli uh

1856
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,880
who are busted for lip syncing and

1857
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,559
that's kind of what read mapping

1858
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,400
is and we've tolerated it in genomics

1859
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,839
because it was so affordable and cheap

1860
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,240
but now the price of long reads are

1861
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:06,078
coming down and you can get large reads

1862
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:07,519
you really should just move on and do de

1863
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,519
novo when you can

1864
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:10,960
at least on your parents all right so

1865
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:12,480
i'm gonna be like this guy who

1866
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,240
from the looks of his eyes is probably

1867
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,639
into cannabis um

1868
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,679
but this is the math here on the

1869
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,558
assembly time

1870
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:22,399
uh since you have 20 kb reads you only

1871
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,240
need 1.5 million of them

1872
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,599
and since you have more accurate data

1873
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:27,759
you really only need like 50 next

1874
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,119
coverage but we did 30.

1875
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,400
um this ends up being a

1876
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,838
much much smaller number uh than taking

1877
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,440
200 million reads

1878
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:38,558
uh and having to deal with 60-ish

1879
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,679
coverage any more coverage for the

1880
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,680
shorter reads

1881
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,318
uh you end up having to deal with a lot

1882
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,318
more computation this way so

1883
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,000
fewer reads to map and the fact that

1884
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:49,679
we're not doing an n squared algorithm

1885
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,519
here if this were n squared it'd be it'd

1886
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:52,798
be 200 million times 200 million that's

1887
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:55,519
a lot of computation

1888
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:56,719
or 1.5 million times 1.5 million still a

1889
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:57,838
lot of computation

1890
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:59,118
it's really only the square of the

1891
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:00,880
coverage that we're dealing with which

1892
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,720
is a much much smaller number

1893
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,000
when you use this peregrine approach

1894
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,798
it's still early with peregrine

1895
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,239
and we're testing it out the other thing

1896
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,759
one of the other assemblers that sergey

1897
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:13,118
korn updated was called

1898
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,799
high canoe high canoe is uh

1899
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,720
one of the more popular assemblers now

1900
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:19,358
and the remarkable thing about haikai

1901
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:22,798
canoe is it pumped out a 5.2 megabase

1902
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:24,318
assembly in this assemblathon and a 97.4

1903
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:25,920
percent busca score which is

1904
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:27,358
remarkable but the thing that gives us

1905
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,519
the most faith that this is probably the

1906
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:31,039
best genome ever assembled for cannabis

1907
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:32,880
is that the telomeres are perfectly

1908
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,719
resolved telomeres are the end of

1909
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,440
chromosomes that have like the same

1910
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,279
sequence for very long stretches in fact

1911
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,079
you can see this repeating pattern down

1912
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,680
here

1913
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:46,880
and it goes on for one half kb here 3 kb

1914
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:49,598
4 kb 5 kb 7 kb

1915
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,039
and it doesn't end it ramps all the way

1916
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,920
out to 26 kb

1917
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,119
43 kv i mean i've never seen a 43 kb

1918
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,880
repeat before in my life because

1919
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,160
sequencers just couldn't read them it's

1920
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,838
really remarkable

1921
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:02,078
and the fact that we have 17 of these

1922
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:03,199
now means that in the first attempt the

1923
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,640
genome

1924
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:06,480
sent out a pro we should have gotten

1925
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,598
about 20 chromosome telomeres

1926
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,960
the fact that three of them are

1927
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,559
collapsed is going to be probably pretty

1928
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,920
easy for us to resolve what you'll see

1929
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,079
is there are subtle differences

1930
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,039
in these telomeres and what they link to

1931
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,880
is different

1932
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:18,239
so you can get a 20kb read coming in

1933
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,000
here

1934
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,279
that bridges out here and has one or two

1935
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,880
snips in the telomere and you can link

1936
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,319
another high quality read to it and

1937
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,640
extend it and this is how we're getting

1938
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:28,400
out to some of these 43kb telomeres

1939
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:29,358
um now why am i so excited about

1940
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,798
telomeres there's not a lot of

1941
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:32,480
biological information in there i mean

1942
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,000
the molecular clock is probably in there

1943
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,240
your clones are probably getting shorter

1944
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,318
and shorter telomeres as you age

1945
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:39,838
but the reason why we're so excited

1946
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:40,159
about seeing telomeres is that when you

1947
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:42,880
get

1948
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:45,358
perfect telomere assemblies it's usually

1949
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,079
a sign that the repeats internal to your

1950
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,039
genome

1951
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,240
are all resolved perfectly as well

1952
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:51,920
because they're more divergent than

1953
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,838
telomeres telomeres are a simple

1954
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,200
sequence repeat that goes on for a long

1955
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:55,679
period of time they're very difficult to

1956
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,598
start

1957
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,199
they usually are assembly knots in fact

1958
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,400
when we look at a lot of the genomes in

1959
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,480
ncbi right now they're

1960
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,000
they don't have telomeres you do see

1961
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,280
some internal telomeric sequences

1962
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,639
which makes you think some of the some

1963
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,400
of the chromosomes might actually be

1964
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:09,920
inappropriately fused together

1965
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,079
so you get a telomere sequence in the

1966
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,440
middle you can find that that's also

1967
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,318
naturally found in plants so you don't

1968
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,599
really know what to do with that

1969
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:17,358
information but

1970
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,640
uh when you have assemblies that pop out

1971
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:20,000
beautiful telomeres like this you have

1972
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:23,358
much more confidence the rest of the

1973
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,798
genome has its repeats in order as well

1974
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:26,159
all right now what do you do with all

1975
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:27,679
this information well what we've been

1976
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:28,480
doing with this information is designing

1977
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,598
really good

1978
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,199
qpcrs to pick up yeast and mold and many

1979
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,720
people skip this step they don't bother

1980
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:35,919
sequencing the host genome and this is

1981
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:37,598
the pain they have

1982
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,039
here's a group that made a microarray

1983
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,240
system where they put all these primers

1984
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:41,519
in the microarray and everything in

1985
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:43,519
yellow hits cannabis

1986
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:45,280
so they didn't bother they didn't bother

1987
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,639
to scan cannabis references as to

1988
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,200
whether or not the primers

1989
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:50,480
were going to hybridize to it imager

1990
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,039
calibration

1991
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,400
negative control hits it all right

1992
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,318
aspergillus flavius

1993
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,480
niger these things have some homology

1994
00:59:56,318 --> 00:59:58,880
now it's not the whole pro but it's long

1995
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,119
enough

1996
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,318
of a sequence of the probe to probably

1997
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,720
interfere a little bit

1998
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:06,639
some other pcr primers that amplify the

1999
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:09,679
material have these problems too

2000
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:11,759
they filed six patents in 2018 on this

2001
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:13,039
they since told us that they no longer

2002
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,640
use these primers so

2003
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:16,079
they spent more money on attorneys

2004
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:18,879
making bogus patents than they could

2005
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,000
have spent on sequencing the genome

2006
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,798
likewise you can look at another set of

2007
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,159
primers that came out of

2008
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:30,000
a group in europe and this group is

2009
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:31,118
pivoting also into the space in the food

2010
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,639
industry where they've never had to

2011
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,240
worry about a cannabis background and

2012
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,679
are just kind of arrogantly plowing in

2013
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:36,879
assuming they don't have problems and lo

2014
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:38,239
and behold you sequence some of the

2015
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,519
amplicons that come off of their total

2016
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,239
yeast and mold primers

2017
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:44,000
and what do you hit you hit cannabis 28

2018
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:44,558
is ribosomal dna well that's not going

2019
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,559
to work

2020
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,640
that means there are cannabis plants out

2021
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,680
there that your primers amplify and

2022
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,078
you're always going to be failing

2023
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:54,159
someone for some level of yeast and mold

2024
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,240
these are also polymorphic so they may

2025
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:57,838
get amplification on some

2026
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,199
cannabis and not other strains so you

2027
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:00,078
might get some strains that just look

2028
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:01,679
like

2029
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:03,039
it works on and you get you always get

2030
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:04,480
mold on and other ones you don't and you

2031
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,000
blame it on the plant as always having

2032
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,240
mold and really you just have some snips

2033
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,358
in your in your 28s and 26s

2034
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:12,479
ribosomal regions and it appears as if

2035
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:13,039
the plant always has mold when it

2036
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,159
doesn't

2037
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,159
the other thing you shouldn't hit with

2038
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:19,118
yeast and mold primers are insects this

2039
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:21,279
insect in particular is a spider mite

2040
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,640
so if your primers had spider mites

2041
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,000
you're going to fail a lot of stuff that

2042
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:25,679
doesn't have mold that you think has

2043
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,039
mold because it's hitting spider mites

2044
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:28,399
spider mites are gross i don't want my

2045
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:29,920
canvas either but your test should be

2046
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,480
accurate it shouldn't hit stuff if it

2047
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,880
hits

2048
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,920
insects god knows what else it hits

2049
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,760
right it's going to fail

2050
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,760
for a lot other material that's not on

2051
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,040
the fail list

2052
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,440
now with this we can also go through

2053
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:42,318
canopedia i already have some videos on

2054
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,599
canopedia

2055
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:45,039
so i'm going to plow through this

2056
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,760
because you can review some of the

2057
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:48,719
canopy

2058
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,680
information in the kanapedia tutorial

2059
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:52,719
but i do want to

2060
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:54,558
point out this promiscuous dna or

2061
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:56,480
or thc synthase thing that's going on

2062
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:01,119
here here's a type four plant

2063
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:04,240
um thc cbd knockout still has thc

2064
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,599
still has thca still has cannabi

2065
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:06,959
chromine

2066
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,240
we don't have the sequence of this plant

2067
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,639
but i wouldn't be surprised if this has

2068
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:10,959
a

2069
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,960
chromium cluster and might be leaking it

2070
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,798
doesn't have a cbd gene so this thc is

2071
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,318
not coming from cbd synthase

2072
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:21,119
none detected all right so that's why

2073
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:23,920
you want to be paying attention to what

2074
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,920
types of genes you have in your genome

2075
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,358
and also read this paper zerbel's great

2076
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,639
paper where they clone these genes and

2077
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:30,159
they demonstrate they can make different

2078
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:31,440
cannabinoids under different conditions

2079
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:32,798
and they actually chart out all the

2080
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,480
different point mutations in the gene

2081
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:35,920
that starts to change these ratios

2082
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,400
we track those in those types of

2083
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,838
variants in in canopy

2084
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,680
and this is what you want to look for

2085
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:42,318
this is a variation map across thc

2086
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:45,038
synthase

2087
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:46,639
and here's one across cbd synthase um

2088
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,400
never mind this this is an

2089
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:50,239
error that the thing burped up in

2090
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,280
annotation it doesn't actually have x

2091
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:54,959
introns and cbd synthase but

2092
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,798
nevertheless these are all the different

2093
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,559
snips that we found and those snips you

2094
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:00,079
want to do is correlate them with the

2095
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,160
ones that they found as causing

2096
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,480
a decrease in function and that may help

2097
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:07,118
your breeding program

2098
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,079
now our current strain seek panel does

2099
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,798
in fact hit

2100
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,280
cbd synthase i'm sorry cbc synthase it

2101
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:17,119
also hits

2102
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:18,880
cbd and thc synthase this is 323

2103
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,318
different strains examples

2104
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,240
this is the sequencing coverage across

2105
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:23,519
them you can see a crater is down here

2106
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:24,798
on the samples that are cannabic

2107
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:26,239
chromium negative and if you pull some

2108
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:27,759
of these out of canopedia you'll see

2109
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:29,118
they don't make any cannabi chromium

2110
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,240
down here they're cannabinoid chromium

2111
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,920
negative plants

2112
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,838
um that's a good sign that means that

2113
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,599
cbd synthase which it is making isn't

2114
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:37,199
making off target can have a chromium

2115
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,798
not that it would matter but um you know

2116
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:40,399
it's just nice to know that that

2117
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,000
there's some specificity there in one

2118
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,920
direction um

2119
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,880
anyway we use this to track uh people so

2120
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,318
you don't have to sequence an entire

2121
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,519
genome to get to this answer we can help

2122
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:49,199
you breed the cannabinoids with

2123
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:50,798
just a panel um it's a little bit

2124
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:52,399
cheaper that way but um

2125
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:54,000
contact us if you're interested in there

2126
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,599
if you do get your data sequence with us

2127
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,440
there's a wealth of data you can compare

2128
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,880
to we have four terabases of sequence in

2129
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,318
a public genome browser that you can

2130
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,480
load your data in and view it and

2131
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:04,079
annotate it privately

2132
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,719
against the backdrop of all that public

2133
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,000
data and it's great information like

2134
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,879
this in here this is actually

2135
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,639
what you're looking at are the different

2136
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,079
exons that you're seeing there in pink

2137
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:15,598
with the lines connecting them and so

2138
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,519
you can actually look at alternative

2139
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,798
splice signals that you have

2140
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,719
they're not really any present here

2141
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:22,960
maybe that one um but

2142
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:24,159
uh you can see the different rna that's

2143
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,960
getting expressed in different regions

2144
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,118
of the genome

2145
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,960
and uh gives you information on on how

2146
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,880
much you actually have per tissue which

2147
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,880
is kind of informative

2148
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,200
and you can make other um tools we do

2149
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,640
have a 16 snip panel

2150
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:37,679
that you can use to do seed to cell

2151
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,480
tracking with it gives you enough

2152
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,279
certificate enough

2153
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,199
enough information um that you can pin

2154
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,359
down a strain in a gross ballpark and

2155
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:46,318
this actually feeds right into canopedia

2156
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:48,239
because we have

2157
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:49,920
6 500 snips in there across all the

2158
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:50,719
strains that we aggressively monitor and

2159
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,880
these 16

2160
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,399
key into that so that we can plug into

2161
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,400
canopedia from here

2162
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,240
and we can also read the btbd allele and

2163
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,240
the xy marker off that assay

2164
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:01,199
we're building virus assays we're

2165
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:02,959
playing around with some other

2166
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,558
expression assays as well

2167
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,039
but all of this is predicated on having

2168
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,920
a really good reference

2169
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,400
on top to top that off uh we do have

2170
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,798
five

2171
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,318
color aspergillus assays now so nigeria

2172
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:15,679
terious flavors and fumigatus are all

2173
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:17,358
done in different wavelengths in one

2174
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,759
single tube with a fifth

2175
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:21,440
color for the cannabis control there's

2176
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,319
more enzyme the kids are more sensitive

2177
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,400
than before

2178
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:26,400
and we have them worked working out um

2179
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,838
with uh some of these can work out with

2180
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,358
a live debt essay you just have to be

2181
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:31,279
careful what channel you put the control

2182
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,358
for the live debt assay in

2183
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,039
but anyway this is uh this is a new kit

2184
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:36,719
that's out that greatly simplifies

2185
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,000
aspergillus testing in the field and we

2186
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:39,598
know our primers don't have

2187
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,599
hit all these other extraneous places in

2188
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,200
the genome because we've got more genome

2189
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:44,960
sequence than anybody else we know how

2190
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:46,399
to make primers as a result of that

2191
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,079
and that means you can make primers that

2192
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,760
do this this is a beautiful site to see

2193
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,960
you take your primers apply them against

2194
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,240
all these different organisms and

2195
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,199
demonstrate that they do not hit off

2196
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:55,679
target

2197
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,960
that is really key so our aspergillus

2198
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:58,480
all four of our assays have been

2199
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,920
screened against all of these organisms

2200
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,318
this is part of an aoec

2201
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,480
inclusion and exclusion criteria and

2202
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:05,440
we're in an aoec process of validating

2203
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,039
this now

2204
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,519
all these people help pull this off

2205
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,880
takes a village um it is really an honor

2206
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:13,440
to work with a lot of them

2207
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,480
um they have been they've been just

2208
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,400
tremendous aids and

2209
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,240
and uh get it it's just diverse it's

2210
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,119
diversity in terms of the the expertise

2211
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,439
you have here

2212
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,880
experts in gpus with people who know

2213
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,480
about methylation enzymes and single

2214
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,079
molecule sequencing and even some block

2215
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,079
chains that really leads to a

2216
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,599
kind of a fun day at work every day so

2217
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,798
um and then these people

2218
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,720
directly have been contributing to

2219
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:34,318
various aspects of the project um

2220
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:35,919
a lot of folks here missile genomics

2221
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:36,880
have put in long hours making all this

2222
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,639
stuff work

2223
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,160
uh with that crazy grant structure we

2224
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:41,838
had and um

2225
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:43,358
and dash has been uh you know a great

2226
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,279
partner in funding all this

2227
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:46,798
uh and then all these folks as well who

2228
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,119
have chipped in over the years so

2229
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:51,119
thank you and hopefully that is within

2230
01:06:58,838 --> 01:07:01,838
time
