00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,000
this industry for about 10 years my wife

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,599
and i cringed i'm not gonna get

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,600
emotional now uh started this uh

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,320
started this journey in 2010 cannabis

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,039
wasn't our lifestyle and i'll just do a

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,079
cliff note version my father-in-law was

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,079
diagnosed with stage four uh lung to

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,520
brain cancer and he was on 24 7 oxygen

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
and he was

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,039
declining every day so every morning we

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,160
would call to make sure did he make it

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,480
through the night and i said i'd like to

25
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,640
go to your next oncologist appointment

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,878
and we went and karen and i found a

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,280
study that showed 20 excuse me 40 of

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
cancer patients pass some malnutrition

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,799
before cancer takes over so while we're

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,680
in the oncologist's office we asked how

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,960
much time do we have and his oncologist

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,439
said

33
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,679
two weeks and through tears

34
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,199
uh more from me my father passed about a

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
year and a half prior not from cancer

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,000
but from a heart attack

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,640
her grandparents were still alive 98 97

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,879
they they were together since age 16 so

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,879
if that's not a beautiful way to live

40
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,640
and i said what about cannabis for

41
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,039
appetite stimulation not knowing the

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,079
true medical benefits of this incredible

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
plant

44
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,319
and i call it corinne mary poppins

45
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,118
because she didn't drink and she didn't

46
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,639
smoke and i said dean kerr the caregiver

47
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,040
and we did and we went on this journey

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,759
the blind leading the blind and back

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,600
then in 2010 2011

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,680
there was no guidance there wasn't uh

51
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,359
top doctors in this industry scientists

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,118
that were really out there talking about

53
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,879
the benefits of cannabis

54
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,799
dosing dosing there was nothing about

55
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,560
dosing you would say

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,200
enough for one person but it was really

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,199
enough to feed the whole nfl football

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,919
team with what the what the the dosings

59
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,318
were

60
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,000
so we found a coconut game a piece of

61
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,479
chocolate knocked him on his behind and

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,759
we found a coconut and capsule that the

63
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,759
reason we went that way allowed us to

64
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,318
freeze and cut into slivers

65
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,479
and within 24 hours he was eating

66
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,878
and

67
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,959
six months later hospice fires him as a

68
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,479
patient at nine months he was never

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,400
going to get scanned and he came back

70
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:39,919
with no evidence of recurrent disease

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,560
we said wow this is a miraculous plan so

72
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,958
we went on this journey to educate

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,519
education is the key

74
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,598
uh not only in life but especially with

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
this this uh

76
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,598
plant

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
as the laws in the united states are

78
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,399
growing

79
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,439
for cannabis use

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,200
the lack of doctors knowledge is is far

81
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,759
far behind

82
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,079
and so it's tough when a patient calls

83
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,239
hey my doctor just recommended cannabis

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,920
what do i do now

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,920
and that's frustrating and so

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,879
conferences like this conferences i look

87
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,719
at it as the ripple effect

88
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,560
pebble in the pond ripple effect the

89
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,560
education that's going on so what we've

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,158
learned here this week we'll take back

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,000
to our home and share with our doctors

92
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,000
our families our patients etc

93
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,719
2017 my wife was diagnosed with

94
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,359
pancreatic cancer and she passed four

95
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,359
months later

96
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,199
to me

97
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,720
success with this plan is saving a life

98
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,359
like we hit a grand slam with my

99
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,318
father-in-law

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,920
other success is getting out of bed

101
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:56,560
seeing your loved one sleep

102
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,798
pain relief wellness

103
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,799
and so

104
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,518
i continue this journey this is real

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
life for me and i know it's real life

106
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
for a lot of people who've been into

107
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
this injury and who

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,120
changed their whole careers eloise

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,199
eloise has worked with us for years she

110
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,000
was an oncology nurse

111
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,079
to see all these patients passing away

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,478
from chemo radiation

113
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,079
it was affecting her health

114
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,758
affecting her health and she saw the

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,040
benefits of this plan she changed her

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
whole career

117
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,319
bonnie goldstein the same thing

118
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,639
ucla studied

119
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,478
medical doctor saw the benefits really

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,319
stuck took a step forward

121
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,399
i mean all uh

122
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,759

uh

125
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,879
putting their reputations on the line

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,759
and and it's nice to see that their

127
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,319
stigma of this plant has really dropped

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,600
because before it was

129
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,040
hush we're not really going to talk

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,879
happy to and for the amazing av crew in

171
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,639
the back if there's any way to get more

172
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,360
monitor on the stage so we could hear

173
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,560
john more clearly that would be great

174
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
so

175
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,519
um

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,400
probably about seven years ago i was

177
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,120
wondering how to help my patients detect

178
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,879
a

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,280
kind of subtle change in the way that

180
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,120
they're feeling based on a certain dose

181
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,159
of cannabis because i became very

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,959
interested

183
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,759
in using the lowest effective dose to

184
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,359
nudge the physiology using a term from

185
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,199
kevin uh

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,360
so that we don't overwhelm one's

187
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,520
physiology we can work in concert with

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,680
the endocannabinoid system instead of

189
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,079
undermining it and i developed something

190
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,918
called the inner inventory which is nice

191
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,839
it feels good and it just takes about 30

192
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,000
seconds so we could all do it together

193
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,839
right now and the way i recommend my

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,399
patients do this is to practice the

195
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,918
inner inventory maybe write it down in

196
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,239
fact our healer products come with

197
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,079
little workbooks and worksheets so you

198
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,759
can keep track of how you're feeling

199
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,719
with certain doses of cannabis and

200
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,319
really get a highly individualized

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
treatment regimen

202
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
so there's three measures could be four

203
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,439
if there's a symptom that you're

204
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,680
experiencing and you want to check in

205
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,279
with that the first one is breath and so

206
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,240
you're going to write on a scale from 1

207
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,079
to 10 how smooth and easy your breath is

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,960
when you just take one nice deep

209
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,959
inhalation and exhalation

210
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,918
and so you could just think about what

211
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,038
that number is for you for me it's nine

212
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,079
right now

213
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,399
and the next measure is body so

214
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,399
uh just wherever whatever position

215
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,159
you're in just kind of remains still

216
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,439
there and right on a scale from one to

217
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,439
ten how comfortable that is

218
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,240
and i'm at about a six

219
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,639
and then the next one is mood so you

220
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,120
could rate how content you feel at this

221
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,519
moment or you could put a fake smile on

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,280
your face and give it a few seconds and

223
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,279
see how real the fake smile becomes

224
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,639
and i'm i'm like 9.5

225
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,879
um and then you could rate a symptom so

226
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,200
say you were gonna inhale some cannabis

227
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,879
you would maybe recheck that in 15 or 20

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440
minutes or if you were taking some oral

229
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,759
oral mucosal cannabis recheck that in

230
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,600
about 90 minutes and see if that dose

231
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,958
affected you now other things might have

232
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,278
happened in that time that could have

233
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,439
changed your inner inventory score and

234
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,200
the the secret is that

235
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,440
just checking in with yourself is

236
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,360
probably going to make you feel better

237
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,600
but that's a good thing to do anyways

238
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,000
you know if we can kind of capitalize on

239
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,839
this placebo acceptance effect and make

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,278
ourselves feel better just by paying

241
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,560
attention to ourselves maybe given a

242
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,039
little self-love

243
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,679
that's that's just helpful so there we

244
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,120

245
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,639

saying i didn't catch that it's

enough can you turn this on this this i

251
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,519
think it's the side one pointing at us

252
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,519
might be helpful but

253
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
anyway i wanted you guys to introduce

254
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,839

therapeutic agents but phyto as in plant

273
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,560
or in the states we say a clinical uh

274

herbalist

[Laughter]

278
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,519
so

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,559
you know i always say cannabis is not a

280
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,519
one size fits all type of medicine age

281
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,879
weight current health condition

282
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,159
sensitivities stage and drug to drug

283
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,159
interactions and so

284
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,920
i wasn't getting into drug drug drug

285
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,519
interactions but let's talk about this

286
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,599
one comes up too and bonnie you talk

287
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,360
spoke about this earlier

288
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,278
is

289
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,399
i want the re i want the medical portion

290
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,600
of the plant

291
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,200
not

292
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,440
the recreational portion of the plant

293
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,600
and we spoke about thc there's a lot of

294
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
benefits of t of all the cannabinoids

295
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,959
you know when i usually present i

296
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,799
usually have a wall with a roll of duct

297
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,799
tape up there and people look at me like

298
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,719
hey dummy you have the wrong the wrong

299
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,479
slide up there and i kind of laugh

300
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,560
because when people ask what about this

301
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,000
what about this what about this ailment

302
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,759
i don't want to say it's like a million

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,159
and one uses like duct tape but when you

304
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,559
really get down to it really is

305
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,000
and uh

306
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,119
there's so many

307
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,399
each cannabinoid plays a role

308
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,839
thc

309
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,278
we're here in california my brother's in

310
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,120
the wine business i'm in santa barbara

311
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,360
it's like you know we can have a sip of

312
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,959
wine chip wines of wine and wine tasting

313
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,720
and the same thing with thc and you've

314
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,518
always shared that less is more so can

315
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,920
you talk about the less is more and not

316
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,839
only beneficial because it's not covered

317
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,479
by insurance yet but also saving money

318
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,000
but also you might find your sweet spot

319
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
at the lower amount

320
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,759
um would you like to talk on that and

321
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,278
that and the same thing down there with

322
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,439
you kevin please

323
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,159
sure i'll just jump in real quick bonnie

324
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,959
showed nice slides earlier that

325
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:06,240
depicted the internalization of the cb1

326
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:08,239
receptor when it's over stimulated now

327
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,320
we have heard over and over again how

328
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,360
important this endocannabinoid system is

329
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,040
in responding to illness and injury in

330
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,000
supporting our growth and development

331
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,480
our neuroplasticity we want that system

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,039
working as efficiently as possible and

333
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,759
when we build tolerance to thc at least

334
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,559
to some extent we are decreasing the

335
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,559
capacity of that system to to keep us

336
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,078
healthy so um

337
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,719
you know one of the nice things is that

338
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,638
it's easy to reverse tolerance to thc it

339
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,040
happens probably more quickly than a lot

340
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,879
of other agents but

341
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,078
so it's not like a lot of harm done and

342
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:47,039
maybe even a useful lesson learned from

343
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,958
overusing thc and building tolerance to

344
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,120
it but what i see with my patients is

345
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,039
when each person has

346
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,679
kind of figured out their optimal dose

347
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,838
of cannabis the retention of efficacy

348
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,519
could be decades i mean they really

349
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,440
don't

350
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,839
lose the beneficial effects and over

351
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,959
time they tend to use less and less

352
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,639
cannabis the dose goes down low slightly

353
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,518
we saw that in ethan's slide this

354
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,000
morning and i think that's because we're

355
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,240
becoming more balanced inside we're

356
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,958
establishing a greater homeostatic

357
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,039
capacity and and people are healing when

358
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,199
we're less sick we tend to need less

359
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,360
cannabis so that's my perspective on

360
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,680
always using the lowest effective dose

361
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
and just to comment uh yeah that this

362
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,559
whole you know i think it came from cnn

363
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,039
this

364
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,159
like a lot of other things this whole

365
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:38,480
concept that cbd is medical and thc is

366
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,799
recreational it's just it's crazy and i

367
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,720
think you all know that but for anyone

368
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,719
in the audience that hasn't realized

369
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,519
that yet after listening to all these

370
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,920
panelists today thc is an incredibly

371
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,440
powerful therapeutic agent and quite

372
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,599
versatile it does not need to be

373
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,680
psychoactive there's almost always in

374
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,600
every patient a therapeutic window where

375
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,838
there's a certain dose of thc that will

376
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,839
create beneficial therapeutic effects

377
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,160
and then a higher dose that'll start to

378
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,720
create potentially adverse effects which

379
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,719
might be impairment or or unwanted

380
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
psychoactivity

381
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,839
thank you yeah and i'll take it from the

382
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,600
30 000 volt view since uh dr sulak just

383
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,160
did such a good job of explaining on the

384
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,800
cannabis level so there's a concept that

385
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,639
goes across all biological kingdoms and

386
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,799
it's called hormeses

387
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,000
it's had several names over the last

388
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,078
decade

389
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,320
today we know it mostly as biphasic

390
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,120
response and essentially what that means

391
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,600
is that a low dose can be incredibly

392
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,919
beneficial and a high dose can actually

393
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,240
even be toxic if not damaging right so

394
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,319
the concept there is that finding the

395
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,278
right dose is really key so dose

396
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,440
titration or slowly scaling up your dose

397
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,360
to that optimal level is something that

398
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,560
i used to do with other plants besides

399
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,639
cannabis

400
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,039
in the clinic i mean i think it's really

401
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,278
really key to recognize this

402
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,639
interestingly a quick story on this is

403
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,480
that

404
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,360
in the 19 so the homeopaths back in the

405
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,600
early to mid 20th century were looking

406
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,000
for a way to explain their medicine

407
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,839
scientifically and of course if you

408
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,958
understand homeopathy truly understand

409
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,639
homeopathy um there's it's we're going

410
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,319
to have to change the laws of phases

411
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,560
physics and chemistry to

412
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,240
really be able to embrace homeopathy in

413
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,319
a scientific way not that it doesn't

414
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,919
work i've seen it work and i've seen it

415
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,160
work in in laboratory situations as well

416
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,719
but they needed a way to explain it and

417
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,879
so the hormesis concept was really big

418
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,639
in the early to early 20th century in

419
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,679
fact there were multiple journals

420
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,839
dedicated to just that concept that low

421
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,679
dose could be very beneficial and high

422
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,639
dose and you know they were talking

423
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,159
about toxins for example

424
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,360
the guy that

425
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,559
has brought it into modern age

426
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,680
found by

427
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,518
trying to poison a plant that he

428
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,078
actually made it grow more because he

429
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,440
deluded the poison too much

430
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,120
and i'm not saying go out and drink

431
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,360
poison give me give me clear here that's

432
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,639
not what i'm saying here but that

433
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,480
concept of one dose having one effect

434
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,039
and another dose having another effect

435
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,639
that biphasic response so the homeopaths

436
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,120
jumped on this model they were like

437
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,320
that's how our stuff works really low

438
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,959
doses of whatever it was whatever the

439
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,959
homeopathic remedy was akin item or

440
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,399
arsenic or you know that's that's how

441
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,758
our stuff works

442
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,958
well

443
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,919
interestingly

444
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,799
in a very political move in the sciences

445
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:39,679
which we're supposed to be immune to

446
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,120
the concept of hormesis dropped

447
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,479
off the map

448
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,799
and

449
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,039
calabrese edward calabrese brought it

450
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:51,919
back in about 1980 and so now there's

451
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,599
hundreds of publications on hormises so

452
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,599
interesting story there the homeopaths

453
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,519
kind of

454
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,278
we lost the concept because the horm

455
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,799
because of the homeopaths and i just

456
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,799
want to add one other thing about the

457
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,038
homeopaths that a lot of you might not

458
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,359
realize but this whole breaking cannabis

459
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,359
down into two things cannabis indica and

460
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,359
cannabis sativa this was an early

461
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,599
homeopathic concept they had two

462
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,918
different cannabis remedies that had

463
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,159
some overlapping but distinct features

464
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,439
and again these were just incredibly

465
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,600
small quantities of cannabis like to

466
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,798
some extent diluted beyond avogadro's

467
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,279
number where you're just getting an

468
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:30,400
energetic essence of cannabis and no

469
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:33,440
actual molecular content potentially at

470
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,280
least and um and that there were these

471
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,360
differences among this plant and so

472
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,678
thanks to the homeopaths for the whole

473
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,678
indica sativa nomenclature nightmare

474
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,918
and by the way that's a that's a really

475
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,640
important point is people say homeopathy

476
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,240
when they really mean herbal medicine

477
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,880
and they're not the same

478
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,079
right what dr sulak was just talking

479
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,880
about is

480
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,480
dilution beyond avogadro's number which

481
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,640
basically means

482
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,319
technically there's

483
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
one or two molecules in your remedy

484
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,918
depending on how diluted the remedy is

485
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,038
so

486
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,720
that's why i'm saying they'd have to

487
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,798
change the laws of chemistry or physics

488
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,360
to really be able to scientifically

489
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,879
explain homeopathy

490
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,639
thank you

491
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,559
you know the discussion of products

492
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
comes up quite a bit with patients and

493
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,720
so

494
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,880
bonnie you and louise spoke about

495
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,400
you now there's an overabundant cbd and

496
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,080
now you can't find the good products of

497
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,080
thcs thc products out there

498
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,399
can you explain

499
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,599
the difference to patients

500
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,840
of

501
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:44,399
medical products versus recreational

502
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:48,159
products okay so they all can be used

503
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,519
for either right i mean cbd dominant cbd

504
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,919
you might have to drink the whole bottle

505
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,240
to get a little buzz going but for

506
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,919
anything that has thc in it it can be

507
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,759
used recreationally and can be used

508
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,080
medically so i just had this come up

509
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,240
with a patient where a parent went in to

510
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,399
a dispensary to pick up a product and

511
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
the person behind the counter because

512
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,320
she has a letter for a child and a

513
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,079
caregiver letter for herself they knew

514
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,480
she was there picking up a product for a

515
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,720
sick child and the person behind the

516
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,880
counter said well that's not a medical

517
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,720
product that's a recreational product

518
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,919
what i i don't know really what that

519
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,798
means it's a it's a i want this these

520
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,320
compounds in this dose to try with that

521
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,240
child so

522
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,000
why are we labeling medical versus

523
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,440
recreational now certainly something

524
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,480
that's 90 thc i think we could all

525
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,640
probably

526
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,319
say that that's leaning more towards the

527
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,280
intoxication

528
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,000
goal

529
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,639
but at the same time i have some chronic

530
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,279
pain patients who adult patients who

531
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,679
suffer terribly and have used very high

532
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,399
potency just to be able to step away

533
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,400
from their pain even for an hour you

534
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,038
don't get to take your back pain off or

535
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,200
your botched back surgery and walk away

536
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,599
from it and then come back later so how

537
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,519
do you disassociate is you can

538
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,359
use this medication to step back and

539
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,359
distract yourself and maybe focus on

540
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,519
something else for a little while so i

541
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,439
don't make a distinction between medical

542
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,879
and recreational i'm i'm all about

543
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,080
what's in the product and what's the

544
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,760
dosing for that particular patient

545
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,119
yeah thank you would you like to add

546
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,919
that no

547
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,079
no i think she covered it

548
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,080
no

549
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,400
i mean i agree with bonnie there's you

550
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,240
know in california there's no real

551
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,919
distinction right they try to distinct

552
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,599
it by what license you get but the

553
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,720
products are all the same

554
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,719
and

555
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,120
you know i wish that we could see more

556
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,880
products that had more versatility

557
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,959
in the thc world we're just trying to

558
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,480
make more and more concentrated products

559
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,440
and i think

560
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,919
we're missing a large population

561
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,159
that you know i wish the industry could

562
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,840
appreciate i think um it was in um

563
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,559
now i'm forgetting her name doctor who

564
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:03,199
did the opioid um talk

565
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,200
oh

566
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,360
um you know was talking about you know

567
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,558
the the people come back when it's

568
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,839
medical when they're using it

569
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:12,960
medicinally they come back and they

570
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,599
purchase it and they purchase it

571
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,679
multiple times a day and you know that's

572
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,158
a market that we're missing here an

573
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,679
opportunity to really you know provide

574
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,159
for these patients when we're just

575
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,080
focused on cannabinoid content you know

576
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,320
i'd like to see us

577
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:31,038
provide more variety for consumers and

578
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,839
healthcare consumers and patients

579
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:33,359
yeah

580
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,038
you know bonnie you and i've had this

581
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,719
discussion over the years

582
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,519
you know with california

583
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,038
passing the 21 and over

584
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,839
and i'm seeing this in other states as

585
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,798
well

586
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:47,119
it's pushing out the the true medical

587
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,440
professionals because a lot of patients

588
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,639
now say i don't need to go to the doctor

589
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,720
i'll just go down dispensary and it's

590
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
unfortunate because i truly believe

591
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,519
especially if battling is something as

592
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,840
serious as cancer a medical professional

593
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,000
should be involved um

594
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,798
a senior citizen we're not 21 and you

595
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,038
know 19 20 21 like won't do that again

596
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,038
you know type type of thing

597
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,119
there's so many products out there

598
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,798
especially cbd product it's confusing

599
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,798
people ask me what about this i mean

600
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,720
there's a there's times that i

601
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,519
it's hard to

602
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,440
point them in the right direction

603
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,440
this topic comes up all the time and i

604
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,519
know bonnie you and i have spoken about

605
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,240
this about

606
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,759
suppositories is there any

607
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,240
bioavailability in there because that

608
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,480
comes up quite a bit years ago karen and

609
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,440
i didn't had wrote an article about

610
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,279
is the posterior superior

611
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,480
we got a lot of [ __ ] about that one

612
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,879
believe me

613
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,279
and so uh we had to take it down because

614
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,559
uh there was a lot of fighting on that

615
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,440
one and but

616
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:53,359
i don't want to take i'm not into taking

617
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,000
giving false hope but i'm into giving

618
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,918
hope and if eating this flower worked

619
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,410
with a cancer patient i'd say eat the

620
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,600
flour

621
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,120
[Music]

622
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,558
what are your thought process on

623
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,719
different products especially this

624
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,720
suppository discussion because it's

625
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,240
coming up quite a bit and some people

626
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,159
say it's working it's working

627
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,000
and i don't want to say

628
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,480
what you shared if you can add to that

629
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,679
so there's a few ways to look at this so

630
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,679
number one if we look at the

631
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,400
clinical research

632
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,720
right now there is no evidence that just

633
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,559
cannabis alone and suppository will be

634
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,960
absorbed into your

635
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,839
bloodstream at sufficient levels

636
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,038
so

637
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,199
if you have a suppository that there's a

638
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,240
study that shows that the cannabinoids

639
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
if

640
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,480
bound to a

641
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,120
compound in this particular research use

642
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,200
the drug called hemi succinate which is

643
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,839
what we call a permeate permeation

644
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,880
enhancer it helps bring it in it helps

645
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,879
cross

646
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,120
the barrier that you have to cross over

647
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,960
to get it into your bloodstream that

648
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,959
actually showed some very good success

649
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,319
but that is not what as far as i know

650
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,919
what's available on the market in

651
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,079
california

652
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,320
i have had patients who report

653
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,278
especially cancer patients back in the

654
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,359
day

655
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,599
that they reported that they were doing

656
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,918
well but remember that they weren't just

657
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,399
doing suppositories they were also on

658
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,480
chemotherapy they were also on vitamin c

659
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,919
infusion some of them were taking

660
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,360
mushrooms some of them were taking

661
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,840
vitamin c

662
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,399
and all kinds of other concoctions i

663
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,240
think it's a very nice thing that they

664
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,919
wanted to believe it was the cannabis

665
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,000
that was working but when you have so

666
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,278
many variables you cannot say what is

667
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,240
working

668
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,558
if it's not in your if you have thc in

669
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,120
your bloodstream you should have some

670
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,720
effect in your brain if it's in your

671
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,558
bloodstream at any

672
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,558
you know a significant level that we

673
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,720
would think that would be needed to help

674
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,079
kill cancer cells

675
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,400
however

676
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,918
in my experience so and

677
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,038
i always learned

678
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,640
that

679
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,319
cancer patients should not be putting

680
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,360
anything up their bum because you're at

681
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,200
lower immunity and you can introduce

682
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,439
bacteria into your bloodstream and get

683
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,600
septic and if you read about this this

684
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,600
is a real thing that you can develop

685
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,839
sepsis especially when your immune

686
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,558
system is not working well

687
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,639
in pediatrics

688
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,558
here and there when i first started in

689
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,000
this some parents were trying to put

690
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,639
tincture

691
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,640
rectally to stop a seizure because there

692
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,799
is a drug called diastat which is a

693
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,120
rectal valium which will stop a seizure

694
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,119
that's clinically proven

695
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,639
and parents would say oh the seizure

696
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,319
stopped and i said i would say well the

697
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,759
seizure's going to stop anyway at some

698
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,839
point you don't know if it's the

699
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,079
cannabis or not so we need to have a

700
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,158
clinical trial to see

701
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,000
however in general that's kind of like

702
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,440
most people don't do that anymore i

703
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,759
think they're uh

704
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,080
would rather not do that to their child

705
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,599
um but in general i am not a big fan of

706
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,678
suppositories i think it's kind of a

707
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,678
waste of money and

708
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,880
unfortunately uh there are still a lot

709
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,200
of products out there though that are

710
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,039
being used that way

711
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,120
i'd like to add a couple of things i

712
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,599
think that suppositories can be useful

713
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,359
for local problems so if somebody

714
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,278
hemorrhoids is a good example a very

715
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,079
common condition itching pain

716
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,599
inflammation thc is great for all of

717
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,798
those things

718
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:20,158
vaginal pain can respond to thc

719
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:22,158
i think that some patients do absorb thc

720
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,880
through their rectum because they feel

721
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,640
high and they feel euphoric and good and

722
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,720
whatever that patient

723
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,440
preparation combination is great that

724
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,440
works well i think where bonnie was

725
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,120
going is that we just hear about a lot

726
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,480
of people that say i need to take these

727
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:40,558
heroic doses of thc but when i do them

728
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,558
by mouth i get so high i can't take it

729
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,399
so i'm going to insert them rectally and

730
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,639
just assume that they're getting into my

731
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,798
body and i'm not getting high so it's a

732
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,120
great way for me to avoid this adverse

733
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,960
effect and there's one

734
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,959
mechanism that might explain that but it

735
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,840
cannot explain it fully that's that when

736
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,159
we swallow things all the blood from the

737
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,558
gut goes to the liver first and the thc

738
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,760
gets converted into an active metabolite

739
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,440
that's called 11-hydroxy thc might feel

740
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,839
a little stronger for some people but

741
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,000
really that's not a full explanation so

742
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,839
i just wanted to add that and then you

743
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,960
know when you say

744
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,639
some people said that the rectal thc was

745
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,120
helping them even though it wasn't

746
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,200
getting them high i just want to point

747
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,959
out that there is something very very

748
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,240
interesting happening in the ultra low

749
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,159
dose range of thc but there's a lot more

750
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,159
cost effective way to get that ultra low

751
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,720
dose range than putting a whole bunch of

752
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,679
it up your butt

753
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,360
and a lot less invasive intrusive right

754
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,480
yeah and one other thing there is a

755
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,959
study on cbd for um

756
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,399
in a rectal suppository for colitis

757
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,558
so and remember that's kind of like

758
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,879
local application so that's that's what

759
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,319
that looks at

760
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,919
kevin you want to add anything

761
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:59,119
[Laughter]

762
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,000
so are there any contraindications you

763
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,519
know

764
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,759
with patients that

765
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,679
you know liver schizophrenia

766
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,038
is there ever a chance ever a time where

767
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,519
you totally

768
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,519
route patients away from cannabis

769
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,839
so i had someone in my office who was

770
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,440
full-blown

771
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,359
psychotic and i

772
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,399
kind of didn't trust her judgment just

773
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,319
in general yeah and so i told her that i

774
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,398
this is many years ago i told her that i

775
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,918
could you know see her if a family

776
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:29,519
member

777
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,960
would come back with her just so i could

778
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,960
get the full picture i mean she was

779
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,360
going off on the people next door got

780
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,600
the tin foil and the you know the

781
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,278
cameras and stuff and so i just felt

782
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,439
uncomfortable because i really wasn't

783
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,200
sure what her status was and i wasn't

784
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,880
i'm not a psychiatrist so i'm not

785
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,798
qualified

786
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,240
do i think it would cannabis would have

787
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,879
helped her yes but i just felt

788
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,720
uncomfortable at that moment in time

789
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,039
i have a young man in my practice who's

790
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,200
been my patient for

791
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,278
13 out of 14 years that i've been doing

792
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
this who has schizoaffective disorder

793
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,798
and what i did with him

794
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,960
was i

795
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,960
uh in california we normally give a

796
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,399
letter for a year an approval letter i

797
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,159
gave him an approval letter for one

798
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,000
month and i made him check in every

799
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,360
single month with me so i could just see

800
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,919
his progress

801
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,359
he has so he had the typical

802
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,840
type of

803
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,759
unfortunate course with schizophrenia

804
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,319
where he would

805
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:27,359
become psychotic get hospitalized go on

806
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,278
medication do very well

807
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,798
he hated his side effects he would go

808
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,319
off medication

809
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,079
and then end up in the hospital it was

810
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,599
this vicious cycle and i'm happy to say

811
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,359
that in 13 years using predominantly thc

812
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,240
because we didn't have cbd back when he

813
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,479
was using it he has managed to not have

814
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,079
one hospitalization he has not gone off

815
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,679
his other medication

816
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:52,000
low-dose thc has helped him

817
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,080
so it can't you you can successfully

818
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,679
treat people and i would here and there

819
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,199
i would get

820
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,278
um

821
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,600
older adults come in with their

822
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,079
children who were adults and say

823
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,599
my son is smoking pot but boy it's so

824
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,599
much easier to live with him with his

825
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,439
schizophrenia he's calm he's not

826
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,158
destroying the house he takes his other

827
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,600
medication he seems to have some joy

828
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,520
because one of the biggest problems with

829
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,480
schizophrenics is they have no joy in

830
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,839
life

831
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,159
and when you hear a parent coming in and

832
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:25,359
telling you this is what's happening

833
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,360
it's very hard to

834
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,359
deny and i remember this is back when i

835
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,278
was first doing this

836
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,199
i felt very comfortable recommending

837
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,200
cannabis to those families because there

838
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,278
was a caregiver involved and they're

839
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,960
reporting to me

840
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,079
what the results are

841
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,720
and they're the ones that are living

842
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,720
with the patient

843
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,759
i don't think there's any firm

844
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:49,919
contraindications for cannabis i think

845
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,839
one area that we should be extra

846
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,960
cautious is in cancer patients that are

847
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:58,639
undergoing immunotherapy especially the

848
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,278
the um uh navalo mab drug which has been

849
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,480
published in two studies and shown so

850
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,319
this is a type of cancer treatment that

851
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,319
revs up the immune system and causes a

852
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,398
lot of inflammation in the body to help

853
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,879
the immune system fight the cancer and

854
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,398
of course with cannabis being an

855
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,960
anti-inflammatory compound we have to be

856
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,798
cautious about not dampening down the

857
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,038
effect of that drug but i wouldn't even

858
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,679
say that it's a firm contraindication

859
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,679
for example we know that corticosteroids

860
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,679
like prednisone decrease the

861
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,120
effectiveness of those treatments but

862
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,880
sometimes when people are on those

863
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,798
treatments they'll develop too much

864
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,519
inflammation they can get pneumonitis or

865
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,038
colitis or reactive skin conditions eye

866
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,200
conditions and they'll be given

867
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,519
prednisone to help settle that stuff

868
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,360
down and still remain on the treatment

869
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,240
we know there's a lower rate of efficacy

870
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,479
but

871
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,159
still they can complete the course and

872
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,679
so i think cannabis could be viewed in

873
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,679
kind of that same light it should be

874
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,000
used with a lot of caution but not a

875
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,840
firm contraindication

876
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,359
thank you

877
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:01,558
you want to add to that are you

878
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,558
you want to follow no no

879
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,558
just like it says right there right

880
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,278
so what about so eloise you work with a

881
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,678
lot of patients and what about

882
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,359
cannabis use disorder

883
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,960
that follows up on some of those contra

884
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,319
maybe contraindications with maybe a

885
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,720
patient who's schizophrenic

886
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,319
yeah i mean there's definitely diagnoses

887
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,558
i'm not comfortable working with i don't

888
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,879
feel qualified to

889
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,678
manage and a lot of them can be complex

890
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,720
mental health conditions

891
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,200
i have a patient right now who is quite

892
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,240
interesting he's got pretty significant

893
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,080
post-traumatic stress and came to me

894
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,640
already consuming 200 milligrams of thc

895
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,639
100 milligrams at a time twice a day and

896
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,120
his psychiatrist was on the call with us

897
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,440
and just said wow you know when he takes

898
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,839
these dosages our therapy sessions are

899
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,798
incredible like he's so open and i've

900
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:00,558
just seen so much great progress in him

901
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:01,918
now i'm starting to see

902
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,678
him

903
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,200
rely on the thc in a way that's making

904
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,679
me uncomfortable

905
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,440
i've increased him to 300 milligrams so

906
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,360
his doses three times a day but i do

907
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,720
think we're starting to see

908
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,439
i'm not sure if it's cannabis use

909
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,759
disorder or cp1 downregulation but i my

910
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,320
concern about cannabis use disorder from

911
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,919
the non-medical cannabis community is i

912
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,599
don't know that they're qualified to be

913
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,120
making these diagnoses when they don't

914
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,240
really understand the endocannabinoid

915
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,918
system they don't understand the

916
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,278
complexity of legalization and

917
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,080
prohibition

918
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,919
and so i think it's grossly over

919
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,480
diagnosed

920
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,440
in patients and

921
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,038
i'd like to see it you know

922
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,159
like i said there's diagnoses i'm

923
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:43,839
uncomfortable with right i'm not going

924
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,440
to diagnose somebody with post-traumatic

925
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,879
stress i'm not qualified i don't know

926
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,558
that some of these clinicians are

927
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,480
qualified to diagnose cannabis use

928
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:51,918
disorder but i think it's a conversation

929
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,759
we need to be having in the community

930
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,320
because it's very divisive

931
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,879
um and i would like us to be more open

932
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,599
about you know i see many cannabis

933
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,159
professionals try to deny that cannabis

934
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,719
use disorder exist i i think i can count

935
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,878
on like two fingers how many times i've

936
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,559
actually seen it out of you know over 7

937
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,719
000 patients but

938
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,320
um you know we do need to be aware of it

939
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,918
we do need to be thoughtful about it

940
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,838
like as dustin was saying you know i

941
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,960
don't know that there's

942
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:20,559
contraindications but we need to be so

943
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,760
thoughtful about how we approach these

944
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,918
patients

945
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,040
can i just make a comment so when we

946
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:29,918
look at studies on young adults using

947
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,918
cannabis excessively or what they call

948
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,638
chronic heavy use

949
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,039
really what it comes down to is poor

950
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,440
judgment how many people know a 15 year

951
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,079
old to have good judgment i mean

952
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,119
i just survived my son being a teenager

953
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,480
and

954
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,240
and he wasn't

955
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,599
a difficult teenager and it was still

956
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,439
very difficult so i think i would see

957
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,200
you know back again back in the early

958
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,800
days of my career

959
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:59,279
being a cannabis specialist i would get

960
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,880
19 year olds that would come in and 21

961
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,720
year olds that would come in that had

962
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,358
legitimate

963
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,279
medical conditions you know

964
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,679
you see um

965
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,920
gymnasts they in high school they beat

966
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:14,399
up their bodies how about the kids that

967
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,240
play football in high school i mean i've

968
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,920
i had a kid in my practice who's had

969
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,279
four shoulder surgeries by the time he

970
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,639
was 16.

971
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,560
well he got offered pain pills or guess

972
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,879
what his buddies gave him some cannabis

973
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:29,039
is that a cannabis use disorder now by

974
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,358
the way he takes cannabis he feels

975
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:34,400
better so what does a 15 or 16 year old

976
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:36,159
do they take more it feels good more and

977
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,440
more and more they have no judgment

978
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,358
whatsoever

979
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,720
so the idea of this cannabis use

980
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,319
disorder

981
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,279
that kind of stems from that kind of

982
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,599
chronic heavy use in certain

983
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,320
age groups really is just a lack of

984
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,119
judgment because i will share with you

985
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,280
that

986
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,160
with continuity with these patients

987
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,079
because remember before 2018 you needed

988
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,799
me to approve you to get into the

989
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,440
cannabis dispensary right so these

990
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,960
kids that i would see let's say 18 19 20

991
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,480
with legitimate

992
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,800
conditions

993
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,039
i is a very interesting phenomenon it

994
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,560
was usually male because i think women

995
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,320
are a little more risk averse and a

996
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,078
little more thoughtful at that age or

997
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,599
maybe just more mature

998
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,440
but every now and then i would see

999
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,519
somebody who would come in and they'd be

1000
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,960
23 or 24

1001
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,199
and i'd say gee you know i haven't seen

1002
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,280
you in a while it's what's going on oh

1003
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,759
you know i took a break

1004
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,680
and then you know i i stopped using

1005
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,359
cannabis for five months i realized i

1006
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,039
was overdoing it and i would put my hand

1007
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,440
across the table and say welcome to

1008
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,679
adulthood right they're being thoughtful

1009
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,800
about their use finally and some of that

1010
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:45,118
is just a just being mature and being a

1011
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,000
ability to start like listening

1012
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,680
uh to your body and instead of just kind

1013
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,838
of going along with the program so to

1014
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,679
speak i hope that makes sense

1015
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,679
i'd like to make a couple comments about

1016
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,639
that it's interesting because from time

1017
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,239
to time patients come to me most recent

1018
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,559
traveled from out of state with

1019
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,479
self-diagnosed cannabis addiction

1020
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,039
looking for my help getting off cannabis

1021
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,639
which i'm happy to help with the

1022
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,480
you know my initial response is like

1023
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,879
thank god you're addicted to cannabis

1024
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,119
right it's not cigarettes or alcohol or

1025
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,760
stimulants or opioids or a number of

1026
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,119
other uh to tobacco and a number of

1027
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,280
other substances

1028
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,200
and you know i think a kind of a

1029
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,599
progressive way of looking at addiction

1030
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,239
is that the drug isn't the problem but

1031
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,320
the drug is the solution and there's

1032
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,679
some underlying problems so we work

1033
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,440
together to figure out what is this

1034
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,279
underlying problem and how can we best

1035
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,400
address it and often it's just a

1036
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,960
different

1037
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,680
use pattern of cannabis that can address

1038
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,679
it so for this most recent patient who i

1039
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,759
mean she had a very unique response to

1040
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,519
cannabis she literally had to smoke

1041
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,800
every two hours or she would have a

1042
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,239
panic attack

1043
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,640
get up in the middle of the night to

1044
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,598
smoke and so forth but by shifting away

1045
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,440
from thc dominant uh type 2

1046
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,559
cannabis varieties with more cbd and

1047
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,880
less thc gradually reducing her dose

1048
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,639
layering in some oral dosing all the

1049
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,480
meanwhile getting to the underlying

1050
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,400
problem now she has a balanced

1051
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,559
relationship with cannabis that's no

1052
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,720
longer problematic and i think you know

1053
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,960
cannabis is just so versatile

1054
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,358
the diagnostic criteria for cannabis use

1055
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,280
disorder is almost like you know almost

1056
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:21,679
any cannabis user could fit into it it's

1057
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,560
like you go to extra trouble to get your

1058
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,159
med to get this substance like i you

1059
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,440
know yeah i have to drive to the

1060
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:31,679
dispenser but um

1061
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,480
but but really what it comes down to i

1062
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,440
think when i'm working with my patients

1063
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,679
and this is an important uh transition

1064
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,760
point for people who are healing using

1065
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,440
cannabis for healing the question is are

1066
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,440
you feeling better after you use the

1067
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,519
cannabis or are you feeling worse after

1068
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,280
and and it's interesting as people get

1069
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,358
healthier and healthier they've been

1070
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,280
using cannabis as a crutch for a long

1071
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,719
time suddenly they don't need it as a

1072
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,560
crutch anymore if they keep using it

1073
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,959
that way they're going to take some and

1074
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,320
be like wow i actually felt better but

1075
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,240
if you didn't ask them that question

1076
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,000
they might not realize it and once they

1077
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,719
hit that point that's a celebration now

1078
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,639
we can kind of shift cannabis into the

1079
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,879
form of a tonic like something that you

1080
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,960
can use to improve your resilience to

1081
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,880
stress to stay healthy to treat acute

1082
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,039
illnesses and symptoms but it doesn't

1083
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,079
have to be this kind of daily all the

1084
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,159
time management strategy for you so it's

1085
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,320
i i think an important question is like

1086
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:27,279
are you continuing to use cannabis

1087
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,760
despite the knowledge that it's making

1088
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,400
you feel worse or that it's interfering

1089
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,760
with your life if that is if it's a yes

1090
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,480
then there's something there that needs

1091
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,480
to be changed

1092
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,480
love it you're okay

1093
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:42,000
no

1094
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,719
no

1095
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,039
so following that

1096
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,319
so a daily use patient you know we hear

1097
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,559
this i don't want to be

1098
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,240
is cannabis addictive

1099
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,519
i think it's habit-forming i don't think

1100
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,239
it's addictive

1101
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,320
is there a difference

1102
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,399
there's psychological addiction versus

1103
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,880
yeah right

1104
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,680
yeah well i i mean i i think maybe what

1105
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,440
you're alluding to is this uh fixation

1106
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,598
like when people have their attention

1107
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,400
fixated on the cannabis and it's like

1108
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,519
starting to consume their life and

1109
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,119
that that i have seen and i think um

1110
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,199
there's certainly a way to kind of

1111
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,000
synchronize with that individual and

1112
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,838
help them kind of restore reward to the

1113
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,400
natural pleasures in their life you know

1114
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,078
cannabis is often the solution to the

1115
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,800
the problem that cannabis chooses it's

1116
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,240
just

1117
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,880
you know or the the problem that

1118
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,159
cannabis causes it's just a an evolution

1119
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,480
in that individual and their

1120
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:39,199
relationship with the plants and it is a

1121
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,679
living dynamic relationship right

1122
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,679
i often feel like i'm not the teacher

1123
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,838
cannabis is the teacher maybe i can help

1124
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,519
interpret what this teacher is saying to

1125
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:49,199
the individual so they know how to

1126
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,759
listen to those lessons and respond and

1127
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,919
make the changes that are indicated

1128
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,200
and i would like to say there is a

1129
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,960
described cannabis withdrawal and thc

1130
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,439
and it's usually only after very high

1131
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,838
doses for quite some time i have seen it

1132
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,800
in pediatric patients i had

1133
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,960
two patients different types of cancer

1134
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,280
both children very young and very sick

1135
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,679
where in california they were receiving

1136
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,760
from my protocol getting chemotherapy

1137
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,919
from an oncologist

1138
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,079
usually some dietary changes and then we

1139
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,079
were using high dose cbd and thc of

1140
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,240
course thc was titrated up and they were

1141
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,400
using it over time and

1142
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,679
both of them ended up being accepted

1143
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,680
into

1144
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,759
clinical trials in other states and the

1145
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:33,039
parents at that time were talking quite

1146
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,200
some time ago

1147
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,119
they were afraid to travel with it and

1148
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,559
neither of them really updated me that

1149
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,559
they were going to be leaving town

1150
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,880
without their thc after their child had

1151
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,960
been on thc for a while because what i

1152
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,920
would have done was weaned it down

1153
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,358
not abruptly stopped it and i got calls

1154
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,280
from both of them

1155
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,880
one a child was at sloan kettering and

1156
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,280
actually a nurse practitioner called me

1157
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,519
and said we've this kid is just wigging

1158
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,319
out and i said well that's what happens

1159
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,880
when you stop high-dose thc on a dime in

1160
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,119
a small child and really what is that

1161
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,680
it's that down regulation of those

1162
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,760
receptors like i showed in that picture

1163
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,078
and now we're just kind of waiting for

1164
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,240
those receptors to kind of come out what

1165
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,519
he just was irritable

1166
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,078
and he didn't really want to eat

1167
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:20,000
anything and uh it was over in just

1168
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,839
about four days i'd say but he was kind

1169
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,318
of miserable those four days

1170
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,559
and so there is and in adults that if

1171
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:29,599
you've known anybody with who takes a

1172
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,599
high dose of thc on a regular basis if

1173
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,760
they uh stop abruptly they might feel

1174
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,440
lousy for a little bit and it's usually

1175
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,280
not so bad they talk about it's a

1176
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,440
two-week period

1177
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,200
and usually the first three to four days

1178
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,559
are the most difficult a lot of people

1179
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:46,159
who want to abstain or cut back by that

1180
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,480
day three or four they kind of can't

1181
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,000
take it so they go back into it and this

1182
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,800
is why

1183
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,280
often times in my experience what i'll

1184
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,880
do is just continue the cbd

1185
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,720
because that will help mitigate some of

1186
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,960
the symptoms and then just wean down the

1187
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,879
thc and you don't have to do it slowly i

1188
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,280
usually basically take 25 percent of the

1189
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,358
dose away every day every three days and

1190
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,200
that seems to do the trick

1191
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,078
that's just my my protocol that i came

1192
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,078
up with

1193
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,560
and i think one of the gifts of cannabis

1194
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,960
so everybody's different but the typical

1195
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,199
cannabis withdrawal syndrome will begin

1196
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,240
usually around 48 hours people might

1197
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:24,318
feel a little off for those first 48 but

1198
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,919
the irritability and loss of appetite

1199
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,719
and trouble sleeping

1200
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,960
usually kicks in around that 48 hour

1201
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:33,279
mark and that's actually about how long

1202
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,280
it takes for people to

1203
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,359
up regulate their cb receptors and

1204
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,760
become more sensitive to cannabis so if

1205
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,440
somebody stops cannabis for 48 hours and

1206
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,920
jumps right back into the dose that they

1207
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,720
were using beforehand they'll have kind

1208
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,358
of nothing gained from that experience

1209
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,919
however if they start at a lower dose

1210
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,078
and just use the the lowest effective

1211
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,079
dose to mitigate those withdrawal

1212
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,000
symptoms if they're having them or to

1213
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,880
cause like a change in their inner

1214
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,960
inventory then they're actually

1215
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,200
contributing to this up regulation of

1216
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,480
their endocannabinoid system now that

1217
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,719
that statement is based on some

1218
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,079
pre-clinical data and what i've observed

1219
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,078
in the clinic

1220
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,400
but but in general i think that this is

1221
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,318
a really forgiving part of this plant

1222
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,240
also that if we build tolerance to it we

1223
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,159
can reverse it quickly and effectively

1224
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,439
without having to endure a brutal

1225
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:26,239
withdrawal period and cbd can help with

1226
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,079
with those 48 hours exercise

1227
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,358
there's all sorts of

1228
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,039
ways to

1229
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:35,119
successfully sensitize one system to thc

1230
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,880
into cannabis and we have a free program

1231
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,400
on healer.com that'll walk you through

1232
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,800
that hold your hand and show you videos

1233
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,400
give you worksheets and other activities

1234
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,039
that you can do to be successful with

1235
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,800
that if any of you are regular moderate

1236
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,800
to heavy cannabis users and you haven't

1237
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,640
tried taking a 48 hour break and

1238
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,480
sensitizing your system i highly

1239
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,400
recommend you give that a shot and see

1240
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,920
what you find

1241
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,440
yeah and i think what is really

1242
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,318
important here too i've seen withdrawals

1243
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,240
with cbd high cbd use

1244
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:04,159
but i think what's what's really

1245
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,519
interesting is if you've ever gone had a

1246
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,318
patient go through withdrawals from

1247
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,759
opioids or ssris or other medications

1248
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:11,519
it's nothing

1249
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,760
compared to the withdrawals they might

1250
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,880
have from cannabis so you know i always

1251
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,880
tell them yeah you might have a little

1252
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,039
diarrhea you might be difficult to be

1253
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,960
around but it'll be over quickly i mean

1254
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,159
my personal experience with opioids was

1255
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,358
a month

1256
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,039
of

1257
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:27,039
withdrawals and symptom management and

1258
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,800
when i said how long is this gonna last

1259
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,239
i said a week and i said well i'm in

1260
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,480
week three

1261
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,679
and he said uh four i mean they just

1262
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,358
don't know right and they don't offer

1263
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:37,598
you any solutions so the good news at

1264
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,920
least with cannabis it's a lot easier to

1265
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,160
come off of if you need to

1266
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,400
thank you um you know following that

1267
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:47,118
what about hyperemesis syndrome with the

1268
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,280
patients at

1269
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,039
are i guess taking is it normally just

1270
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,920
with too much t is it normally that

1271
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:56,559
you're seeing in in teenagers and 20s

1272
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,358
and 30s or it's thc

1273
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,960
related yeah it's usually not medical

1274
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,598
cannabis patients although i've seen two

1275
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,679
cases in my career so that's in my

1276
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,599
career it's not very common but i got

1277
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,919
yelled at by a gi doctor who yelled at

1278
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,359
me and said it's all over the er so how

1279
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,519
come you're not paying attention well

1280
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:15,759
because i work in the medical side of

1281
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,239
this not the adult use slash

1282
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,520
recreational side or where teenagers are

1283
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:23,439
just doing it without some direction

1284
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,920
or self-medicating and again poor

1285
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,920
judgment leading to overuse

1286
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,519
but the two cases that i saw were people

1287
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,880
who went from

1288
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:34,800
kind of um

1289
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:38,480
what i would call moderate thc use to

1290
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:41,119
the very high potency dabbing

1291
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,599
and the concentrates and one patient it

1292
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,760
took six er visits to get the diagnosis

1293
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,359
because she didn't disclose and for

1294
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,960
whatever reason they never did a talk

1295
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,199
screen they thought it was a pelvic

1296
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,400
inflammatory disease or a ruptured

1297
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:54,399
appendix

1298
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,000
she got worked up for a ruptured spleen

1299
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,880
even though she had no

1300
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,559
sign of trauma i mean so there was a lot

1301
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,119
of money spent on her work up and when

1302
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,679
she finally admitted she was very upset

1303
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,838
about it because she felt

1304
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,440
that she did something wrong and now she

1305
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,279
couldn't use cannabis anymore because

1306
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,838
any time that she went back to it she

1307
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,560
would have a recurrence of symptoms

1308
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:19,440
but we were able to get her on some cbd

1309
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:22,480
oil to help with the original

1310
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,400
diagnosis which was anxiety

1311
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,719
and then the second patient i had could

1312
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,960
not go back onto cannabis at all

1313
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,558
or at least thc cannabis no he couldn't

1314
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,240
do it

1315
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,720
and i think it gets complicated if you

1316
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:36,318
have somebody who has chs and they have

1317
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:38,639
to stop abruptly now you're also going

1318
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,400
to possibly have withdrawal symptoms

1319
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,318
i mean it can be really problematic but

1320
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,760
i think there's i've noticed at least in

1321
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,519
my medical practice there are some

1322
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,960
people that end up in that prodromal

1323
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,719
phase where they're not actually

1324
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,559
vomiting yet but they have early morning

1325
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,318
nausea maybe some weight loss maybe some

1326
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,240
diarrhea

1327
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,079
and so i think you know it's really good

1328
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,799
to be aware of the different phases so

1329
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,359
that you can try to catch it

1330
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,200
but i've also i mean dustin and i wrote

1331
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:06,799
up a couple atypical chs cases and

1332
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,159
sometimes they can go back sometimes

1333
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,559
they can't

1334
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:13,838
and i think maybe we should define this

1335
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,200
does anyone want me to define chs

1336
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:16,880
does everybody know what we're talking

1337
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:20,399
about

1338
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,318
okay so cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

1339
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,440
usually occurs to

1340
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:27,440
long-term heavy thc users and it's a

1341
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,599
violent nausea and vomiting episode that

1342
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,880
can last a day or days and it's

1343
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,240
typically

1344
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,440
relieved by

1345
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:38,078
excessive hot bathing and um and that

1346
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,920
heat temporarily turns down the nausea

1347
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,000
now there's another clinical entity

1348
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,079
called cyclic vomiting syndrome that

1349
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
presents very similarly but the

1350
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,599
difference is cannabis can help cyclic

1351
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,079
vomiting syndrome

1352
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,838
the the thing about chs

1353
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,839
is that people don't know it's related

1354
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:55,920
to their cannabis it's not like they

1355
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:57,039
just took a hit and the episode suddenly

1356
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,720
started

1357
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,960
it kind of appears out of nowhere so

1358
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:03,838
they're baffled by it and the

1359
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,480
kind of test to see is this really chs

1360
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:08,799
is stop using cannabis

1361
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,559
for a month and you know see if an

1362
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,640
episode comes back or not now in the

1363
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,599
atypical cases we presented they were

1364
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:17,759
there were some lower gi symptoms uh i

1365
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,640
believe that cbd dominant cannabis in

1366
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,839
both our cases trigger to relapse and

1367
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,078
and so

1368
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,599
so some people are so ultra sensitive or

1369
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,559
maybe it's some of these trace compounds

1370
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,480
that daddy's waiting to discover for us

1371
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,839
and it's not the thc at all that that's

1372
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,079
certainly possible but um i think that

1373
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,639
often like eloise mentioned there's this

1374
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,720
prodromal phase where before the episode

1375
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,719
kicks in if they pay attention

1376
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,799
they're a little off in the morning and

1377
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,039
if they stop using cannabis before it

1378
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,359
goes to this full-blown episode wait a

1379
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,119
few days then that'll subside and they

1380
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,598
can actually start using it again very

1381
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,599
cautiously but never to in my experience

1382
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,359
able to go up to that full high dose

1383
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,920
where they were previously and i've had

1384
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:02,000
about a dozen cases over the years

1385
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,800
and i'd like to point out that dr russo

1386
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,400
and len may from endocanna health did a

1387
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,800
genetic study

1388
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,559
to look at if to see if people were

1389
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,480
genetically predisposed and they found

1390
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,559
some very nice results so i encourage

1391
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,760
you to read that article i think it came

1392
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,760
out last year i believe

1393
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,000
i haven't forgotten you down there

1394
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:23,759
sorry

1395
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,679
i'm good i know the light's blinking

1396
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,839
over there so i had a couple other

1397
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,759
questions but let's just go with um you

1398
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,759
know over the past 12 years i've seen so

1399
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,880
many changes in this industry some good

1400
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,720
some bad

1401
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,200
and some really

1402
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:41,118
uh exciting times ahead what what can

1403
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:44,399
you all add to uh the future of our

1404
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,559
industry and and and beyond

1405
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,400
kevin i'll start with you my friend well

1406
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,920
in terms of the future of the industry i

1407
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,160
mean a couple things need to happen

1408
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:56,318
really bigly politically that needs to

1409
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:58,399
settle down right making access

1410
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:01,279
not making people criminals

1411
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,000
not punishing parents who

1412
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,920
are giving their kids medicinal cannabis

1413
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,760
for good reason

1414
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,240
i think those are really keys but also i

1415
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,640
think quality control and labeling is

1416
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:15,118
still an issue in a lot of states

1417
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:17,118
and you know i come from the natural

1418
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,599
products industry so

1419
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,440
to me we're trying to the cannabis

1420
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,039
industry is trying to reinvent the wheel

1421
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,880
and you don't need to you already have a

1422
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,400
guide the american herbal products

1423
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,400
association will guide you through all

1424
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,280
those steps of what you need to do in

1425
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,240
terms of quality control and and

1426
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,160
labeling and you know all of this so

1427
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:38,719
i think we need to learn from the

1428
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:40,159
existing model that's out there

1429
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,598
to improve

1430
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,239
um our

1431
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,000
safety our quality control our adverse

1432
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:47,279
event reporting i think that's really

1433
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,519
really key

1434
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,960
there are cases of adverse events and we

1435
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:53,358
need to know who they who these people

1436
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,599
are and why they're responding

1437
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:58,000
in a negative way and and that's going

1438
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,440
to propel the industry forward it sounds

1439
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,559
like it has set it back but it won't

1440
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,559
it'll propel it forward

1441
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,039
well i just have one ask and that is to

1442
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,400
get it off the uh controlled substance

1443
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,400
act so we can research it

1444
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,440
when i think about cannabis uh you know

1445
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,880
it seems

1446
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,519
always so perfectly fit to our

1447
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,200
contemporary problems in society our

1448
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:28,400
health problems our psychological

1449
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,919
problems you know you look at this this

1450
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,800
world we're living where there's huge

1451
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,280
amounts of psychological stress and

1452
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,280
cannabis is a solution for that where

1453
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,000
we're you know kind of bathed in this

1454
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,240
environment of toxins many neurotoxins

1455
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,358
we have the neuroprotective effects of

1456
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:48,159
cannabis you know and so on it's often

1457
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:50,799
this solution to our most challenging

1458
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:53,118
problems in healthcare and i you know

1459
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,760
hope that we stay open-minded and allow

1460
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,000
it to kind of evolve with some of these

1461
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,480
challenges one in particular that was

1462
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,760
brought up earlier today is and

1463
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,440
yesterday as well is just the rate of

1464
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,720
mental health challenges that the

1465
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,639
adolescents in our world right now i i

1466
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,558
think it's are experiencing it's just an

1467
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:15,598
incredibly hard time

1468
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:17,680
for most to be a teenager with the

1469
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,000
social media and the the technology

1470
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:22,480
influence and algorithms uh really

1471
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,480
learning quickly how to dictate behavior

1472
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,280
and um you know kind of bring people

1473
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,119
away from their authentic self and

1474
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,960
high stress of this kind of cognitive

1475
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,640
dissonance we're living in a world where

1476
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,400
people are doing things all the time

1477
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,400
that just don't make any sense and

1478
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,079
telling them to to follow these things

1479
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,599
and do them and they might know it

1480
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,079
doesn't make sense but they're doing it

1481
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,960
anyways so i've seen a huge uptick in

1482
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,839
adolescence in my practice and they are

1483
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,599
you know either the parents are

1484
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:51,039
cannabis friendly or cannabis curious

1485
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,039
and bringing them in because they don't

1486
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,039
like these psychiatric options that are

1487
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,279
available or the parents are discovering

1488
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:58,800
that this this kid is using cannabis and

1489
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,040
kind of punishing them and telling them

1490
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,200
to stop and then watching their you know

1491
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:04,159
kind of social interaction and grades

1492
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:06,558
and

1493
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,159
family communication and relationship

1494
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,160
deteriorate and then

1495
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,358
you know telling the pediatrician hey i

1496
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:13,838
think the cannabis was helping

1497
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:16,239
pediatrician says go see dr sulek and we

1498
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,558
we validate what this young person has

1499
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:21,598
already found so that's one example of

1500
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,400
an area where i hope we see

1501
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,119
our

1502
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,039
kind of culture able to embrace cannabis

1503
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,880
for that population as well and i know

1504
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:30,880
it was very helpful for me when i was 15

1505
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,960
years old and i didn't have a fraction

1506
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,480
of the challenges that today's young

1507
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,920
people have

1508
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,079
yeah

1509
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,079
and i hope to see more healthcare

1510
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,240
professionals become educated because

1511
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:45,680
then it increases our advocacy our

1512
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:48,318
opportunities for research our access

1513
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:51,118
you know as healthcare professionals we

1514
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:53,838
often are able to consume if we're

1515
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,079
taking positions at institutions or

1516
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:59,838
organizations that you know try to use

1517
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,359
the 1980s drug place work act to say you

1518
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,199
know you can't test positive i want to

1519
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:04,960
see healthcare workers access this plant

1520
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,199
in a way that's meaningful

1521
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,199
really high burnout rate right now we're

1522
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,639
all talking about mental wellness and

1523
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:13,358
and how to help with the burnout and i'm

1524
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:15,279
like oh oh i know

1525
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:16,960
let us all use cannabis please for the

1526
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,079
love of god you know i think you'll see

1527
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,599
much

1528
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,200
happier

1529
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,200
health care workers not that they need

1530
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:25,439
to consume at work

1531
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:27,118
but i just i want us to i mean we all

1532
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,639
deserve choices most so many of us

1533
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,798
raised our hands that we're patients

1534
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:32,558
right we deserve choices um so

1535
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:33,920
congratulate for be yourself for being

1536
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,060
here today and getting educated and

1537
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,159
being part of the change

1538
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:40,239

we're all the pebble in the pond that

1542
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:50,078
hits that ripple effect so

1554
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,159
i'm gonna do my put up my scrapbook

1555
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:16,480
all right i've got a question over here

1556
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:19,838
in the in the recreational market we're

1557
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:23,599
seeing um an increase in the use of nano

1558
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:25,920
emulsions to make the cannabinoids water

1559
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,838
not water soluble but

1560
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,079
immersed in in water products so

1561
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,599
beverages are coming online

1562
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,440
gummy products are being made with nano

1563
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,519
emulsions i haven't heard anybody talk

1564
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,519
about those types of products here and i

1565
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,838
was wondering if anybody could comment

1566
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,838
on patients that are using maybe these

1567
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,318
new nano emulsion products and how the

1568
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:46,000
dosing of those could be different from

1569
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,318
the dose of traditional products because

1570
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,318
of more rapid absorption

1571
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,159
sure so you know i think one part of

1572
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:54,079
that is getting the

1573
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,318
the cannabinoids and other compounds

1574
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,160
into a matrix that's desirable and i you

1575
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:00,558
know that's fine if if somebody prefers

1576
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:02,480
to have it in a water-based beverage and

1577
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:06,160
it it gets in there better that that's

1578
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:08,559
okay um when it comes to claims about

1579
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,078
increased bioavailability meaning you

1580
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,559
know i can take a lower dose and it's

1581
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,039
going to have a stronger effect i

1582
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,880
we've seen very little data supporting

1583
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,039
any of those claims i think a couple

1584
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,519
companies have published a little bit

1585
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:24,318
and what we've seen is that there can be

1586
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:26,559
like a three to four fold increase in

1587
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:28,400
absorption from some of these nano

1588
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,720
emulsions and other technologies now

1589
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,880
it's also important to know that if you

1590
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:35,598
take oral cannabinoids with fat

1591
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,640
containing food you'll also see about a

1592
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,039
three to five fold increase and um and

1593
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,798
so the the cost benefit of some of these

1594
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,558
technologies which do raise the cost of

1595
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:46,559
the product typically i think we could

1596
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,880
probably just achieve that by by taking

1597
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,400
it with food and you know for for the

1598
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,480
consumers out there if somebody's

1599
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,160
advertising something fancy and new

1600
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,318
that's going to improve the delivery of

1601
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:58,078
cannabis i'm all for it i would just you

1602
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:59,679
know invite the company to show us the

1603
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,640
proof that it's doing what they say it's

1604
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,159
doing

1605
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:04,318
yeah i agree i think there are a lot of

1606
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,318
unsubstantiated marketing claims in the

1607
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:07,920
industry and working with knowledgeable

1608
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:11,358
healthcare professionals can really help

1609
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,358
a patient make good choices

1610
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:16,880
first i want to thank you all for being

1611
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,759
here i'm really excited to have you all

1612
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,480
in one place to ask this question

1613
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,799
over the last couple of years with the

1614
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,000
passage of the farm bill we've seen a

1615
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:27,920
lot of

1616
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,280
other cannabinoids hitting the market

1617
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,200
delta 8 delta 10 hhc some of those types

1618
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,960
of things and i'd like to hear what your

1619
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:37,598
opinion is on some of those products

1620
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:41,039
that are trying to circumvent the thc

1621
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:43,599
laws and prohibition estates

1622
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:46,798
okay sure well my my first concern is

1623
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,880
residual solvents um

1624
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:50,798
that that's obviously an issue and it's

1625
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,119
been an issue in the past as well i know

1626
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:55,599
in in oregon we had this problem

1627
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,519
uh i think that the other cannabinoids

1628
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,440
um you know for the most part we've got

1629
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:01,838
pre-clinical research

1630
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,639
we don't have a lot of human research

1631
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,639
that doesn't mean necessarily that

1632
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:08,639
you know we can't use them but if

1633
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:10,159
they're isolated and we can get much

1634
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,078
higher doses

1635
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:13,358
i tend to fall on the safety side you

1636
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,880
know these things have never been

1637
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:16,558
isolated and we've never taken them at

1638
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,000
higher doses it's that they've always

1639
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,760
been in a mix as minor cannabinoids so

1640
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,159
that makes me feel better to think of it

1641
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,760
that way than isolating a bunch of stuff

1642
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:27,679
that we've never

1643
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,079
tested on humans or even pre-clinical

1644
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,159
research

1645
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,400
can i just chime in so the way it's been

1646
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:37,279
explained to me is that the delta eight

1647
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,079
thc that's on the hemp market now is not

1648
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,319
from

1649
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:43,519
directly from the plant it goes through

1650
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:46,159
a what's called acid catalysis from cbd

1651
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,960
to delta eight and the concern there is

1652
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:48,879
that

1653
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,199
uh you may convert let's say eighty

1654
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,440
percent of that cbd over but then the

1655
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:55,598
rest what are those and they basically

1656
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,599
saying they're uncharacterized

1657
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,680
either cannabinoids or something else

1658
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,119
and nobody knows so far i'm waiting for

1659
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,960
somebody to say oh i figured out what

1660
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:06,000
those are

1661
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,519
and the concern is what are they and are

1662
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,960
they safe for you

1663
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,039
so that that's the way it's been

1664
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,079
described to me i have had a few

1665
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:17,119
patients use delta eight with some nice

1666
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,798
results with anxiety in lower doses and

1667
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,880
especially in patients who don't seem to

1668
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:24,639
tolerate delta nine but there's still

1669
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:27,440
that concern of safety

1670
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:29,118
yeah i'm okay with people experimenting

1671
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,798
on themselves you know i think life's a

1672
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,160
big experiment

1673
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:33,838
um

1674
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:35,440
you know that that's all right i think

1675
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,440
we they should just do so with the

1676
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,039
knowledge that there's probably uh

1677
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,559
unidentified compounds that they're

1678
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,239
consuming and

1679
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,920
we don't know what that's going to do to

1680
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:45,838
them and it's probably going to be

1681
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,440
different from one preparation to the

1682
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,039
next

1683
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,200
yeah and i don't think our testing is

1684
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:53,519
very sophisticated either so that's

1685
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:54,960
another concern where you can see there

1686
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,519
was a report that came out i think it

1687
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,000
said like 56 percent of at least delta 8

1688
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,920
products were mislabeled you know we saw

1689
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,599
that with cbd as well and there's a lot

1690
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,240
of people that um don't realize that

1691
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,359
there's also likely to be delta 9 thc in

1692
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:10,318
some of these products so it can be

1693
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:12,960
quite impairing

1694
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:15,358
nicole i um thank you very much for

1695
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,440
being here and for doing all that you do

1696
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:20,159
um my my question is this one of the

1697
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,679
things that we're finding as we speak to

1698
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:23,358
the practitioners

1699
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:26,318
um is

1700
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,440
their fear of stepping into this

1701
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:29,920
culture

1702
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,039
um my question to you because all of you

1703
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,400
are so open and especially dr goldstein

1704
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:37,759
because this is

1705
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,318
um directed uh for someone who we know

1706
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,280
who is a pediatrician that we're trying

1707
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:43,759
to help

1708
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,280
move into that cannabis space

1709
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:49,520
what recommendations do you have just

1710
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,200
to communicate to the doctors the

1711
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:53,280
practitioners

1712
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:56,798
anything to to

1713
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:59,839
kind of allow them to step into this

1714
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,199
question so i i had a little difficulty

1715
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,679
hearing you but you're asking me what

1716
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,038
would i say to other pediatricians well

1717
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,199
what i would say is your fears are

1718
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:10,160
unfounded because i'm the biggest

1719
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:12,558
chicken around and i'm doing this so

1720
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:15,118
it is your fears are unfounded and it's

1721
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,798
based on research from the you know dare

1722
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:20,079
to say no

1723
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:21,838
time and even from before that but

1724
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,680
everybody talks to me all the time what

1725
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:25,599
about the brain development about this i

1726
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:27,679
just don't see issues and if i saw

1727
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,880
issues of course i would step in do no

1728
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,199
harm right

1729
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,838
so i'm not ignoring my patients and you

1730
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:36,000
can tell by my slides and my talk i am

1731
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:38,159
heavily involved in my patients lives i

1732
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,480
mean i have some patients that email me

1733
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,318
three times a day with pictures so

1734
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,719
we are very there i'm like closer to

1735
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:46,798
them than i am to some family members

1736
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:49,279
if something goes south and i stress

1737
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:51,119
this at every you know talk with the

1738
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,440
first the first appointment and every

1739
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,640
talk after if there's a downside of a

1740
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,159
side effect

1741
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:58,798
anything you're worried about there is

1742
01:02:56,159 --> 01:03:00,078
no stupid email or phone call you just

1743
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:03,280
let me know

1744
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:06,400
i try to prepare people but in general

1745
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,400
if you are practicing good medicine the

1746
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,119
same way you practice any other good

1747
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:14,000
medicine whether it's rheumatology or

1748
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,039
hematology oncology and you know

1749
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,719
um

1750
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,079
especially with cannabis it's a lot

1751
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,159
safer because you're really not going to

1752
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,920
harm anybody you may not find the answer

1753
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:23,358
right out of the gate but if someone's

1754
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,798
willing to work with you you usually can

1755
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:26,480
find some benefit

1756
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:28,079
the fears are unfounded and i've been

1757
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,400
saying this for years and yet there's

1758
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,079
still a tremendous fear factor and part

1759
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,838
of that is

1760
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,280
the ignorance because you don't know

1761
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:37,119
because you haven't had a chance to read

1762
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,319
the research so it's just a matter of

1763
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,920
education

1764
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:41,838
but i think part of it too once someone

1765
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,599
once said to me doctors are really good

1766
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:45,599
students they're taught something once

1767
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:46,880
and they hang on to it for life

1768
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,798
so

1769
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,798
it's very hard to undo

1770
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:52,719
i wanted to add to that you know this

1771
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:54,798
came up earlier and it's i think a

1772
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:57,519
little better for nurse practitioners

1773
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:59,759
but physicians have the highest suicide

1774
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,400
rate of any profession

1775
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,599
we are mostly damaged

1776
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:08,639
by our training incredibly close minded

1777
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:10,880
and rigid in our thinking and scared of

1778
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:13,118
things that we've been told to be scared

1779
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,400
of and so we don't learn very well while

1780
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,640
we're scared our brains are not

1781
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,240
discerned designed to learn when we're

1782
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,318
scared we're designed to react

1783
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:21,919
emotionally and so when you find an

1784
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:24,159
intelligent person that's reacting

1785
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,960
emotionally the first step has to be to

1786
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:29,199
help them feel safe and comfortable and

1787
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,798
do something that will help disarm them

1788
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:33,199
and you know i think there's a variety

1789
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:34,798
of of ways that we can just synchronize

1790
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:37,519
with the the person we're talking to

1791
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:40,239
this isn't about breaking through to

1792
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:42,400
them and getting the truth to them

1793
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,399
that's that's not the effective strategy

1794
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,920
the effective strategy is basically like

1795
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,920
sit there with this scared rigid

1796
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,318
thinking individual that's missing an

1797
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,240
opportunity to really like help a lot of

1798
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:54,159
people and have a much more meaningful

1799
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:55,279
career sit with them and see how you can

1800
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:56,960
love them

1801
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,798
like look at them and love them that's

1802
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,639
probably a really nice first step

1803
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:03,440
that'll change the vibration in in the

1804
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:05,279
room and um and then maybe like take a

1805
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,200
different tack like not for their

1806
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,119
patients maybe this could be something

1807
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:12,078
for themselves or for their mom who's

1808
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,160
got arthritis or someone else say no and

1809
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:16,400
just kind of find where those inroads

1810
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:17,679
are and then i say this from experience

1811
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,000
it's gotten a lot better when i used to

1812
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:21,519
be in front of a crowd of doctors not at

1813
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,519
a cannabis conference but a different

1814
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:25,199
conference you could feel the energy in

1815
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,038
the room like

1816
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:29,838
you know they would be it would be so

1817
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,039
intense uh the fear about the words that

1818
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:33,358
were going to come out of my mouth there

1819
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,520
was no way i could teach a crowd like

1820
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:37,679
that you know and and now it's it the

1821
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:40,400
the work has gotten a lot easier you

1822
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:42,318
know because people are i think you know

1823
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,480
and i mentioned this in my book um

1824
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:46,318
cannabis is not just a solution for the

1825
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,280
patients it's a solution for the

1826
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:51,358
practitioners uh and for the system

1827
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,839
itself it's a solution for their

1828
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,679
miserable practices that are you know

1829
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:57,838
full of toxic tools that are ineffective

1830
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:59,440
and it's a solution for their personal

1831
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:02,798
lives if we can weave it in there

1832
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,880
somehow so those are some of my ideas

1833
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:07,519
that's that's great i mean i need to

1834
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,358
applaud that right there yeah

1835
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:11,119
and i i think so much of it is false

1836
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:13,119
evidence appearing real you know that's

1837
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,880
the fear for me going now into

1838
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,559
palliative care at stanford i'm going to

1839
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,480
be prescribing opioids for the first

1840
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,200
time in my career and i'm way more

1841
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,318
scared of that than i am cannabis so you

1842
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:25,519
know it's all about perspective

1843
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,318
and

1844
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:29,838
i want self-promotion so i think you all

1845
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:33,838
have books right

1846
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:33,838
sort of sort of anyway look

1847
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:38,639
lola

1848
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:41,359
ah yes sir so uh thank you so much uh

1849
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,558
guys for what you're doing in this space

1850
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:45,440
okay

1851
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,519
yeah this is really great

1852
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,798
i hate this stuffed

1853
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:49,599
car

1854
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:52,719
okay

1855
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,960
so my quest i'm a clinical pharmacist a

1856
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:57,358
cannabis psychological consultant i'm

1857
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,400
also a cannabis educator

1858
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:01,920
so earlier when dr bostin was talking

1859
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,400
she said

1860
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,880
about the route of administration first

1861
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,200
of all where i'm coming from

1862
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,798
when it comes to cannabis and not even

1863
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:15,279
just cannabis medication drugs generally

1864
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:17,440
i believe is all in your

1865
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:20,000
route of administration

1866
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,880
and your dosing and when you look at

1867
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,559
conventional medicine

1868
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:29,440
big farmers they have perfected the acts

1869
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:32,079
of route of administration and one of

1870
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,480
those areas is in your transdermal

1871
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:37,839
patches like your fentanyl

1872
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,240
and suppository those are one of our

1873
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:43,199
effective the most effective

1874
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:45,838
agent uh routes that we have so i would

1875
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:49,118
say that when we look at the way we are

1876
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:51,599
seeing cannabis as a support city we are

1877
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,920
fee we have a feeling is not

1878
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:56,880
really where we need it to be

1879
01:07:53,920 --> 01:08:00,079
do you guys think this is a way this is

1880
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:03,119
an area where we can actually

1881
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:06,798
collaborate with the big farmers

1882
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:09,440
uh when we eventually get into that area

1883
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:12,559
where we have legalization and everybody

1884
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:16,239
can actually come into the opens

1885
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:19,279
and embrace this uh these plans because

1886
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:22,479
i really do feel that support c3

1887
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:25,120
is is gonna be a game changer as well as

1888
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:27,039
transdemo approaches

1889
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:29,519
i i think that

1890
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:31,759
we could advance cannabis in that way i

1891
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,880
have to say in 13 years of clinical

1892
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:37,198
practice i can't recall when i've been

1893
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,279
dissatisfied with my available routes of

1894
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:41,039
administration what we've got right now

1895
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:43,120
seems to be working very well maybe it's

1896
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:44,880
not the most cost effective but then

1897
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:47,439
again newer technologies that can

1898
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,920
enhance bioavailability they have a cost

1899
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,599
as well so i i i think we'll probably

1900
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,560
make progress there but i don't see that

1901
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,560
as a priority in cannabis i'm curious

1902
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,400
what my panelists think

1903
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,560
for me personally i just feel like

1904
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:03,519
especially when you're thinking about

1905
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,759
cancer or folks that have

1906
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,520
nausea and vomiting especially when

1907
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:10,079
you're looking at the

1908
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,239
uh the fact that when you use a

1909
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,559
sublingual rod of administration we

1910
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:18,079
don't even know what about availability

1911
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:20,960
of these agents are and we already have

1912
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:24,479
proven routes of administration

1913
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:27,198
that is extremely effective that's why

1914
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:29,678
we have problems with fentanyl

1915
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:32,158
that is one of the main reasons why we

1916
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:35,119
have problems with fennel because of the

1917
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:37,039
way the absorption rate i think that

1918
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:40,000
when someone needs a parenteral route of

1919
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:42,238
administration the lungs is ideal the

1920
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,359
onset is so rapid it's very easy to

1921
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:46,639
titrate again i'm not really seeing the

1922
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,798
need

1923
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,798
but but there are some patients that do

1924
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,719
better with a patch eloise presented

1925
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:55,039
that case and thank goodness for that

1926
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,399
ultra sensitive outlier that there was a

1927
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,479
patch available

1928
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:01,279
i think maybe patches i would love to

1929
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:03,439
see more variety and opportunities for

1930
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:04,880
four patches in the market i mean i'm

1931
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:07,519
very limited and they're very very

1932
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,039
expensive but sometimes they are

1933
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,920
game changers

1934
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:11,359
okay

1935
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,440
thank you guys for what you do

1936
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:15,920
appreciate that

1937
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:18,238
yeah and i'm just gonna chime in here if

1938
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,840
i'm not anti-pharma but i do think

1939
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:21,678
pharma is at the root of a lot of

1940
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,760
problems in medicine

1941
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,840
if you if we try to collaborate with

1942
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,520
pharma with cannabis they're just going

1943
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,800
to take it away from you

1944
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,560
that's what they're going to do it's all

1945
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,560
about corporate it's all about profit

1946
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:56,000
we're not being exclusive we're being

1947
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,039
inclusive

1948
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,039
that's the way i see this is a

1949
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:01,220
grassroots movement

1950
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:04,328
it's not exclusive

1951
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,329
[Music]

1952
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:36,719
yeah i don't think anyone else here yeah

1953
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,560
i'm sorry because the rest of the room

1954
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,399
can't hear you unfortunately but the

1955
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,840
message is that we can collaborate and i

1956
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:44,158
think that's a great one we don't have

1957
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,079
to be anti-pharma i don't think that's

1958
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:48,158
that's going to help us but we have to

1959
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:49,760
know them for what they are and and

1960
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:51,679
recognize the patterns of history and

1961
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,000
the way that they've behaved we can

1962
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:56,719
invite them to behave differently and

1963
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,880
maybe if again if cannabis becomes a

1964
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:02,719
bigger part of their lives they might do

1965
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,679
that let's let's take the next question

1966
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,520
thanks

1967
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:06,640
dr goldstein mentioned the one patient

1968
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,719
who had

1969
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:11,360
repeated hospitalizations and that

1970
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:13,679
seemed to be solved with the low dosage

1971
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:15,679
thc i was just wondering what was the

1972
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,440
actual dosage and what would you define

1973
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:20,480
is that low dose range

1974
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:22,399
sure he he actually was inhaling with a

1975
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,799
flower vaporizer so i don't really know

1976
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,479
but he would just take one or two puffs

1977
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,640
and he would spread it out throughout

1978
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:30,639
the day so it was kind of like micro

1979
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,520
dosing via inhalation

1980
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,719
all day long and it just kept him even

1981
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,480
and so

1982
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:38,000
he found that that was the best way to

1983
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:40,000
do it and i didn't want to change that i

1984
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,079
wanted him to be able to decide how he

1985
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,560
what worked best for him and this was

1986
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:45,439
flour not oil it was flour

1987
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,920
yes

1988
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:50,079
he would buy flour and he used not a

1989
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:53,760
volcano but kind of like a one-off from

1990
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:56,800
a volcano type bag vaporizer

1991
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,480
so i have a few things to add to this

1992
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,320
someone asked a question earlier and a

1993
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:02,158
paper came out today that may have shed

1994
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:04,399
some light on this it's in chem archive

1995
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:06,799
from monger at all and it is vaping

1996
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:09,359
cannabinoid acids leads to ketene

1997
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,960
formation which is a poisonous gas they

1998
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:13,519
think may have been involved in a valley

1999
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,840
with vitamin e acetate so

2000
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,120
um encourage people if you're looking at

2001
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,039
some of these other products this is

2002
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:20,399
specifically about delta eight and delta

2003
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:22,000
eight acetate which might be some of

2004
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,399
these other delta eights that are

2005
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,158
showing up in this this acid catalyze

2006
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:27,839
catalyzation but

2007
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:29,279
something new that just published today

2008
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,199
that may shed some light on what are in

2009
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:33,359
these vape pens

2010
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,439
but i'm also going to add to this that

2011
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:37,679
