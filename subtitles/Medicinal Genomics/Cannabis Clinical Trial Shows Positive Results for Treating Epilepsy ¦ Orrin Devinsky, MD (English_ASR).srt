i'm warren divinsky the director of the

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,309
NYU epilepsy center and I'm excited to

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,559
be part of this year's can med

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,379
conference there are some exciting

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:25,769
findings from the GW at the dialect

9
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:28,289
studies of cannabidiol the first three

10
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,739
randomized placebo-controlled trials

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:35,129
have all found positive results that is

12
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,560
in the Dravet study the primary endpoint

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,600
was change in the frequency of

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,390
convulsive seizures and there was a

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,910
statistically significant reduction

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,250
using cannabidiol and the two lennox

17
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:50,599
guests those studies both of which had

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,399
dropped seizures as the primary endpoint

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,609
again both of those studies found

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,280
statistically significant results with

21
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,390
regards to a reduction in seizures with

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,469
the cannabidiol

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,170
so after thousands of years of humans

24
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,938
and doctors using cannabis based

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,998
products to treat epilepsy

26
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:15,478
we now have firm scientific evidence

27
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:18,568
that the cannabidiol portion of canvas

28
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,829
can work for some selected forms of

29
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:43,560
epilepsy and we're very excited

30
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:43,560
