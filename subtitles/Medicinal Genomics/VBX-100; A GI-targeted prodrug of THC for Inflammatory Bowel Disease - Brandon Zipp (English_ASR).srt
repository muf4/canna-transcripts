1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,519
hi my name is Brandon zip I'm the

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,009
director of R&amp;D and the scientific

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,910
co-founder for vitality biopharma today

4
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:16,059
I'm going to talk to you about this

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,600
novel pro drug that we're developing for

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,839
inflammatory bowel disease so first off

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,370
yes I'm an employee of the company and

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,189
our lawyer has required me to put this

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,480
safe harbor statement so if you have any

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,320
questions check out our website or our

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,730
public filings so diving right into it

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,170
so inflammatory bowel disease so really

13
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:40,358
for those of you who don't are not

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,129
familiar with it it's a umbrella term it

15
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:44,980
includes both Crohn's disease and also

16
00:00:42,128 --> 00:00:47,439
ulcerative colitis these are both

17
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:49,029
chronic inflammatory disorders so it's

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,948
an overactive immune response that's

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,510
attacking the intestinal epithelium of

20
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:58,718
the the intestines so there are no cures

21
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:59,920
for IBD this is something that these

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,478
patients are going to live with their

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,260
entire life so it needs to be treated

24
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:08,439
and managed and some of the side effects

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,000
that are seen in IBD patients yeah

26
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,629
chronic inflammation diarrhea abdominal

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,129
pain there's a lot of pain as well as

28
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:17,589
there's also morphological there's

29
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:23,728
strictures fistulas and other problems

30
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:26,409
also higher incidence of colon cancer so

31
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:29,049
the prevalence of the of IBD in the

32
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:32,469
United States is is really high so 1.3

33
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:34,299
percent of Americans that's over three

34
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:37,809
million 'aa million Americans that are

35
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:39,430
affected by IBD it's prevalent also in

36
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:44,409
Western diet and other Western

37
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:47,070
lifestyles so the current treatment

38
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:49,420
goals for IBD consist of initially

39
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,339
inducing remission and then also

40
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,140
maintaining it so sort of a first line

41
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,240
would be you know prescription of

42
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,530
corticosteroids to you know put out the

43
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,899
fires and decrease the initial

44
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,269
inflammation but of course that can't be

45
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,248
used indefinitely you have other small

46
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:07,709
molecules like the amino salicylates and

47
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:10,810
you get into the immunosuppressants and

48
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,729
immunosuppressants work well except for

49
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,489
the the side effects of suppressed

50
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:17,408
immune system and risk of infections you

51
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:18,590
also have the infliximab and a dilute at

52
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:20,479
a

53
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,150
which are the biologics which are anti

54
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:27,259
TNF alpha inhibitors which Eastin kind

55
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,959
of touched on and so despite all of

56
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:32,598
these options you know IBD patients are

57
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,640
still facing 25 to 40 percent of IBD

58
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:36,348
patients will face surgery to remove

59
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,529
part of their bowels to deal with this

60
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:42,560
disease you know some of these patients

61
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,659
are going to require ileostomy bags and

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,670
some for the rest of their lives and all

63
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:48,859
of this despite the fact that you know

64
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:53,598
we as as Americans we spend 10 billion

65
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:56,269
dollars a year treating IBD so it's just

66
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:59,810
well II inadequate for the disease State

67
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:02,030
and we have a family friend who their

68
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,280
little daughter has Crohn's disease and

69
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,140
watching her go through the treatments

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,180
and she finally has it under control but

71
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:09,649
it's just heartbreaking to watch what

72
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:16,430
happens to the patients as well as the

73
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:18,980
families and so we so another troubling

74
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,500
trend is that opioid use or opioid

75
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,750
prescriptions for IBD have been

76
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,120
increasing so on the left you can see

77
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,030
over the 23 years have been monitored

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,009
the steady increase in the use of

79
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,909
opioids including strong opioids and

80
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:37,159
this is a adult data out of England the

81
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:40,098
same data is clear in the United States

82
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,659
if not more so and this I pulled this

83
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:43,459
statistic out of a recent paper in a

84
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:46,519
couple months ago that in the United

85
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:50,689
States nearly 20% of adolescents so 19

86
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,629
to 30 have been have received a chronic

87
00:03:50,689 --> 00:04:02,810
opioid therapy to address their chronic

88
00:03:53,629 --> 00:04:04,668
intestinal pain so enough of the

89
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,949
depressing stuff so let's move on this

90
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:09,859
is Ken med let's talk about cannabis and

91
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:11,298
so one really interesting resource is

92
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:13,730
that Crohn's disease patients have this

93
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,788
online forum called chronology org in

94
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:17,839
which they can discuss sort of the they

95
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:19,579
can discuss what they're going through

96
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,098
treatments that are working for them and

97
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,019
they can rate the how effective the

98
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:26,240
medications you know that they're trying

99
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:28,430
and how it's working for them and so if

100
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,560
you look at this the number one most

101
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,629
effective reported treatment

102
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,870
is medical cannabis and this is above

103
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:38,389
this is above both the best-in-class

104
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:43,269
anti TNF alpha antibodies on number two

105
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:48,009
and further down so what is the data

106
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:50,329
supporting the use of cannabis for IBD

107
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,759
so a lot of the studies that have been

108
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:54,409
performed have been more observational

109
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,810
due to the inability to directly

110
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,930
prescribe but also because of the very

111
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,509
legal status but what's clear is that so

112
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,189
on the left store has reported that you

113
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,680
know in patients with Crohn's disease

114
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,410
that are receiving medical cannabis they

115
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,060
have decreased abdominal pain cramping

116
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,120
joint pain and diarrhea

117
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,370
similarly work out of Timnath Dali's

118
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,759
group has shown that for an eight-week

119
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,959
course of cannabis she sees significant

120
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,870
decreases in the Crohn's disease

121
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:27,829
activity index so over on the right

122
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,959
so there's this trend downward in their

123
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:32,509
inflammation and their disease status

124
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:35,509
and one really cool thing about on the

125
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:38,089
right is that the patients that we're

126
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:40,490
taking opioids for their you know

127
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,839
chronic intestinal pain we're able to

128
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:46,340
come off of them during the course of

129
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:49,429
the study shifting from Crohn's disease

130
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:50,689
to ulcerative colitis you know similar

131
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,800
results have been seen during an

132
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:53,719
eight-week course of treatment with

133
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,960
medical cannabis you see an improvement

134
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,990
in the colitis scores as seen by

135
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:02,089
colonoscopy as well as on the table on

136
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,610
the right shows that when patients are

137
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:06,888
receiving medical cannabis they're able

138
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,250
to go off of their other IBD medications

139
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:14,960
so this all looks great but what is the

140
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:17,629
what's the catch and so a report that

141
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,019
came out that was I think 2017 this came

142
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:23,240
out and this was funded by GW Pharma

143
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:27,620
it's a great study and they were using a

144
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,300
CBD rich botanical extract but they

145
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,530
didn't meet there so the data looks very

146
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,509
suggestive but they didn't meet their

147
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:34,668
primary endpoints because the patients

148
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:37,159
stopped taking the drug so they had non

149
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:38,899
adherence and when you look at what they

150
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,300
were giving the patients so they were

151
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:44,079
escalating these patients up to an oral

152
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,319
dose of CBD that contained up to 20

153
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,990
three and a half mix of THC daily so the

154
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,550
patients reported dizziness and psycho

155
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,110
activity and they just stopped taking

156
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,509
what they were supposed to be taking so

157
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,860
psycho activity is a real problem in

158
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,449
patients that they don't necessarily

159
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,689
want to get high they just want to get

160
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:04,330
better and so to address this vitality

161
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:06,009
has developed a new class of

162
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:08,500
cannabinoids so if you're familiar with

163
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:11,020
endocannabinoids as well as phyto

164
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,029
cannabinoids of course and then so we

165
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:14,799
have created this new category that are

166
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:17,408
called cannabis sides or cannibal

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,478
cannabinoid glycosides in which we've

168
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:22,149
functionalized cannabinoids through the

169
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:25,810
hydroxyl hydroxyl on the resorcinol ring

170
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:28,478
with sugars and so we do this with

171
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,490
proprietary enzyme and a method and

172
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,769
we're performing this new production of

173
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,620
these cannabinoids at our DEA approved

174
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:37,959
R&amp;D facility outside of Sacramento so

175
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,019
we've we've generated a library of

176
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,478
almost 150 of unique cannabinoid

177
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:47,528
glycosides with different structures and

178
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:50,589
base molecules and our lead candidate

179
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:52,060
right now is vbx 100 so it's THC

180
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:56,049
molecule that's been functionalized with

181
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:58,360
three different glucoses on it for the

182
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,088
chemists in the room like Jonathan so

183
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,000
one main change with this when we

184
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:06,129
glycosylated the the water solubility

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,158
increases greatly so we have decreased

186
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:11,500
hydrophobicity and it's seen by 3 log

187
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:15,069
orders a change or improvement over th

188
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,629
see when we occupy that hydroxyl group

189
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:18,819
on the resorcinol ring we also see a

190
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:21,370
stability increase so these compounds

191
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:22,990
are more resistant to degradation and

192
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,028
also another chemistry term is that

193
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,158
these molecules now have this big polar

194
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:30,819
sugar head but they still have the

195
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:31,810
hydrophobic THC backbone and tail and so

196
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,990
the chemistry term for that is

197
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,788
amphipathic or two phases and one

198
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,028
interesting thing that results from that

199
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:42,759
is that they no longer are totally happy

200
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:44,500
in a lipid or a solvent environment but

201
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:47,049
they're also not totally happy in an

202
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,480
aqueous or water environment so we see

203
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:51,429
decreased association with membranes we

204
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,579
also see that they no longer bind to the

205
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:56,349
receptors or transporters and so the

206
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:58,029
main result of this is that these

207
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,830
compounds stay in the gut

208
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:05,620
so they don't get absorbed so they stay

209
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,090
in the gut and they transit through to

210
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,090
the large intestine and then we see

211
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:12,070
something really cool happen so vbx 100

212
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,320
with these sugars on it makes it to the

213
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,480
large intestine and they're these

214
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,250
enzymes so they encounter hungry

215
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,289
microbes so I think Ethan's talk is a

216
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:24,179
great primer for this so we have a

217
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:24,179
tremendous amount of gut microbes

218
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,479
predominantly you know they encounter

219
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:30,789
the steep increase the distal ileum and

220
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,399
the colon and when they encounter that

221
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:35,679
these hungry microbes are secreting

222
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,779
these enzymes that pop the sugars off

223
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,870
and release THC and then it's not

224
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:43,629
absorbed so the THC we have a site

225
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:49,659
directed delivery of THC to the lumen of

226
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:52,210
the large intestine these glycoside Pro

227
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:55,059
drugs it's a pro drug in that its THC

228
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,400
glycosides that then delivers and so it

229
00:09:55,059 --> 00:10:00,909
gets activated and it delivers THC where

230
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:05,289
we want this glycoside prodrome pro drug

231
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:07,120
paradigm is nothing new so all of these

232
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:09,009
are examples of glycoside Pro drugs that

233
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,779
target the intestines notably scent

234
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:14,080
asides which are the main ingredient in

235
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:15,789
Seneca or X Lacs same mechanism they go

236
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,520
to the gut and then the sugars get

237
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:21,730
popped off and the active is released so

238
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,370
we have this drug that targets THC

239
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,899
delivery to the large intestine so we

240
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,149
wanted to test how does this work for

241
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,970
ulcerative colitis so we turn to the

242
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:33,579
predominant colitis model and rodents

243
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,470
and so here you can see over on the left

244
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,930
this is histopathology information from

245
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,149
the animals upper left is the sham or

246
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:43,449
the untreated or sorry it's a healthy

247
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:46,838
intestines on the upper right is T and V

248
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,610
s let's see if I've got this we have T

249
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,850
and BS plus the vehicle so this is the

250
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,470
induced colitis untreated and then on

251
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,450
the bottom we have induced colitis and

252
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,089
then treatment with either VB X 100 our

253
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,430
novel THC pro drug or cyclosporine a

254
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,290
which is an immunosuppressant and both

255
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:05,259
of them significantly significantly

256
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:09,338
improve the colitis scores in these

257
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:11,649
histopathology so we also see decreased

258
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:13,899
myeloperoxidase which is an inflammatory

259
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,419
marker its neutrophils that are

260
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:17,649
infiltrating into the tissue there's

261
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:20,618
less blood in the stools of these

262
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:23,318
animals improved colon morphology as

263
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:25,778
well as stool consistency and so one

264
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:28,838
homework of this model this mirroring

265
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:30,549
colitis TN BSN deuce model is actually a

266
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,970
severe shortening of the colons

267
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:36,248
and so these are some of the colons that

268
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,069
we see and so on the left is the sham or

269
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:41,079
the healthy colon from the cecum oops

270
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:45,278
sorry

271
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:47,558
from the cecum down to the anus and so

272
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,778
vehicle is the induced disease state

273
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:52,028
that's untreated and then we did a dose

274
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:54,129
response curve with our drug and so we

275
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:56,799
see this nice dose response up into a

276
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:58,928
point where we don't get any additional

277
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,389
benefit but we also don't see any

278
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:02,919
toxicity incurred by these higher doses

279
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:06,419
and this is all compared to the

280
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:11,078
immunosuppressant cyclosporine a and so

281
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:13,328
we're we're treating these as a pro drug

282
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:14,979
and because they're so tightly targeted

283
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:18,008
to the large intestine were able to

284
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,899
greatly decrease the dose so we're able

285
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:22,870
to give these animals a very low dose

286
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:24,610
and then potentiate or get an effect

287
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,909
through the endocannabinoids system at

288
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,740
physiological relevant concentrations

289
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:31,539
but we've also pushed this concentration

290
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,389
really high and this sort of illustrates

291
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:36,248
how targeted it is to the gut and so we

292
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:40,360
gave this thousand milligram per

293
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:41,740
kilogram dose to these rats and then we

294
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,839
looked at the systemic plasma

295
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,778
concentration for THC that was released

296
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:50,499
so we did see some but they peaked at an

297
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:52,688
average of 20 nanograms per mil just for

298
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:54,308
example so a typical you know cannabis

299
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,230
cigarette would give someone or the

300
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:59,948
average of like sixty nanograms per mil

301
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,839
and to tie this in so what we gave these

302
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:05,318
animals would be the equivalent of a 75

303
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:09,519
kilo adult consuming 29 grams of pure

304
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:12,818
THC orally and only getting a mild no no

305
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,379
not something so because of this window

306
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:16,208
of where we're going to be dosing and

307
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:19,778
the fact that there's such low

308
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:22,748
absorbance really it's it's impressive

309
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:26,189
how how little this gets absorbed and

310
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:28,659
how much it stays targeted into the

311
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,880
we've also done pharmacology work that

312
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:32,588
shows that the pro drug vbx 100 no

313
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,070
longer binds to the cannabinoid

314
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:39,899
receptors or transporters like THC and

315
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:44,920
so really it requires the site-directed

316
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:46,269
hydrolysis in the large intestine I'm

317
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,740
running out of time so I'm going to kind

318
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,208
of gloss over a mechanism of action

319
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,049
because Ethan kind of talked on this but

320
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:55,299
tnf-alpha this inflammatory cytokine has

321
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:57,879
been shown to be decreased in

322
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:00,009
endocannabinoid treatment or cannabinoid

323
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,838
treatment and there's also this novel

324
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:04,899
mechanism of action it's kind of recent

325
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,870
and that's a a jak suppressor of

326
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:11,769
cytokine signaling 3 induced decrease or

327
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,639
inhibition of jak here and so I point

328
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,860
these out because these are both

329
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,990
blockbuster classes of drugs and so it's

330
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,139
intriguing that cannabinoids can have an

331
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,000
impact on these two classes there's also

332
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:24,028
more recent information coming out of

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,720
bethe McCormick's lab at UMass

334
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:29,049
supporting that an endocannabinoid

335
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,209
feedback system is sort of decreasing

336
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:32,769
this pro-inflammatory eicosanoids

337
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,939
pathway but i don't have time so come

338
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,500
grab me if you want to talk about this

339
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,600
later

340
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,220
so just in summary we've made novel

341
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,070
cannabinoid collect aside Pro drugs of

342
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,810
THC they're targeted exquisitely to the

343
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,970
large intestine we've demonstrated

344
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:49,659
efficacy in an animal model that's

345
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:52,350
accepted and we have decreased binding

346
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:54,909
to the receptors transporters versus THC

347
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,550
we're avoiding psychoactivity because

348
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:58,809
we're not even getting to the brain

349
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:01,149
through this targeted delivery to the

350
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:06,819
gut and we have local anti-inflammatory

351
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:09,909
action in the large intestine so we we

352
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,350
envision that both THC and VB x100

353
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,889
playing a prominent role in treatment

354
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,089
for IBD in the future mostly we're

355
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:18,490
focused and interested in like

356
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:22,540
decreasing the need for stereo steroids

357
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:24,430
and opioids three minutes thank you

358
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:25,899
and all of this with no psycho activity

359
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:27,479
and we haven't and there's no adverse

360
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:32,049
systemic like this isn't with

361
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,430
immunosuppressive action or the systemic

362
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:36,019
immunosuppressive action that's like

363
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:38,989
standard the TNF alpha inhibitors

364
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:41,179
so in very quickly just to point out so

365
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,129
we have a number of compounds that we

366
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:45,620
have intellectual property on as well as

367
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:47,200
so we're focused on vbx 100 which is

368
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,700
what I just talked to you today about

369
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,050
and our main indication is all sort of

370
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,379
colitis

371
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:56,479
but Clostridium so we also have data if

372
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:59,750
we have data on both antimicrobial

373
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,159
activity and biocidal activity for

374
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,460
cannabinoids versus Clostridium

375
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:06,589
difficile so we see a Avenue of use for

376
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,340
these infections of the gut

377
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:14,240
IBS as well as well as an opioid induced

378
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:16,460
narcotic bowel syndrome so I'm excited

379
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,950
to announce that we've received funding

380
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,800
that will enable us to start to phase 2

381
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:25,730
clinical trials on IBD and IBS in 2019

382
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:27,319
so we have exciting times ahead and with

383
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,940
that I'll wrap it up and say thank you

384
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,070
so much for the opportunity to talk and

385
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:37,310
thank you to my team for and everyone at

386
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:39,680
vitality I've got one quick question the

387
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:41,359
microbial hydrolysis of these is it is

388
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,929
it clean as a JIT what's left on the

389
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,659
resorcinol

390
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:48,559
modi after the mine it it reverts back

391
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:53,269
to THC so there's a complete removal of

392
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:57,049
the carbohydrates so hi thanks for the

393
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:58,399
talk dr. justo may be able to comment on

394
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,889
this as well but there have been several

395
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,190
studies we've done by GW Pharmaceuticals

396
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:06,049
using the one-to-one sativex

397
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,350
for multiple sclerosis and neuropathic

398
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:11,809
pain and the dropout rate is far far far

399
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:14,329
lower and I believe it's probably

400
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:17,179
because they start with one minute have

401
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:19,879
milligrams and go up very slowly was

402
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:23,120
with these patients start on 2300 grams

403
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,339
of THC the first day that's no it was

404
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:29,269
escalated to that so that was the upper

405
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:30,710
the upper end of the trial and so once

406
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:33,379
the patients encounter that dizziness

407
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,240
and psycho activity they stuck with it

408
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,360
but they stopped taking what they were

409
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,069
supposed to so you know if the botanical

410
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,240
extract was you know supposed to be a

411
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:42,889
certain amount they're just taking half

412
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,259
of it whatever made them feel good and

413
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:47,259
had gave them symptomatic relief so

414
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:55,359
you
