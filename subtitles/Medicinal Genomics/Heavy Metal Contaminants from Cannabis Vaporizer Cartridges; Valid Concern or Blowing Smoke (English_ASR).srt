1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,250
good morning everyone and thanks for

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,230
coming to can med 2019 my name's Kyle

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,879
Boyer I am the vice chair of the

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,980
American Chemical Society's cannabis

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,599
chemistry subdivision and today we're

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,548
going to be talking about heavy metal

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,800
contaminants and vaporizer cartridges I

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,300
know vape cartridges have really been in

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,528
the news lately

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,750
we're not exactly going to be tackling

11
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:23,640
the cutting agents and diluents but

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,859
nevertheless this is a really important

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,199
topic that I think we need to explore I

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,109
did do this work with any ophea who's

15
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,309
here in the crowd with can a safe and so

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,440
I want to thank them for being so

17
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,000
gracious and letting me invade their lab

18
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,649
over the weekends and we also did this

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,689
in collaboration with Robert Altman who

20
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,520
is a doctoral student getting his PhD in

21
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,878
public health

22
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,930
so with that I'll dive in firstly do you

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,789
want to give some disclaimers and

24
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,439
disclosures of course any as a principal

25
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,179
at Kansas State Analytics which is a

26
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,759
compliance testing laboratory here in

27
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,710
Los Angeles California and one thing I

28
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,929
do really want to stress about this work

29
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,239
is that it is done with very limited

30
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,878
sample sizes this is a pilot study and

31
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,408
it's ongoing so really by no measure

32
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,390
should we be taking the data that's

33
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,439
presented here and ultimately drawing

34
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,250
final conclusions on the subject so how

35
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,379
did it all start

36
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,500
well phase 3 compliance testing kick in

37
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:19,109
on January 1st 2019 here in California

38
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,819
and that basically mandated that we had

39
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,618
to test for the big four heavy metals so

40
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,789
that is arsenic cadmium lead mercury and

41
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:28,500
basically here are the different action

42
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,000
levels that you see for all the

43
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,180
different product types of course you'll

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,069
notice for the inhaled Goods this is on

45
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,659
the lower end of things we're

46
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,459
particularly gonna be focusing in on

47
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,890
lead today because that is what we're

48
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:45,030
really seeing out there as a problem in

49
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,009
the field so again it started with this

50
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,989
compliance need for people so they

51
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,688
started to these vape part manufacturers

52
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,819
started to test their cartridges prior

53
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:55,798
to this compliance this new phase of

54
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,269
compliance kicking in and what the VAP

55
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,618
part manufacturers we're seeing across

56
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:59,879
the board is most of them we're not

57
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,280
meeting the mark and they were failing

58
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,798
and we saw a lot of different headlines

59
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,750
that were very concerning things like

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,099
lab testing reveals like there's lead in

61
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,889
the there's lead in most paper

62
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,959
cartridges and also things like it is

63
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,589
worse than reported so people were

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,209
really concerned

65
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,409
about this especially the cart

66
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,739
manufacturers who couldn't get their

67
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:22,079
products on the shelf and when we

68
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,060
actually asked around for COAS for some

69
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,890
of these things we saw a ton of

70
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,348
different results all across the board

71
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:30,419
so you can notice on the lower end on

72
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,459
some of these led it 25 parts per

73
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,809
million but you could see almost eleven

74
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,750
thousand parts per million in some of

75
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,650
these so there's a big question here and

76
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,878
that is well is there a big variance and

77
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,680
spread that we're seeing across these

78
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,268
different cart manufacturers and then we

79
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,500
also gotta ask the question about who is

80
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,250
doing the testing and how are they doing

81
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,049
it right

82
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,539
currently we don't have any reference

83
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,280
methods to draw upon to actually

84
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,810
standardize the testing of these

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,400
vaporizer cartridges so some questions

86
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,229
that come to mind is how are you doing

87
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,730
the digestion of these de partridges are

88
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:01,738
you simply taking the whole cart and

89
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:03,419
running it through digestion fluid and

90
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,299
then analyzing are you letting your

91
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,348
digestion fluids soak in on the carts

92
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,780
and the parts where it's actually having

93
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:12,389
a contact without knowing what people

94
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,068
are doing really all these results don't

95
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,719
have any strong meaning because we can't

96
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:18,328
compare to one another really because

97
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,969
everyone's doing something different so

98
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,769
this also propagated even further across

99
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,689
social media and that's what really

100
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,639
drove our attention is how scared people

101
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:27,840
were about this of course the cart

102
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,950
manufacturers but also the people who

103
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
are interested in public health and

104
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:33,060
understanding our my tape cartridges

105
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,170
safe for consumption I do want to give

106
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,259
the shout out to a couple different

107
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,309
groups that really helped spur this work

108
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:40,530
California City and County regulation

109
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,449
watch was really great because it

110
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,560
allowed for real-time interaction with

111
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:45,598
those in the community who were dealing

112
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,680
with it on the front lines people whose

113
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,659
fingers are on the pulse and they're

114
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,430
constantly posting and letting us know

115
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,959
what's going on out there and then also

116
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,340
cannabis science and chemistry I'm a

117
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,689
moderator for that group on Facebook

118
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,129
there's a lot of great scientific

119
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,829
discourse that's happening online

120
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,389
it's not your traditional forum for

121
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,650
scientific discussion but a lot of

122
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,069
really bright folks in there that are

123
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,319
bringing from these topics to light so

124
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:09,839
well not currently engage in cannabis

125
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:10,348
regulation the FDA does deal with pre

126
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,139
market

127
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:14,638
tobacco products and different nicotine

128
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,590
delivery systems and you'll notice that

129
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,060
there's an overlap in some of the things

130
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,038
that we are testing for for these so of

131
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,168
course the big four cadmium and lead

132
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:23,550
would be a part of that but also they're

133
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:25,019
testing for things like chromium and

134
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,699
nickel as well as some of the heating

135
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,689
elements associated with nicotine

136
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,599
devices all

137
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,980
so have these involved and then also for

138
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,410
these devices necessary to connect

139
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,090
analysis of the liquids and aerosols in

140
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,860
your product due to the substances

141
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,949
outlined here that are potentially

142
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,720
harmful constituents and many of these

143
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:46,349
are produced in response to the actual

144
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,210
vaping process so we had some questions

145
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,680
to answer in this study and that is the

146
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:52,019
storing the cannabinoids containing

147
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,670
solutions that we developed it lead to

148
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:55,740
appreciable levels of the big four heavy

149
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,240
metals in there and then if the metals

150
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,490
are indeed leaching into the extract can

151
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,079
we quantify that ratio of the big four

152
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,819
heavy metals in the previous art RZA's

153
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,229
to the post vape cartridges and then

154
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,480
also the condensed material from that

155
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,670
vaporization process and then how does

156
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,660
the storage time as well and the

157
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,280
residence time inside of these

158
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,650
cartridges affect the amount of leaching

159
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,149
that occurs during vaporization and then

160
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:16,829
we also wanted to know how did the

161
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,239
chemical constituents of these different

162
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:21,149
solutions affect the leaching of heavy

163
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,819
metals so to actually answer these

164
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:25,679
questions we source a number of

165
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:27,329
suspected contaminated cartridges out

166
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,730
there from a few different manufacturers

167
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:31,829
and then we filled them with realistic

168
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,020
extract solutions containing THC and CBD

169
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:35,729
distillates terpenes and various

170
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,319
different cutting agents and then we

171
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,540
also ran these through a smoking machine

172
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,099
and we captured the condensate in order

173
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,990
to test the concentrations of the metals

174
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,020
that could potentially carry over into

175
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,579
the end-users lungs so here are some of

176
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,049
the different cutting agents and

177
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:52,109
diluents that you see on the market so

178
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,430
on the Left we've got PG VG Pegg I'm

179
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,680
sure many of you have heard of these in

180
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,480
the news in particular we have the alpha

181
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,189
tocopherol and the Scott for a last day

182
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,509
I think to call for last day is we're

183
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,009
really concerned about the alpha

184
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,930
tocopheryl someone does have a patent on

185
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,879
it has been used safely to my knowledge

186
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,100
out there but then you've also got

187
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,050
things like viscosity by true terpenes

188
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,150
and thickener by flora plex these are

189
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,949
cutting agents and diluents that don't

190
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:15,299
even have ingredients listed and I think

191
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,889
that's certainly going to change here

192
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,300
especially in light of the recent events

193
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,819
with all the vaping illness that has

194
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,860
been happening and then what we did use

195
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,629
in the study was two different things

196
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,610
so we chose to use medium chain

197
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,168
triglycerides or MCT oil this is what

198
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,790
you commonly see in health food stores

199
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:31,139
things like whole foods people make the

200
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,819
bulletproof coffee with it but it's also

201
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,279
one of the most common cutting agents on

202
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,050
the black market currently and then also

203
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,639
we we sourced some Czech temper from

204
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,919
abstracts again this is another one with

205
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,399
proprietary components but some friends

206
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:42,810
in the vaping

207
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,189
three we're telling me that this is

208
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,569
what's commonly used as a cutting agent

209
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:47,759
for some of these CVD pens because

210
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,250
they're actually not miscible at higher

211
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,030
concentrations than the MCT so for the

212
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,459
CVD cards we used that as well I also

213
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:57,869
made a terpene blown we didn't get to do

214
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,359
enough of these terpene blends this is

215
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,918
just one of them I made I source Center

216
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,439
pians from Tudor pians and flora Plex

217
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,508
and I essentially copied this

218
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,860
formulation that they had online why did

219
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,120
we choose this one in particular no

220
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,500
particular reason I just really liked

221
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,439
your PIN lane it's my favorite terpene

222
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,449
so but essentially it's mostly true

223
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,689
pedaling with a bunch of other minor

224
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:20,520
components as well so how did we

225
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:23,610
actually make the smoking machine so

226
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,099
this is we didn't have any funding so

227
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,360
this was sort of just a fun project that

228
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,650
we just decided to investigate further

229
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,139
because we were curious about answering

230
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:34,138
these questions and luckily Robert who I

231
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,550
collaborated was very handy with with

232
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,569
basically making something like this so

233
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,150
we found something in the literature

234
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:40,829
that would would enable us to do this

235
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:43,049
and we tried to copy it as best we could

236
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:45,359
so he took a modified aquarium pump and

237
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,610
basically flipped the solenoid on it and

238
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,410
then we took an Arduino which allows us

239
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,810
to program the pump that we use so that

240
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,760
it would do exactly what we wanted to at

241
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,680
the given time points and then we took a

242
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,139
Y connector adapter and place it into an

243
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,209
Eppendorf tube and we parafilm that shut

244
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,500
and then fixed all of this together with

245
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,329
a bunch of different tubing different

246
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,038
varieties of tubing and then we fix this

247
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:07,439
all to a vape battery with a cartridge

248
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,918
attached to it and so that is a photo

249
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,538
there of the actual setup itself and so

250
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,788
here's the smoking machine protocol that

251
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,860
we that we developed so we programmed

252
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:18,810
the pump to automatically inhale for 12

253
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,970
seconds with 30 seconds of downtime in

254
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,709
between the puffs the battery had an

255
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,510
automatic off function after 10 seconds

256
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,250
so we already know that each puff was 10

257
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,079
seconds that last 2 seconds was used to

258
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,689
clear any residual vapor that was left

259
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,250
in the tubes and then we recovered and

260
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,450
spun down any remaining oil that was

261
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,370
found at the cartridge after the

262
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,750
vaporization and then we also collected

263
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,979
the condensate and then we analyzed all

264
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,788
of these according to Kansas State

265
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,680
assistive p4 heavy metals analysis so of

266
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,730
course before we test anything we want

267
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,169
to make sure that everything that we're

268
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,370
putting into these carts is clean to

269
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:49,649
begin with it's not going to impact the

270
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,089
results so here are all the different

271
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:54,120
things we source to put in here so we

272
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,750
have THC and CBD distillate the MCT the

273
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,860
the Durban

274
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,279
boys and Terps and Tec temper and you

275
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,960
can see here that be the highest amounts

276
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,250
were found in the TEC temper and the THC

277
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,780
distillate but ultimately these are

278
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,840
still just at point one part per million

279
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,220
so really we shouldn't see anything much

280
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,009
above that in any of the resulting

281
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,320
formulations so here is the actual

282
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:19,679
sample prep an icp-ms method that we ran

283
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,390
so digestion fairly standard we took our

284
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,549
sample and we place it in a digestion

285
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:25,409
vessel at four mils of nitric acid and

286
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:27,209
then one middle of hydrochloric acid and

287
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:30,449
then we digested this in a milestone

288
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,490
ultra-wave at 250 C and 120 bar and as

289
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,110
far as the actual method goes we were

290
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,320
calibrated for all four analytes across

291
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,450
0 to 50 ppb five point calibration and

292
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,850
then for our different LEDs and lo2 use

293
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,440
those are all listed there so between 2

294
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,480
and 30 ppb depending on the analyte

295
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,270
we're talking about and then as far as

296
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,070
the acceptance criteria the BCC does

297
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,139
have these different acceptable ranges

298
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,760
of Recovery's that you should have for

299
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,710
things like your CCD is to ensure the

300
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,939
instrument is functioning properly so in

301
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,200
agent one twenty percent is that

302
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,670
acceptable range and of course your

303
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,080
r-squared should look good as well and

304
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:05,699
be greater than point nine nine so for

305
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,220
our pilot data what we did is we sourced

306
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,230
some cartridges from a California

307
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,389
manufacturer that this had already

308
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,610
basically failed for compliance testing

309
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:16,169
and they were in quarantine so by the

310
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,789
time we got this stuff it would already

311
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:20,189
been sitting in the cartridge for six

312
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:22,110
months and we'd already known that it

313
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,400
failed compliance so we had some inkling

314
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,009
that there was definitely gonna be some

315
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,019
metals in there and as you can see here

316
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:29,429
over three times the action level for

317
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,409
lead was found in this particular

318
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,329
cartridge we also ran it through the

319
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:35,459
smoking machine and we were able to

320
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,770
recover very close to the action level

321
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,120
of lead which essentially represents

322
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,129
what would end up in the end-users lungs

323
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,419
so that came out at about 480 parts per

324
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:48,330
billion so the one month post filling

325
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,919
data so here are the different parts

326
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,080
that we tested and you'll notice here

327
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,969
that all in yellow all the different

328
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,350
cards that we tested not the condensate

329
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,850
but the actual part itself what was

330
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,560
remaining up to the vaping it all

331
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,420
contained near the California action

332
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,129
levels and what was really interesting

333
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,289
is for our most interesting data point

334
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:06,000
we had one in particular that exceeded

335
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:08,189
the California levels by thirteen times

336
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,139
unfortunately for that

337
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,580
data point we weren't able to actually

338
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,799
collect enough condensate we aren't

339
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,940
exactly sure what happened but for that

340
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,469
particular one we removed from our

341
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,660
statistical analysis just because it was

342
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,639
such a big outlier and we really don't

343
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:22,740
know if that particular cart just

344
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,019
happened to be more contaminated than

345
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,259
others and these things are manufactured

346
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,360
in China with not a lot of oversight so

347
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:34,259
the homogeneity between Clark decart may

348
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,879
not be all there so as far as our

349
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,100
statistical analysis goes we we did a

350
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,850
t-test to compare the different sample

351
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,639
means

352
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,529
so we basically did see statistically

353
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,970
significant differences for most

354
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,069
comparisons with the exception of

355
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,259
cadmium and then we also conducted a

356
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,150
paired t-test for the condensate versus

357
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,830
the remaining oil and we did see a

358
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:54,509
statistically significant difference for

359
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:58,379
all of different analytes that we tested

360
00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:00,899
for and then as far as the means go

361
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:03,259
in our previous ting we did show that

362
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:05,399
none of our starting materials contain

363
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:07,679
levels of heavy metals that approach any

364
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,569
of the action levels and then it's some

365
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,389
of our post paper experiments we saw

366
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,640
levels as high as 2 ppm and then we also

367
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:16,289
saw higher levels an oil that remained

368
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,509
in the cart compared to what was covered

369
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:20,879
recovered in the condensate by a factor

370
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:23,129
of about 2 and then when comparing all

371
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,990
of the post paper to the Prive per we

372
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:27,330
see an increase to by about a factor of

373
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,430
10 and then we would remove that outlier

374
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,230
data point we we see an increase of

375
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:36,269
about 2 of by a factor of about 2.5 so

376
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,120
as far as the two-month post filling

377
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:41,399
data ultimately what we did see was that

378
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,440
levels and all cartridges were on

379
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,909
average higher for the two month data

380
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,180
point in comparison to that one month

381
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:50,610
data point so you can see here all these

382
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,769
different results suggest that we're

383
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,659
definitely over the action level this

384
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:56,639
one did not these two did not in

385
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:59,100
particular that are not bolded but and

386
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,019
ultimately in all of the end products we

387
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,540
did see or not all the end products half

388
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,299
the end products we did see that we

389
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:09,689
exceed the action level for at least two

390
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:11,729
out of the four but ultimately all the

391
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,230
products contained about a two to eight

392
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,240
fold increase in the amounts of lead

393
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:19,649
after about two months of sitting in

394
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,690
these cartridges but I do want to give

395
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,889
some context from

396
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,650
at these different data points that

397
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:28,019
we're collecting so let's consider the

398
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:30,600
2008 ambient air quality standard for

399
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,210
led so that's at exposure about 0.15

400
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,700
micrograms per cubic meter and that

401
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:39,180
would amount to a dose of about 2.4

402
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,970
micrograms over time and if you wanted

403
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,519
to actually get to those same levels you

404
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,860
would actually have to vape almost 5 of

405
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,269
these full gram cartridges in order to

406
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,450
exceed achieve that same level of

407
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:55,049
exposure and then also in the context of

408
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:57,240
OSHA the permissible exposure action

409
00:13:55,049 --> 00:14:00,169
level is about 30 micrograms per cubic

410
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,169
meter so you should you get about a mean

411
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:07,169
exposure of 160 micrograms and basically

412
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:09,240
you would have to smoke 320 cartridges

413
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:11,939
in a single day in order to hit that

414
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,659
level now I think we can all agree that

415
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,100
no level of lead is good right but we do

416
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,409
want to give some context these numbers

417
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,870
just because we don't want to raise the

418
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:24,569
alarm specifically if it's not something

419
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,810
that is really overly concerning in a

420
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,760
capacity like this ultimately if you

421
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:32,159
were at the exper miscible exposure

422
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,080
limit for OSHA you would have to smoke 5

423
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,419
over 500 of these cartridges in an

424
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,290
8-hour shift so I think that would put

425
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:42,209
undergraduate Kyle to shame for sure so

426
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:44,159
we did have some limitations in the

427
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,810
study this is again pilot data this is

428
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,159
by no means perfect but we did want to

429
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,029
get some Inklings as to what's going on

430
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,980
here

431
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:51,480
so there's definitely a potential for

432
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,830
inter lot variability between the

433
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,840
different brands the cartridges that we

434
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,340
tested again China doesn't have the best

435
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,129
oversight on some of these manufacturing

436
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,450
processes so you could potentially see

437
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:02,220
one cart that has much more

438
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,290
contamination than another even if they

439
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,910
came from the same law and then there's

440
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:07,199
also quite a bit of variability and the

441
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:10,559
different types of carts that you see

442
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,790
out there so we we tried to do the best

443
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,549
we could to mimic what is out there on

444
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:16,409
the market but you could see anywhere

445
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,939
both things with like tons of vitamin E

446
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:19,559
acetate I mean we didn't use that as a

447
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,540
representation but that is out there in

448
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,799
the marketplace so we can't take every

449
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:24,419
single cartridge and make something

450
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,609
that's realistic but we can do the best

451
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:29,370
that we can we did have a lack of

452
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,529
replicate samples again we sourced all

453
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,850
these parts from just different sources

454
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,730
from the Internet and friends of ours

455
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,110
that are in the industry so

456
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,120
didn't have a whole lot of these so we

457
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,519
weren't able to do replicates but that

458
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,649
would certainly help in future work and

459
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,990
then also realistic vaping right the

460
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:47,120
smoking machine itself is not meant to

461
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,089
actually represent the puff topography

462
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,560
of what is normally done we try to take

463
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:53,480
a best representation but of course

464
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,549
nobody is always hitting a vape in

465
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,409
exactly for 10 seconds waiting 30

466
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:59,750
seconds for downtime and then continuing

467
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:01,278
to pop off so most people also don't

468
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,879
smoke a whole carton in a single setting

469
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,620
right and then also the differences in

470
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,139
vaporizer battery settings out there are

471
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,639
very wide so what we did in this

472
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:12,440
particular study was we use an

473
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,399
e-cigarette battery that would basically

474
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,750
sense the voltage and resistance that is

475
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,519
that is meant for that particular cart

476
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,470
type so we knew that we were gonna be

477
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,649
cooking this stuff but ultimately again

478
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,820
this is just one setting and there are

479
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,708
many different settings that you find

480
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,410
out there we only used one standard

481
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,909
power rating of 7.4 watts so at least we

482
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:34,059
could get some consistency across the

483
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:36,289
different samples that we had tested

484
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,689
some future questions for this work that

485
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:40,849
we have so the speciation of heavy

486
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,290
metals is important are these metals

487
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,300
that we're seeing there in the inorganic

488
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:46,068
or the inorganic the organic or

489
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:48,289
inorganic form because that's really

490
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:50,778
going to play a factor into how bad this

491
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:52,189
could be for human health for a future

492
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:54,049
work we also need a larger sample sizes

493
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,360
we can't just use a limited sample size

494
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:57,979
and draw conclusions we don't like to

495
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,440
see some interlocked variation testing

496
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,870
just to see if there is consistency in

497
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,939
the manufacturing of these and then we

498
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,318
would be good to also see some different

499
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:07,939
terpene formulations like I said we

500
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,828
chose two pending dominant simply

501
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,808
because that's the the terpene of choice

502
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,188
for me but it would be great to see some

503
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:14,359
of these other turbines especially I

504
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,400
think turkey and alcohols would be

505
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:18,109
interesting to see because terpenes of

506
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,298
course our solvents and that could

507
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,159
certainly impact the leaching of some of

508
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:25,279
these different components into the

509
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,048
extract itself and then we also want to

510
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,308
know do other heavy metals leach aside

511
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:29,779
from the big four of course we're

512
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,950
focused on the big four in California

513
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:33,048
because that's what's mandated to be

514
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,000
tested for but do we see anything else

515
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:36,319
like nickel or chromium and things like

516
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,470
that as well because those could also

517
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,269
absent some health challenges and we

518
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,829
also want to test more cartridges and

519
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:45,650
formulations sitting in these things

520
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:47,899
after a longer length of time what I

521
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,040
think is interesting in particular

522
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,420
with our two-month data point in

523
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,000
particular is that we actually saw a

524
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,170
flipping that happened where we saw more

525
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,940
of this stuff ending up in the

526
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,130
condensate in particular than the actual

527
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,720
cart so that's suggest to me I was

528
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,100
actually discussing with dr. Rogan about

529
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,990
this earlier that suggests to me that

530
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:05,119
well if these things are sitting in the

531
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,200
cartridge the actual coil itself

532
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,179
everything is breaking down right

533
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,090
because again terpenes are solvents so

534
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,310
these cutting agents may be aiding in

535
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:16,490
the breakdown of the metal coil that is

536
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:18,609
inside of these things so it's

537
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,990
interesting to see and we were curious

538
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:22,250
test more sample so we can get a better

539
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:26,150
understanding of what exactly is

540
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,799
happening here so in conclusion we were

541
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,540
able to show that a low-cost modified

542
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,159
air sampling pump was able to produce

543
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:32,960
constitute the condensate that we

544
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,930
collected in mp Dorf tube for analysis

545
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,329
for heavy metals and we did recover

546
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,400
we recovered remaining solutions and

547
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:41,960
basically were we weren't able to see

548
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,730
that there were elevated concentrations

549
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,340
of heavy metals and here compared to the

550
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,039
starting materials and then even without

551
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:50,839
vaping we still saw that many of these

552
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,710
cartridges two out of four still

553
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,939
exceeded the action level for lead so

554
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,190
ultimately we still need to do more work

555
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,380
on this is still very early but

556
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,269
hopefully this paves the way as a cheap

557
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,830
and easy way to do this type of analysis

558
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:06,710
so that we can ensure that consumers are

559
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:08,809
safe with that want to thank you all for

560
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:18,110
your time and I'm hoping to answer any

561
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:20,539
questions all right Thank You mr. Boyer

562
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:23,479
that was a great presentation timely and

563
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,349
valuable data two questions one of them

564
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,569
might be a little silly

565
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:28,909
the first one is did you notice any

566
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:30,919
organoleptic visual or quality

567
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,509
differences with the oils that you could

568
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,279
kind of see with just your senses that

569
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:36,829
might tip off that they were heavy and

570
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:39,200
metals and color consistency something

571
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:41,210
like that as far as the oils that went

572
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,920
in no because remember we tested all

573
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,410
these things prior to be getting any any

574
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,420
work so we knew right off the bat that

575
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,730
the highest levels we would see we're

576
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,100
0.1 ppm and that would be if we had just

577
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,950
used pure distillate or the pure Tec

578
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:58,009
temper and the second one is is have you

579
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,110
have plans to do spiking and recovery

580
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:01,150
data I think

581
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:03,369
helped to validate your experimental

582
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,230
model and maybe you know more people

583
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,178
might use it seriously you know take

584
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,250
heavy metal spike it into samples and

585
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:11,290
measure that recovery data oh certainly

586
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,460
like I said this is a pilot study it

587
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:13,869
would be great to actually do some

588
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,220
further validation on this method to

589
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:17,289
show that we can actually indeed recover

590
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,120
all this stuff I think that would give

591
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:20,529
researchers a lot more confidence to use

592
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,889
this method and move forward with it as

593
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:27,700
a way to do more analysis of this thank

594
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:31,450
you good work thank you hi Kyle Beth

595
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,669
Hayes I have a question about thinners

596
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,460
and whether some of the thinners might

597
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:38,710
carry more of the lead or break down the

598
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,400
metal and release some of the leads and

599
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,980
the other sinners so I actually think

600
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,450
based on the data that we saw more of it

601
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,740
is actually to do with the terpenes

602
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,110
themselves and the cutting agents

603
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,019
although those with just cutting agents

604
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:53,979
and no turbines still exhibited a

605
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:57,129
significant amount of leaching than it

606
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,380
occurred so I would say that we did see

607
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,150
higher higher levels in the condensate

608
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,280
for those with terpenes in particular

609
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,750
so again terpenes being solvents I think

610
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,910
those are the main contributors but

611
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,410
there's certainly complex chemistry

612
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,169
going on here and based on the data that

613
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,160
we have we can't actually isolate which

614
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,140
of these is going to be the greater

615
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,850
contributors do you were there any

616
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,440
terpenes that were worse or you just

617
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,209
tested the same terpenes on all we

618
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,950
tested only one terpene formulation and

619
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,390
that was at repentantly in dominant it

620
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,620
would be great to see more work with

621
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,929
things like turkey and alcohols because

622
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:27,879
I think those could certainly lead to

623
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:30,009
more leaching in particular yes please

624
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,450
do that yeah it's coming it's in the

625
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:37,000
works I'm kind of piggybacking on what

626
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,740
she said but in addition to the terpenes

627
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,509
the other additives you know you should

628
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,150
FCT and oil and all these other things

629
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:44,829
is there any way to test so the patients

630
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,780
know that or the consumer knows that

631
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:48,009
this is going to be clean like it are

632
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:50,619
you gonna get led for many of those

633
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:53,829
other things potentially lead is

634
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:57,369
everywhere let you know low levels can

635
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:59,678
be everywhere so ultimately I think it's

636
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,759
best for all manufacturers whatever

637
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,710
they're putting in their products that

638
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,690
they should be testing all the materials

639
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,919
not just the final product just to know

640
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,900
where these sources of contamination

641
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,540
could be coming from because like I said

642
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,240
let is everywhere so you really have to

643
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,558
know your source and ensure that

644
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,190
it's going into a product for

645
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:20,339
consumption has been tested prior so for

646
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,710
California regulations is the company

647
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,269
required to test the cartridge with all

648
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,970
of these things and they all must passed

649
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:28,980
or is it just the THC and CBD that has

650
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,650
to pass the test it is just the final

651
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,269
product in PCs for BCC regulations here

652
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,830
in California the final product has to

653
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,029
be tested not the constituents going

654
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:38,699
into it but of course some of the more

655
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:40,980
responsible manufacturers may be testing

656
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,990
some of the different components prior

657
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,819
to it so that they have some indication

658
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,920
of what they should see in their end

659
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:48,450
product so if there was major light

660
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,009
contamination in the cartridge from

661
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,750
something else that was added a turkey

662
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:54,390
nor another additive that would be

663
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,819
showing up in these tests again this is

664
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,500
not mandated for these faults but I

665
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:00,480
think the more responsible cart

666
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,799
manufacturers and producers will be

667
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,579
doing this type of testing to ensure

668
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:07,319
that consumers are safe thank you I have

669
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:08,490
a question that kind of follows up what

670
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,379
you were saying that you were talking a

671
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,839
lot about you know the cartridges are

672
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,270
being made in China mostly that there's

673
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,519
not a lot of quality control and it

674
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:20,009
seems to be influencing the leachate

675
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,900
obviously and it I mean I'm guessing

676
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:23,670
that most of that is coming from the

677
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,259
heating mechanism is this true or is it

678
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,450
also coming from other parts of the

679
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,160
cartridges there and have you compared

680
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,880
that to glass cartridges versus plastic

681
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,710
I mean how far have we been able to get

682
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,210
that information we haven't been able to

683
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,039
test like specific parts of the

684
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,690
cartridges this is just looking at the

685
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,250
whole cartridges themselves and

686
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,960
ultimately what's going to cause

687
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,660
leaching I think is what the actual

688
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,920
solution is in contact with right so but

689
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,509
I think it would be great to actually

690
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,308
dissect some of these cartridges you can

691
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:51,929
see some of the folks who did their

692
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:53,759
testing prior to January 1 we're

693
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:55,320
actually disassembling at the different

694
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,789
pieces of the vape cartridges to

695
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:58,889
understand where the contamination was

696
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:00,149
coming from in the cart but this

697
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,860
particular work did not focus on that

698
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,809
but I think future work should take a

699
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:06,359
look at that as well and it's not

700
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:08,279
actually the fact that the solution is

701
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:10,558
just sitting it's that sitting in a

702
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,058
cartridge correct yes exactly in contact

703
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,529
with the components that do have the

704
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:18,149
heavy metal contamination which leads to

705
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:20,940
this ultimately Jake thank you in your

706
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,040
view is there an excipient or doing that

707
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,509
might be better or I don't know if I

708
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,798
want to use the word safer to use in

709
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:28,589
these products like peach

710
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:31,618
Viji versus MCT oil versus a long-chain

711
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:33,388
fatty acids or think ultimately I don't

712
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:35,638
think we have enough data to make any

713
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,469
conclusive statements about what is safe

714
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:38,758
in terms of these different cutting

715
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,470
agents and again a lot of these things

716
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,960
don't even have ingredients list so how

717
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,159
can you determine that if you know these

718
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,710
things aren't met readily made available

719
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,299
to the public so I think that more work

720
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:54,659
needs to be done to establish what kind

721
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:58,809
of cutting agents are actually safe any

722
00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:03,890
other questions thank you

723
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:03,889
