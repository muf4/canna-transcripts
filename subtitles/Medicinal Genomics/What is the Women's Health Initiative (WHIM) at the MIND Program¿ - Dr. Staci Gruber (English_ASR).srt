[Music]

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,118
um I did want to ask you about um the

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,439
Women's Health Initiative at mind uh

4
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,079
it's mentioned in your abstract as

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,960
something that you guys are looking into

6
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,719
or sort of expanding into um so please

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,560
share about that and sort of what what

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,399
conditions you're looking at there yeah

9
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,839
whim or the Women's Health Initiative at

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,439
mine I just wanted something that was

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,480
catchy where I could say not just a whim

12
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:41,479
um so you know over a billion you're

13
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:44,398
always with the puns I try I really try

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:46,718
um over a billion individuals are

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,960
affected by things like gynecologic pain

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,920
in this country it's largely

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,160
understudied this is an underserved

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,920
population for a million different

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:01:00,198
reasons and there are lots of reasons to

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,120
explore the potential application of can

21
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,319
cannaboids in these conditions for

22
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:07,640
example we did a number of survey based

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,919
studies these were my first real survey

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,478
based studies I had done a little bit of

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,719
work in this area before but it come in

26
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:16,478
with um per menopausal menopausal and

27
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,719
postmenopausal disruption and things

28
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,519
like um cannabis or cannaboids we did a

29
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:25,920
survey study that was a bit of an

30
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:27,399
adjacent clinical um uh investigation

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,240
individuals who are using a commercially

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,640
available vaginal suppository for uh

33
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,560
menstrual related dysfunction and we now

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,399
have our very first uh project that's

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,680
funded to look at women with

36
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,799
endometriosis using a whole plant full

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,159
spectrum product that I made for folks

38
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,399
with endometriosis and related pain so

39
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,479
there's a lot of interest here and

40
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,920
people are using these products the

41
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:52,798
problem that I often hear about is

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,600
patients will tell you you know I don't

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,439
know my friend used this so I figured

44
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,519
I'll just try well wouldn't it be great

45
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:00,718
to actually have data that could help

46
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,280
individuals be informed about what

47
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,679
products they should and maybe shouldn't

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,879
be exploring I don't know just a thought

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,439
um so that's that's I think a a rather

50
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,840
exciting area again endometriosis is is

51
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,878
one of those conditions that so many are

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,080
affected by so many are affected by yeah

53
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,639
and the number of symptoms is rather

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
staggering when you really start looking

55
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,759
at the data and so if you can improve

56
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,159
the quality of life and you can reduce

57
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,079
discomfort and increase people's ability

58
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,840
to sleep and be less again either less

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,760
anxious or have less pain or all of the

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,319
above why wouldn't you

61
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,318
try no it's interesting you mentioned

62
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,039
endometriosis we did have a presenter

63
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:44,639
last year uh who talked about that and

64
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,280
it was sort of more exploratory of you

65
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,759
know could cannabinoids potentially be a

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
good treatment option um and it sounds

67
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,318
like now you're actually investigating

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
that so that's that's fantastic there's

69
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,199
every reason to think so given the

70
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,479
relationship between the endoc canono

71
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,799
system this endogenous system you know

72
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,719
chemical and receptors throughout the

73
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,680
brain and body and the and the

74
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,719
gynecologic system right so again when

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,159
we think of the ways that we're all sort

76
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:12,239
of wired why wouldn't you try to harness

77
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,519
the most powerful things that you could

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,360
that are potentially less invasive or

79
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,280
less quote disruptive to other things um

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
you know if it isn't likely to do a ton

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,400
of harm and could potentially help I'm

82
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:27,399
all for trying to see what what we get

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
excellent

84
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:41,438
