1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,039
good morning everyone thank you for

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,440
being here so early and thank you to can

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,558
Med for inviting me and to all the

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,718
sponsors this is the best Cannabis

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,719
Conference that I've been to in a long

6
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:21,660
time and more and more it's feeling like

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,919
a family of people working together in a

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,980
common mission

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,080
and and it's just beautiful so I'm I'm

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,420
so thankful this morning

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,619
last night I was talking with my friend

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,840
Nicole who thanked me for always making

13
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:39,539
her feel like she doesn't know anything

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,359
after my presentations

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:45,079
and my response was well actually I have

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,579
a whole presentation about that tomorrow

17
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,980
but I've never actually designed my

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,340
presentations to do that before but

19
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:55,319
apparently that's the intention today

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,719
so I want to show you something that

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,719
I've been thinking a lot about over the

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,340
last 13 years of clinical practice based

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,500
on the observations I've had in my

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,600
patients and things that I've found in

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,519
the primary literature and how we can

26
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,199
tie that all together to have a better

27
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,500
and deeper understanding of the

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,439
potential of cannabis we know that there

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,400
is a huge untapped potential in this

30
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:19,798
plant

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,359
and we just don't know exactly where to

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,000
look so I'm going to point you in a

33
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,280
certain direction and to do that we

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,219
might need to zoom in a little bit we

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,978
have a beautiful flower from my backyard

36
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,079
this first picture

37
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,060
and then as we zoom in it starts to look

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,280
a little different a little like a

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,200
fantasy world and as we get even closer

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,799
it starts to look a little bit like an

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,659
alien landscape and this is where I want

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,600
to take you today suddenly we went from

43
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,880
Cannabis land to mushroom land but um

44
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,679
but when you when you zoom in like this

45
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,099
and you get a deeper understanding of

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,799
what's happening in one small part of

47
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,000
the Cannabis world then I think we can

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,460
zoom out again with a better

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,259
appreciation for the whole so whenever

50
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,679
we zoom in during this presentation

51
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,840
today let's stick with the hole as well

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,260
we're going to talk about some cannabis

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,360
dosing Trends hormesis and its role in

54
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,019
medicine might be a new term for some of

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,780
you

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,099
pre-clinical evidence for low and ultra

57
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,900
low dosing

58
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,299
we'll talk about some of the potential

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,340
mechanisms of action and then I'll bring

60
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,840
the rubber to the road for some

61
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,080
recommendations for researchers

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,900
producers and patients

63
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,780
a lot of you have heard this phrase the

64
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,599
dose makes the poison which is a

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,500
paraphrase of a quote from paracelsus

66
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:45,619
who lived in the 14 and 1500s all things

67
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,680
are poison and nothing is without poison

68
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,539
only the dose allows something to not be

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,360
poison

70
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,919
and for the um AV guys in the back thank

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,900
you for doing such a good job could you

72
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,818
make my next slide a little bigger I

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,860
don't have notes on the PowerPoint so I

74
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:06,899
don't need that big thing there

75
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:09,720
so when we overdose on THC we tend to

76
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,000
see paradoxical effects you look at the

77
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,519
list of symptoms that can occur with an

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,639
overdose you'll see almost everything

79
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,158
that cannabis could cure or treat at an

80
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,318
appropriate dose nausea vomiting

81
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,039
diarrhea all these GI complaints anxiety

82
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:28,018
and paranoia it can cause headache

83
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,840
myoclonus hyperkinesis like needing to

84
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,539
move around and twitching and and

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,700
confusion and even psychosis now this

86
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,639
most commonly occurs when somebody eats

87
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,560
a delicious looking treat that has an

88
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,559
appetite stimulant in it that makes them

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,140
want to eat more or when the poor

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,939
patient receives a tube of dark stuff

91
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,279
from one of their friends

92
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,900
uh that really wants to help and tells

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,400
them to start with a half grain of rice

94
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,780
and they wake up in the middle of the

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,640
night in a acute psychosis not not fun

96
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,900
and and sorry guys in the back I don't

97
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,699
know if I

98
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,319
um you know misspoke but now I've got

99
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,759
the same thing on both sides I'd love to

100
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,500
have one of what I'm talking about and

101
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,959
one of what's coming next if you can

102
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,900
swing that so if you look in my clinical

103
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,640
practice at the oral dosing range that's

104
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,220
been effective and this includes some

105
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,459
outliers we could go all the way down to

106
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,320
.01 milligrams of cannabinoids per

107
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,978
kilogram of body weight of the patient

108
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:29,279
per day all the way up to 100 milligrams

109
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:31,918
per kilogram so here we have like a 10

110
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,138
000 fold dosing range which is quite

111
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,478
unusual and like I said there's some

112
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,780
outliers but you I've seen people I'd

113
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,478
start them at one milligram of uh maybe

114
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,279
THC before bed and they sleep well and

115
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,439
they never have to titrate after that

116
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,258
and then we published a case last year

117
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,560
of a woman that was taking around 7 000

118
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,939
milligrams of total cannabinoids daily

119
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,699
with breast cancer and she did really

120
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:59,699
well with that even these huge doses are

121
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,040
far from the top toxic doses in primates

122
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,439
monkeys were treated with 9 000

123
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,360
milligrams per kilogram of THC and they

124
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,040
survive that even though I'm sure they

125
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,300
did not enjoy that

126
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,759
laughs and now within this huge broad

127
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,680
dosing range we have non-linear dose

128
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,479
response effects which means as you

129
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,340
start at a low dose and titrate up

130
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,099
people will start getting better and

131
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,799
better results until you go past some

132
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,780
threshold and beyond that the patient

133
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,240
starts building tolerance and losing

134
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,219
efficacy so these are non-linear dose

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,379
response effects and they show up all

136
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,780
over the pre-clinical literature of

137
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:39,240
cannabis here's an example of locomotor

138
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,579
activity in rats and as you can see

139
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,879
let's see if I can get my um

140
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:47,819
my laser to work here

141
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,180
is it up there it's a little dim but as

142
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:54,240
you can see if you go at a low dose 0.2

143
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,280
milligrams per kilogram of THC locomotor

144
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,620
activity decreases so these rats aren't

145
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,939
running around as much as you increase

146
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,399
the dose of THC the locomotor activity

147
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:07,079
increases above the Baseline and then as

148
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,279
you increase it even more it goes back

149
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,180
down again

150
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,918
This Is Not Unusual with um with

151
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,720
cannabinoids Not Unusual when

152
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,120
interfacing with a homeostatic

153
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,979
regulatory system and it shows up all

154
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,800
over the place not just in rats but also

155
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:25,620
in humans and not just with THC but also

156
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,139
with CBD here's an example of a study in

157
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,538
humans that was looking at purified CBD

158
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,180
for treating anxiety and they tested

159
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:36,120
that with a public speaking Challenge

160
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:40,319
and you can see here that 300 milligrams

161
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,120
of CBD reduced anxiety 100 did not and

162
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,280
900 did not

163
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,720
there's a sweet spot in there and what

164
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,538
about all the doses that they didn't

165
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,979
test in this study what else are we

166
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,019
missing that's what I want you to keep

167
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,300
asking where are my blind spots and what

168
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:57,538
else am I missing the 300 milligrams of

169
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,240
CBD could outperform clonazepam and 900

170
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,740
do nothing now throughout the years of

171
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,360
my clinical practice we've had

172
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,860
experience with this I've met a lot of

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,139
people that were down here in the red

174
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,960
circle and I taught them how to get back

175
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,720
up here to their optimal dose a dose at

176
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:15,120
which people do not have tolerance they

177
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,520
maintain efficacy for years or decades

178
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,439
and they have less side effects and

179
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,978
better efficacy

180
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:25,139
so we have had this experience of

181
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:27,418
reducing the dose of cannabis and

182
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,079
getting better results

183
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:32,459
what might be going on down here that we

184
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,839
don't know about

185
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,159
so this is something that's been

186
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,579
interesting me

187
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,360
and there's a there's a concept in

188
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:45,000
biology that the term was coined in 1943

189
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,879
it's called hormesis and it's derived

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,339
from the Greek term to excite it

191
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,800
describes a dose dose response

192
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,258
phenomenon in which a low dose will

193
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,418
stimulate and a high dose can inhibit

194
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,379
and it was discovered using the

195
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:03,000
fungicidal extract of the red cedar tree

196
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:06,659
and the researchers

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,240
mentioned on this page they they looked

198
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,160
at concentrations of this anti-fungal

199
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,199
and tested it against numerous fungal

200
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,000
species and they notice that at higher

201
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,580
concentrations it was an anti-fungal it

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,038
killed the fungus but if you diluted it

203
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,359
enough it would make the fungus grow

204
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,120
faster

205
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,639
why would an anti-fungal at a low

206
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,579
concentration increase the rate of

207
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,740
growth anybody got an idea

208
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,838
I'm I mean it put your hand up if you've

209
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,639
got an idea

210
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,380
sure nobody

211
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,379
all right oh yeah Mike

212
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,458
exactly so he said we have mechanisms

213
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,920
that are designed to detoxify and when

214
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:56,458
you use those well so how I would frame

215
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:59,458
this is that when we challenge the cell

216
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:02,099
with an a toxin at a concentration

217
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,018
that's not high enough to kill it but is

218
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,320
high enough to turn on those Cellular

219
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:10,320
Defense and repair mechanisms then we

220
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,240
get a net benefit right we we nudge the

221
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,399
health of that cell just enough that

222
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,440
it's upregulated and I think that a lot

223
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,080
of you are familiar with this concept

224
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,720
right the best example in your lives

225
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,160
hopefully is exercise if you exercise

226
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,080
too much you're going to hurt yourself

227
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,360
but if you exercise the right amount

228
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,420
you're providing a stress to your system

229
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,399
that allows it to get stronger so this

230
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:34,979
is like the what doesn't kill me makes

231
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,839
me stronger and one way in which we

232
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,759
respond to exercises through the

233
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,160
endocannabinoid system here you can see

234
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,778
more than a doubling of anonymide levels

235
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,600
after 30 minutes of running on a

236
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:47,220
treadmill singers get this from singing

237
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,399
as well

238
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,440
so looking at some of the other things

239
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,958
in our lives you a lot of you may have

240
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,300
heard about Resveratrol this is a

241
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,299
compound in foods that is believed to

242
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:02,519
have helped the French prevent heart

243
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,679
disease by drinking wine I'm not sure it

244
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,419
works like that this is an antioxidant

245
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,759
and if you look at the potential

246
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:10,500
benefits you'll see that it kind of

247
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,259
looks like cannabis anti-cancer

248
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,600
anti-aging neuroprotection anti-diabetic

249
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:17,338
cardio protective and so forth here's a

250
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,019
molecule that does all these different

251
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,240
things and even though it's an

252
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,519
antioxidant the quantities of

253
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,740
Resveratrol that we consume aren't going

254
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,959
to provide orac values that have all of

255
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,180
those effects in our body so what's

256
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:33,479
Resveratrol doing it's actually up

257
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:35,819
regulating our endogenous antioxidant

258
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,399
and repair mechanisms so you could think

259
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,519
of it almost like a toxin that's making

260
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,220
us stronger Resveratrol like cannabis

261
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,320
has a lot of hormetic effects and as you

262
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,500
can see on the right this is a rodent

263
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,720
study of a model of heart attack at low

264
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,019
doses of Resveratrol the damage and

265
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,759
apoptosis to the heart is decreased but

266
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,860
if you go too high on the dose of

267
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,319
Resveratrol you actually increase the

268
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,839
damage to the heart you see that so it's

269
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,720
a healthy thing at a low dose but it can

270
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,760
be toxic at a higher dose however let's

271
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,399
look at another model of Resveratrol

272
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,919
here are breast cancer cells and you can

273
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,320
see that at low concentrations it's

274
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,179
accelerating the growth of these cells

275
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,000
but at high concentrations it's

276
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,399
inhibiting how do you get it right

277
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,440
how do we know and how do we use

278
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,360
hormesis in medicine well it's actually

279
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,820
used a lot in medicine here's one

280
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,320
example that some of you may be familiar

281
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,420
with it's called preconditioning

282
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,120
hormesis so if you remember the movie

283
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:38,219
The Princess Bride the pirate was going

284
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,959
through this battle of wits with the the

285
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,759
clever villain and there was poison that

286
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,439
could be placed in one Goblet of wine or

287
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,720
the other but the pirate put it in both

288
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,420
because he had spent years before this

289
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,339
battle of wits taking tiny doses of the

290
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,620
same Poison every day and gradually

291
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,959
increasing his dose so that if he ever

292
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,459
had this opportunity he would win the

293
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,619
battle

294
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:04,319
um that's preconditioning hormesis he

295
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,259
took tiny doses of a toxin to upregulate

296
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,180
his endogenous healing mechanisms so

297
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,519
that when he had a big challenge he

298
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,919
could handle it it's not exactly the

299
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,839
same as the idea of probably the old

300
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,179
definition of vaccines who knows what's

301
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,560
happened to the new one but not exactly

302
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,479
the same as that but kind of similar

303
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,099
right expose yourself to a non-lethal

304
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,079
dose of something that could prepare you

305
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,240
for something bigger in the future so

306
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,519
that's preconditioning hormesis and then

307
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,639
there's also post-conditioning hormesis

308
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,659
oops what happened we went back

309
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,519
post-conditioning hormesis which is

310
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,838
probably most well known in Homeopathy

311
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,539
but what a lot of you probably don't

312
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,899
know is that cannabis has been in the

313
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:46,679
world of Homeopathy since 1841 and you

314
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:49,559
give tiny tiny tiny doses of cannabis to

315
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,479
people that exhibit the symptoms of

316
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,159
having too much cannabis they haven't

317
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,240
had too much cannabis but those are

318
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,879
their symptoms so you're giving

319
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,740
something similar that could produce

320
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,899
those in a big dose but you're giving it

321
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,600
such a small dose that the body will

322
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:08,059
correct it'll again upregulate these

323
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,060
corrective mechanisms in our physiology

324
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:13,199
so how does cannabis work well I think a

325
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,299
lot of us are focused on the way in

326
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,019
which it mimics and supports our innate

327
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:21,719
stress response Pathways but could it

328
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:23,039
also act as a hormetic stressor and I'm

329
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,899
going to show you some evidence that it

330
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,419
certainly can and I want to orient you

331
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,639
to this ultra low dose now it's

332
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:32,639
impossible to convert a dose that's

333
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:36,120
injected into a rodent into an oral dose

334
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,500
for humans but I do my best here so um a

335
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,659
lot of these studies I'm about to show

336
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,659
you use

337
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:44,958
.002 milligrams of THC per kilogram of

338
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:47,100
body weight of the rodent

339
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,319
intraperitoneal injection is about five

340
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,480
times better absorbed than oral there's

341
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,579
this kind of allometric scaling law from

342
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,639
rodents to people and so what we might

343
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:58,259
end up with is somebody my size uh

344
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,500
having or a little a little smaller than

345
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:03,899
me having like a 20th of a milligram of

346
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,100
THC orally this is the kind of dosing

347
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,740
range that I'm about to show you

348
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,839
something between like a hundred and a

349
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,419
half of milligram of THC let's just give

350
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,800
it a range okay so we're actually going

351
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,860
to start out just a little bit lower

352
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:19,740
here's a study from 2007 in which a

353
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,560
single injection of .001 milligrams per

354
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,379
kilogram had a significant negative

355
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,419
impact on the performance of the mice

356
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,338
three weeks later and their their

357
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:31,799
performance was in a stressful memory

358
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:34,500
test called The Morris water maze test

359
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,179
okay one teeny injection measure them

360
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,159
three weeks later compared to vehicle

361
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:40,259
and the ones that got the small dose of

362
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,958
THC did worse

363
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:44,879
also interestingly when you give a high

364
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,458
dose of THC to rodents they get

365
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,379
hypothermia analgesia and decreased

366
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:51,479
Locomotion also catalepsi but they

367
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,639
didn't do that in this study give this

368
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,579
tiny dose of THC to the rodents and they

369
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,459
get the opposite they get warmer they

370
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:01,859
get sensitive to pain and they and they

371
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,838
run around more what the heck is going

372
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,519
on here we saw these paradoxical effects

373
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,800
with an overdose now we're seeing

374
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,959
paradoxical effects with an underdose or

375
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,539
maybe the 10 Megs per kig is the

376
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,879
overdose it's hard to say so then a

377
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:17,219
subsequent study looked at .002

378
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,860
milligrams per kilogram a single

379
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,800
injection which was able to induce

380
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,100
measurable cognitive deficits in normal

381
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:29,159
mice five months later give them a

382
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,920
single shot of .002 measure them five

383
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,480
months later compared to the vehicle and

384
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,299
and you can determine that they're

385
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,159
impaired and and you can measure

386
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:40,019
different Pathways have been up

387
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,759
regulated in the cerebellum five months

388
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,220
later in mice after a single injection

389
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,539
now what's strange about these mice

390
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,220
they're normal

391
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:48,958
that's the strangest thing about them

392
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,220
something that I can't claim about any

393
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:56,159
of you out there or about myself

394
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:59,040
because who who Among Us is a wild type

395
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,799
with no other toxins or challenges in

396
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,799
their life right so what happens when we

397
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:08,719
treat mice that maybe have a challenge

398
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,759
in their life so this is a

399
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,759
toxin called

400
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:16,500
penciling tetrazole and it was injected

401
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,899
at a high dose 60 milligrams per

402
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,519
kilogram it's known to produce

403
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,259
neurotoxicity and in this study the

404
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,440
researchers administered that same

405
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,480
single dose of THC but either before the

406
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,279
toxic challenge or after so

407
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,259
preconditioning or post-conditioning

408
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,899
like we talked about one three or seven

409
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:36,659
days before or one or three days after

410
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,639
the behavioral tests evaluated different

411
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:40,500
aspects of memory and learning three to

412
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,539
seven weeks later and what these

413
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,919
researchers found was that both the

414
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:45,899
preconditioning and the

415
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,539
post-conditioning administration of

416
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:51,958
ultra low-dose THC completely

417
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:54,899
obliterated the damage from the toxic

418
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:58,018
Challenge and demonstrated reduced

419
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:00,299
phosphorylated erk activity

420
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,519
so we have evidence of ultra low-dose

421
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,338
pre and post conditioning and a toxic

422
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,900
challenge this is the difference between

423
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:08,818
using cannabis and isolated environment

424
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,319
where it could actually reduce the

425
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:12,899
function because you're giving it maybe

426
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,000
a tiny bit of a toxin versus using it to

427
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,339
up regulate the healing now it doesn't

428
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,439
just do that in the brain it does that

429
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,480
in the heart here's a single low dose

430
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,360
administered two hours before a

431
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,220
myocardial infarction look at the size

432
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,438
of the infarct difference in that bar

433
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,558
graph and that was the best result but

434
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,480
if you administered it 48 hours before a

435
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,339
heart attack you still got measurable

436
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,380
statistically significant cardio

437
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:40,079
protection if you gave the same load

438
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,780
dose every day for three weeks in Step

439
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:45,359
24 hours before the heart attack still

440
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,099
got cardio protection what could these

441
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,719
ultra low doses be doing it's not just

442
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,000
in the brain not just in the heart it's

443
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,940
also in the liver here's liver enzyme

444
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,579
measurements when the ultra low dose of

445
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:00,058
THC was administered two hours before an

446
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:02,460
ischemia reperfusion injury in rodents

447
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:04,500
and you can see much lower levels of alt

448
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,360
and AST on the right on the left it's

449
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,298
the Sham group that just got the surgery

450
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,298
but not the liver injury

451
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:14,099
so so that's all just purified THC and

452
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:16,079
an ultra low dose just a little sample

453
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:17,279
of what's out there and then here we

454
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,740
have

455
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,538
um a lower dose but not ultra low dose

456
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,298
three milligrams per kilogram per day

457
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:27,119
given to mice that had uh cognitive

458
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:29,639
decline so these are old mice they're

459
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:33,298
exhibiting signs of dementia give them

460
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,759
this low dose of THC for a month and it

461
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:38,339
restored the gene transcription patterns

462
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,679
so that the expression of these THC

463
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:42,899
treated 12-month-old mice was almost

464
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,240
identical to the two-month-old mice

465
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,100
literally like turned the gene

466
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,919
expression in their mind around in their

467
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:51,659
brain around here's here's a map just to

468
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,940
remind you that we're dealing with a lot

469
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,538
of complexity here these are all the

470
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:00,120
genes that had a change from uh compared

471
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,980
to vehicle all of these different genes

472
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,199
were upregulated in pink and some were

473
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,419
down regulated and the pathways are

474
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,640
interrelated we are living in such a

475
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:12,059
complex this diagram makes me think of

476
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,559
like trying to use our equipment to

477
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:16,319
understand something that's much more

478
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,759
intelligent than us right and and we're

479
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,798
getting there but we're definitely not

480
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,298
there I'm sure this is also just the tip

481
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:23,519
of the iceberg

482
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:27,000
so now we're back to ultra low dose 24

483
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,519
month old mice injected with the .002

484
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,259
milligrams per kilogram performs

485
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,900
significantly better than those that did

486
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:37,319
not get that injection or not get the

487
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,440
THC and perform similarly to mice age

488
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:43,859
two months so the last study was low

489
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,820
dose every day for 28 days this was a

490
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:50,459
single ultra low dose injection restored

491
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:53,700
24 month old mice to the behavior levels

492
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,079
of two month and that effect lasted for

493
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,840
seven weeks

494
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:00,899
what the heck is going on here in this

495
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,459
ultra low dose range and the pathways by

496
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,679
which this worked some of them were

497
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,419
elucidated sir two and one is a pathway

498
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,240
that's gaining a lot of attention kind

499
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,160
of in the biohacking world and oh yeah

500
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,319
and then the MRI just demonstrated

501
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,779
larger volume and higher tissue density

502
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:17,700
in various regions of the brain and the

503
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,099
mice that receive the THC it actually

504
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,380
changed the volume of their brain a

505
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:24,538
single ultra low dose measurable

506
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,880
differences for seven weeks and then the

507
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:29,640
last rodent model I'll show you this is

508
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,500
a familial Alzheimer's disease model

509
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,059
mice that were either six or twelve

510
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,000
months were given a single low-dose

511
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:38,879
injection ultra low dose injection and a

512
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,740
lot of cognitive tests what's

513
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,559
interesting here is on the left that's

514
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,980
the water Morris maze the higher levels

515
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:49,259
oh okay so dark is vehicle light is

516
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,538
ultra low dose WT means the wild type

517
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:54,599
the healthy mice and the TG means

518
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:56,339
transgenic the Alzheimer's mice and if

519
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,019
you just look at Alzheimer's mice you

520
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,659
can see getting that ultra low dose of

521
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,460
THC really improve their performance on

522
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,558
this water maze test it also improved

523
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,538
the performance a little bit of the wild

524
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,279
type mice if you look at the novel

525
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:09,720
location recognition in the middle you

526
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,178
can see the wild type was a trend

527
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,579
towards decreased performance and same

528
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:17,580
in the Y maze so again we have the same

529
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:19,859
thing that might be gently hurting wild

530
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:22,319
type mice helping mice that have a

531
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:23,759
disease that's an important point and

532
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:28,379
then yesterday we heard about the trick

533
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,779
B1 receptor pathway for bdnf well these

534
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,720
transgenic Alzheimer's mice they express

535
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:36,000
a truncated trip B receptor that's not

536
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,519
functional it's like a broken receptor

537
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,500
and the ratio of that broken receptor to

538
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,440
the fully functional receptor determines

539
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,359
our capacity to respond to bdnf and grow

540
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,580
new neurons and new synapses and heal

541
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,918
the brain and you can see here also the

542
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:52,379
ultra low dose of THC significantly

543
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,360
reduce the expression of that truncated

544
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,340
receptor meaning their bdnf pathway

545
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,918
pathway was work looking better

546
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,839
so these what are the mechanisms we

547
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,320
talked about hormesis but I want to go

548
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,599
beyond hormesis into pharmacodynamic and

549
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:08,099
pharmacokinetic Synergy that means how

550
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,439
they're working together or how they're

551
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:12,359
absorbed and metabolized because so far

552
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,659
we've only talked about THC but let's

553
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,699
look at cbda for example now the scale

554
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,620
here is micrograms per kilogram not

555
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,319
milligrams per kilogram and you can see

556
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:25,379
here that half or one microgram per

557
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:28,139
kilogram of cbda reduces nausea and

558
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,419
rodents which is very different from CBD

559
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,059
you can see the effectiveness of CBD is

560
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:36,059
here at 5 or 10 milligrams per kilogram

561
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:39,359
not half of a microgram per kilogram so

562
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:42,359
much higher potency not you know what

563
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,619
else you see with the CBD picture is the

564
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,158
um

565
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:50,279
there we go so you can see that um at

566
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,900
very high doses of CBD even without the

567
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,178
lithium chloride challenge even just

568
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,919
with saline you get some nausea and at

569
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,960
the 20 and 40 milligrams per kilogram

570
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,520
you get an exacerbation of the effects

571
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,500
of the lithium chloride which is what

572
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,960
causes the nausea so we're back to this

573
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,319
biphasic dose response model right

574
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,360
there's a sweet spot in there so um so

575
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,658
what about combinations here's a study

576
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:16,199
that looked at Ultra low-dose thca and

577
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:18,980
cbda in combination for nausea these are

578
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,960
tiny tiny doses

579
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,079
.0001 milligrams per kilogram of cbda

580
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,960
another very low dose of thca these two

581
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:29,939
doses on their own are not effective put

582
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,798
them together and you see that they are

583
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,960
effective with the bar graph that goes

584
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:36,298
down in the middle and then if you block

585
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,340
the P power Alpha receptor you

586
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,500
ameliorate that benefit and if you block

587
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:41,399
the serotonin receptor it goes away as

588
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,919
well

589
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,380
similar things happen with cbda and pain

590
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,980
here you see 10 micrograms per kilogram

591
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,720
of cbda reducing hyperalgesia but a

592
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,900
thousand micrograms per kilogram meaning

593
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,980
one milligram per kilogram not reducing

594
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,620
hyperalgesia there's another sweet spot

595
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,140
here do you need the tiniest little bit

596
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:04,079
of cbda maybe it's it's hard to know

597
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,200
this is a model of inflammatory pain

598
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,779
and the cbda was only effective when

599
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,659
given before the inflammatory Challenge

600
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:15,178
and that was given via injection however

601
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:18,900
if you give it orally and you give it

602
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:21,480
with a teeny bit of THC a bit of THC on

603
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,759
its own that does nothing so now we're

604
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,558
at 100 micrograms per kilogram but when

605
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,058
you give them together orally it works

606
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:28,980
that's what we're seeing here and it

607
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:31,079
even works when you give it after the

608
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,500
inflammatory insult so it works even

609
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:37,439
better than than the cbda on its own at

610
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,599
the precise dose when it's injected

611
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,460
what's going on with cbda here's an

612
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,259
example of pharmacokinetic interactions

613
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,200
this was a beautiful study from Jonathan

614
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,000
Arnold's group in Australia they tested

615
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,798
a whole plant compound which you see on

616
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,798
the left it's got just about everything

617
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:55,200
in it you know acidics and neutrals and

618
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,658
then they tested the exact same doses of

619
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,900
those isolated substances for oral

620
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,460
bioavailability in rodents and this is

621
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,320
what you would expect to find when you

622
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,779
administer lipophilic compounds together

623
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,700
they can compete with absorption and so

624
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:11,399
you would expect to see better

625
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,679
absorption from purified CBD than the

626
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,298
same dose of CBD given in the context of

627
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,940
this extract

628
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:20,099
so that's a normal finding this was the

629
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,080
unexpected finding cbda when

630
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,538
administered in the context of the full

631
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,418
plant extract was much much better

632
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:29,819
absorbed 14 times better absorbed than

633
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:33,299
the same dose given on its own

634
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:35,158
why is cbda absorbed so much better when

635
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,379
it's given in the full plant extract

636
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,320
well these researchers determined that

637
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,778
there's an e-flex pump called the bcrp

638
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,759
that kicks these cannabinoids back into

639
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:47,579
the Lumen of the intestine as they're

640
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:50,819
being absorbed but if you have a little

641
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:52,740
bit of CBG or a little bit of THC in

642
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:56,099
there it blocks the function of this

643
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,620
efflux pump in relation to cbda and it

644
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:00,959
makes you absorb much more cbda so 14

645
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:04,079
times the absorption when there's a tiny

646
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,298
bit of THC or CVG we haven't proven this

647
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,480
in humans but we do have some human data

648
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:12,538
that shows that cbda is much much better

649
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,519
absorbed than CBD again in in these

650
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:18,419
studies it was between 5 and 11 times

651
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:22,019
better absorbed thca is 32 to 51 times

652
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:23,520
better absorbed than THC just remarkable

653
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:26,519
so we're going to bring it home right

654
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,400
now and I just want to remind you that

655
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,240
there's a lot of cannabinoids in the

656
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,880
plant

657
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,159
and we're exposed to them at ultra low

658
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,700
doses all the time

659
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,620
what is going on here we don't know but

660
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,840
we can have a direct relationship with

661
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:44,759
the plant to help us find out I'm going

662
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,199
to skip through one example of clinical

663
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,960
data because I want to get to my

664
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,960
recommendations and maybe a question or

665
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,640
two so for researchers I encourage you

666
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,860
to take what you've learned today and

667
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,620
design studies that include a range of

668
00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:01,319
doses or concentrations that can reveal

669
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:03,298
non-linear dose response effects and

670
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,819
please don't don't forget to go down a

671
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:07,379
microgram per kilogram rodent studies if

672
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:09,599
you have the opportunity to do so

673
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,880
because you probably find some very

674
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,819
interesting things down there

675
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,600
test trace cannabinoids and other

676
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:17,819
phytoconstituents alone and in

677
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,439
combinations we have Hina needs and

678
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,298
daddy that have been doing this and

679
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,778
that's really exciting that's where this

680
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:27,058
research needs to go

681
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:29,159
for producers I encourage you to test a

682
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:31,319
broad to include a broad range of

683
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,840
compounds try to get as much from that

684
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,879
flower into the bottle as you can avoid

685
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,980
complete decarboxylation because even

686
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,440
tiny bits of these acidic cannabinoids

687
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,360
go a long way as you could see they

688
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,659
might actually go a longer way than

689
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,879
higher Doses and please make your labels

690
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:50,220
and certificates of analysis easy to

691
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,600
understand I just uh that's a big

692
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,100
problem in this industry I don't think

693
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,538
it's been mentioned much it should be

694
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,399
easy for a patient to know how much

695
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:59,220
they're getting per drop or per serving

696
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,019
here's an example of a part of the COA

697
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,778
from a Healer product called balance

698
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:06,480
which includes 19 chemovars six of them

699
00:28:03,778 --> 00:28:10,019
are CBD dominant type 3 and the rest are

700
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,000
type one we blend as many together as we

701
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:15,359
can it's half decarboxylated it's got

702
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,940
equal proportions of CBD cbda THC thca

703
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,038
this is like a shotgun product I hope

704
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,960
that eventually we know here's the

705
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:24,599
specific chemother for this specific

706
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,038
problem and this specific person with

707
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:28,019
their current functional status and

708
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,240
their genetics we're far from that right

709
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,819
now so until I can get my laser pointer

710
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,179
and a sniper rifle we're going to go

711
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:38,099
with the shotgun right the balance for

712
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:40,380
clinicians and patients I encourage you

713
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:42,719
to explore this oral dosing range in

714
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,220
your patients don't start too high this

715
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,798
means starting as low as half a

716
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,259
milligram or maybe one milligram for the

717
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,418
average adult and if you do that and you

718
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:53,099
take your time and wait they might not

719
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,778
get great results the next morning and

720
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,099
be like oh my God that was amazing my

721
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:57,900
life has changed you gave me my life

722
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:00,839
back I know it feels really good to hear

723
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,240
that but if they stay consistent with

724
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,798
low doses for a little while they'll get

725
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,900
some impressive results you'll be

726
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,220
surprised

727
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,419
and that's especially with acidic

728
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,000
cannabinoids and whole plant

729
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:13,559
preparations and titrate slowly if

730
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,019
possible

731
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,639
use cannabis to improve resilience to

732
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:19,200
stress don't always think about it for

733
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,940
treating a disease think about what

734
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,519
could it do to up regulate your natural

735
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,100
healing mechanisms turning on these

736
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,259
intrinsic mechanisms May provide better

737
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,298
results than just ameliorating symptoms

738
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:31,919
because you're getting healthier you're

739
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:34,558
getting stronger you're getting more fit

740
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,240
for your environment your homeostatic

741
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,038
physiology is functioning more

742
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,599
efficiently and that's not only going to

743
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:41,819
make you feel better but prevent future

744
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,439
disease instead of just covering up a

745
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,778
symptom without addressing the

746
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,298
underlying vulnerability so watch for

747
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:50,880
gradual changes healing versus symptom

748
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:53,038
relief and secondary outcomes and side

749
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,960
benefits

750
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:59,220
and know yourself

751
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,740
cannabis is very complex but so are you

752
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,600
and you have a direct relationship with

753
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,579
this plant or at least the capacity to

754
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,259
do so so the Cannabis State of

755
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:10,319
Consciousness can be extremely

756
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:12,359
empowering for self-awareness and body

757
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,819
awareness one can use a little bit of

758
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,579
THC and actually go inside and feel and

759
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:19,619
get extremely accurate messages about

760
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:21,480
what's happening inside of them so allow

761
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:23,939
the Consciousness shifting aspect of

762
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,220
cannabis from time to time to help you

763
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,558
get better in touch with yourself with

764
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,179
all our healer products we include these

765
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:31,980
guides so people can check in with

766
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,259
themselves do the inner inventory write

767
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,558
it down on the worksheet and so forth

768
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:39,179
and then my last recommendation page if

769
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,038
you're a patient and you're not using

770
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,778
acidic cannabinoids I highly encourage

771
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,278
you to do so easiest way is take a

772
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:46,619
little bud and throw it in your morning

773
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:48,359
tea or coffee you'll steep it you'll get

774
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:49,979
a little bit out of that and I can tell

775
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,439
you more about that if you need to avoid

776
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,360
tolerance in most cases so check out

777
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,580
that sensitization protocol if you feel

778
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,798
like you're over you using you'll have a

779
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:00,359
much healthier and more fruitful

780
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,519
relationship with cannabis if you

781
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,798
reverse tolerance and then be aware of

782
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,440
the subtle benefits try a variety of

783
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,720
chemovirus and blends of chemovirus and

784
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,759
and the cannabis tea is just a great

785
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,940
thing for a lot of people thank you so

786
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,940
much

787
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,679
foreign

788
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:31,320
for your great talk and your great work

789
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:34,980
I wanted to ask you a what do you think

790
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:37,139
how low would you go

791
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,640
would you

792
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,640
touch that

793
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,640
um humans

794
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,759
humans

795
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,819
uh what what is the line between going

796
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:55,079
low and

797
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:57,119
party yeah so I think that um well

798
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,918
because I've seen results in adults at

799
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,019
half a milligram of an active

800
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,700
constituent today that's how low I go

801
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,859
right now I don't like to waste a lot of

802
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,340
people's time and that might still be a

803
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:10,558
time waster I skipped over a study in

804
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:13,019
fibromyalgia of women with fibromyalgia

805
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,480
where they started at one about one

806
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:18,298
milligram of THC per day and were

807
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,700
titrated only every 10 days and they had

808
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:23,038
fabulous results with with that type of

809
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,380
titration they went from one to two you

810
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,298
know every 10 days so something low and

811
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,600
slow to me sounds like that half a

812
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:32,639
milligram to one milligram

813
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,678
good morning Dustin thank you so much

814
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,840
and for your spirit here

815
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,820
um question so titrating to find that

816
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,819
optimal dosage how about for tolerance

817
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:43,319
breaks do you is it cold turkey titrate

818
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:46,259
down what's your recommendation for that

819
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:49,079
so the way I've framed the sensitization

820
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,538
protocol on healer.com involves 48 Hours

821
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,519
of abstinence from Cannabis but it's

822
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:54,839
very intentional and I have all sorts of

823
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,000
videos to hold your hand through that

824
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,099
and give you exercises bright breathing

825
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,538
meditations things to to get you through

826
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:02,819
that there's a lot that you can do to

827
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:05,640
get go through that 48 hours but a lot

828
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:07,139
of there's one fmri study in men at

829
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,880
least that were heavy cannabis smokers

830
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,100
that showed after just 48 Hours of

831
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,980
abstinence their CB1 receptors in the

832
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:15,898
brain return to normal levels so I think

833
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,519
that's one beautiful thing about

834
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:19,979
cannabis is we don't need super long

835
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,839
tolerance breaks 48 hours can do it but

836
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,519
then we continue with three days that

837
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,259
the key to the sensitization protocol

838
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,599
isn't just the tolerance break it's what

839
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:29,339
you do afterwards it's how you change

840
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,019
your relationship with the plant to

841
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:32,939
listen to its effects on your body body

842
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:34,740
so that you don't get into a tolerance

843
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,000
problem again in the future so that's

844
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,460
what's happening over the next three

845
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,140
days very careful titration and you can

846
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,538
get that all it's all complementary on

847
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:46,038
