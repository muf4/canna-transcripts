00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,960
hi everybody

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:09,039
thanks for uh coming to my talk

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,039
so i'm going to be talking about

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,558
cannabis medicine for children i think

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,039
you guys all know my background so i'm

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,879
not going to spend any time on that but

7
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,118
um i wanted to do something a little bit

8
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,599
different today i think just even for my

9
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,920
own entertainment to um mix it up a

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,359
little bit because i talk about a lot of

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,599
the same things over and over and i'm

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,118
sorry to those who were here

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,118
tuesday for the practicum there will be

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,640
a little overlap but i i do try to go

15
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,920
into more detail since i have a little

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
more time

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
so

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,359
i wanted to start with something

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,680
i've been doing this now about 14 years

20
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,359
and i've been a physician for 30 plus

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,039
years and

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,640
i just want to share with you all a few

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,559
things i've learned

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,679
working with cannabis and working with

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:56,320
sick people including very sick children

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,840
and so this is like my favorite part of

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,159
my show right here

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,320
this is why we all do what we do and

29
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,079
thank you to all the researchers to

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,079
medical genomics for putting on this

31
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,280
conference for all the sponsors for

32
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,200
everybody here who does their part in

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,719
cannabis i know we're all like-minded

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,439
and these are

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,560
the most vulnerable patients and some of

36
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:22,319
these kids have cancer some have

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,719
epilepsy some have autism some have

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,199
you know irreversible brain damage it's

39
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,519
um

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,280
this is why we all should be doing what

41
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,759
we're doing and i know we all have our

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,920
stories we have our our mother was sick

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,280
or our best friend or our brother but

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,840
really um this is what drives me

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,599
to try to make it better to try to get

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,759
better products to try to get more

47
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,000
research and so on so

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
um i'm just gonna tell you about a few

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
things i've learned so sorry about that

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,280
other thing shouldn't be there but i

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,118
guess i screwed up on my animations but

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
what it what have i learned cannabis is

53
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,118
good medicine right now you could say

54
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,959
it's great medicine

55
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,118
but i say good medicine i'm talking

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,199
about you know when you say oh that that

57
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,560
that's a good person or she's good

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,159
people this is good medicine why is it

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,318
good medicine because

60
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,199
we routinely witness improvements in

61
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,280
symptoms and quality of life even when

62
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,238
you don't even know what you're doing

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,560
with it

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,120
right you can go in and buy some

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
cannabis and walk out and you say oh you

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,480
know i didn't know what i was doing i

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,319
slept great and i was nicer to my

68
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,079
husband the next day and i didn't yell

69
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,318
at the kids

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,800
it's important to know that

71
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,119
many people are able to lower doses or

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,160
discontinue other medication

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,239
how many here know somebody whether it's

74
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,919
a family member yourself or somebody

75
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,680
you've helped raise your hand if you

76
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,919
know somebody has been able to stop or

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,959
lower dose of other medication right

78
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,679
just about everybody who's worked with

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,080
patients or just even talking to people

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
and then also patient satisfaction is

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,800
exceptionally high

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,519
it's easy to say this anecdotally but

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,519
there was a study back in 2014 86

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,599
percent i don't know of any other drug

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,800
where you get an 86

86
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,359
patient satisfaction and that's because

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,280
even if you miss your dose of cannabis

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,599
probably likely nothing bad is going to

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,158
happen if you overdose on it likely

90
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,560
nothing bad is going to happen so

91
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,679
it's a very easy medicine to work with

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
and i'm still kind of

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,360
i think i said this on tuesday i'm kind

94
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,079
of over it already trying to convince

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,959
people this we have enough data and

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,719
enough research to show that

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,680
patients want this

98
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,280
um there's a study out of stacy gruber's

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,719
group with i think it's how you say

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,439
cigar

101
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,280
12 months of medical cannabis resulted

102
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,439
in significant improvements on measures

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,598
of executive function and clinical state

104
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,479
including sleep pain and quality of life

105
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,518
these are people who were measured and

106
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,359
tested and stacy talks about them being

107
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,480
the most studied group of patients on

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
the planet

109
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,798
before they start medical cannabis and

110
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,318
then she measured it at three months six

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,159
months and here's her 12-month study

112
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,079
that came out last year

113
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,079
clinical improvement was associated with

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,920
higher cbd use

115
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
cognitive improvements were associated

116
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,918
with clinical improvement

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
and what they concluded was medical

118
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,680
cannabis patients may exhibit enhanced

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,160
rather than impaired executive function

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,079
over time we see this over and over i

121
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,320
see this in my pediatric patients they

122
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,839
take mega-high doses of cannabis and

123
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,918
guess what they can finally get back to

124
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,319
school and learning it's the exact

125
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,680
opposite of what we have been taught and

126
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,439
what we've been

127
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,879
propagandized over all these years

128
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,839
second thing i've learned medical

129
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,918
cannabis is safe

130
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,079
now you could argue with me about

131
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,879
problematic use or misuse that's fine

132
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,359
but i'm talking about medical cannabis

133
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:57,120
someone who is using it specifically to

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,319
treat medical condition and so i wanted

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,478
to show you

136
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,240
kind of world we live in so when you

137
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,159
think about medical cannabis and people

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,720
get really i still get from people

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,039
really oh is it safe oh i don't know the

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,360
world we live in has drugs that are so

141
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:15,599
scary look at this a new anti-epileptic

142
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,120
medication is linked to turning you blue

143
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,520
there's something called blue person

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,439
syndrome okay now luckily this came this

145
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,719
was taken off the market but

146
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:27,120
how this got through our regulatory

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,560
institutions is beyond me

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,840
i mean i guess it's okay if you want to

149
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
be blue but

150
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,279
i don't want to be blue how about this

151
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,840
one painful erections while being

152
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,758
treated for ocd i don't know you talking

153
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,038
about trading one condition for another

154
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,479
yes

155
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,079
this is a great one warning this

156
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,319
parkinson's drug can make you addicted

157
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,199
to gambling sex or food so

158
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,000
i

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,080
read this article and this poor elderly

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,918
woman who's struggling with parkinson's

161
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:56,478
turns into a gambling addict she lost

162
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,959
250 000 at the local casino

163
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,719
on the slots and when they discontinued

164
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,758
the drug guess what she never gambled

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,720
again

166
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,240
but yet this is acceptable and i i find

167
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,680
that fascinating and then here's my

168
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,160
favorite everybody

169
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
loss of fingerprints

170
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,039
okay

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
and this is with a cancer drug and luck

172
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,318
hopefully none of you ever have to take

173
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,839
this but i don't know you know pick your

174
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,840
poison right

175
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,839
cannabis doesn't do any of this

176
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,918
help with the slides

177
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,919
am i doing something wrong

178
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,879
it's stuck

179
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,038
how do i unstuck it oh there we go okay

180
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,159
so i just pulled out a few articles and

181
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,159
any

182
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
anybody who sits and read the reads the

183
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,840
medical cannabis literature you're going

184
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,919
to see these words over and over and

185
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,038
over again safe and efficacious well

186
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,598
tolerated mild side effects we really

187
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,279
don't see blue person or loss of

188
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,439
fingerprints or

189
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,119
gambling addiction

190
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,800
here is a study that showed 27 over 2

191
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,800
hundred elderly patients safe and

192
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,639
efficacious and look what it says

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,240
cannabis use may decrease the use of

194
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,478
other prescription medicines including

195
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,598
opioids here's another one

196
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,079
uh 2900 cancer patients cannabis just

197
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,199
for palliation well tolerated effective

198
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,959
and safe but

199
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,879
95.9 reported improvement in their

200
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,239
condition

201
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,120
here's another one

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,038
this is 367 fibromyalgia patients

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,240
medical cannabis appears to be safe and

204
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,159
effective and here's another one

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,160
for autism that just came out this year

206
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,919
a review of cannabis for autism

207
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,759
cannabinoid therapy for autism is

208
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,240
associated with low adverse side effects

209
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,759
and reduction in concomitant medication

210
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
and if you read through the literature

211
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,598
and even if you just sat for an hour

212
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,680
looking you're going to see these same

213
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,839
words over again so

214
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,400
this idea that cannabis medicine is

215
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,478
fringe that it is should be last resort

216
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,478
it's it's just a bunch of nonsense this

217
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,199
medicine is safe and well tolerated

218
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,439
especially under medical supervision and

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,000
even without medical supervision it's

220
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,319
usually very safe and well tolerated

221
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,079
how do we keep it safe all right so see

222
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,000
somebody who does a medical history so

223
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,680
they know what drugs you're taking they

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
know what treatments you tried they do a

225
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,918
physical exam a review of all your

226
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,639
medications and lifestyle prior to onset

227
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,478
so you can get the best result possible

228
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,639
only use tested products that have a

229
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,199
transparent coa if you don't know what's

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,439
in it and you can't reproduce that it's

231
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,520
unlikely to be sustainable medication i

232
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,639
had a patient who

233
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,000
a pediatric patient who has seizures

234
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,559
in fact his picture is one of the

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,240
pictures on my initial slide and his

236
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,918
mother was afraid to tell me this but

237
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,480
she eventually told me that she was

238
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,079
taking the oils like i had recommended

239
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,480
and then a cousin handed her a little

240
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,800
bit of rso oil and she just decided to

241
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,039
give it to him and he had a significant

242
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,639
reductions in seizures had she told me

243
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,399
about it we could have gotten it tested

244
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,120
and figured out what it was she used it

245
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,559
up told me about it six months later and

246
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,159
i was like well

247
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,479
that's really not medicine because you

248
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,000
don't have it anymore so it's very

249
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
important that we're using products that

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,480
we know what's in it we know that it's

251
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,799
reproducible and consistent over time

252
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,039
start low and go slow titration prevents

253
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,439
thc dosing errors

254
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,958
this is important in pediatrics in

255
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,440
elderly patients and really anybody who

256
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,439
is still a little skeptical just this

257
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,920
past thanksgiving i have friends who

258
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,839
i've told them never give a gummy to an

259
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,838
elderly person without cutting it into

260
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,640
pieces but they didn't listen

261
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,040
they gave the night before thanksgiving

262
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,399
he gave his mother with sleep problems

263
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,039
and anxiety and depression a 10

264
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,360
milligram gummy and she basically

265
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,958
had a terrible reaction thanksgiving was

266
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,879
cancelled the next day and they just

267
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,518
kind of babysat her but now she's turned

268
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,200
off to it so remember start low and go

269
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,679
slow especially in those patients who

270
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,278
are cannabis naive

271
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,919
side effects are very rare with

272
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:01,278
non-impairing cannabinoids like cbd cbg

273
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,278
cbda and so on

274
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,039
also side effects are easily mitigated

275
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,799
everybody's heard me say this change the

276
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,639
dose change the timing change the

277
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,479
product you can mitigate you don't have

278
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,078
to have side effects

279
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,519
first time you're trying something new

280
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,199
or someone you know is trying something

281
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,519
new they should be at home

282
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,839
they shouldn't have like a test in two

283
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,919
hours right or uh you know you're

284
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,000
meeting the in-laws for the first time

285
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,799
you want to try it

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
at home first see how you feel even

287
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,919
something that you know may be

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,679
non-impairing you may you may be

289
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,439
sensitive to it so it's important to

290
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,719
keep it safe that way

291
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,320
and then get help if you don't know

292
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,839
where to start or you haven't found

293
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
relief there's so many healthcare

294
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,680
practitioners here today there's so many

295
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,839
nurses and nurse practitioners so many

296
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,039
people to ask for help so please ask for

297
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,959
help if you're not sure what you're

298
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,199
doing or if you think you're doing it

299
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,759
right and you're not getting relief it's

300
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,759
helpful to bounce it off someone else

301
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,919
all right everybody knows this one treat

302
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,679
the patient not the diagnosis we do like

303
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,679
to have an understanding of if you have

304
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,439
this condition or that condition that

305
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,278
maybe you should go in this direction or

306
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,680
that direction is dictated by clinical

307
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,000
experience or by the latest scientific

308
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,239
information but in general we know

309
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,078
personalized individual regimens based

310
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,720
on a patient's response is the way to go

311
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,479
with cannabis and one size does not fit

312
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,000
all and i'm just going to show you this

313
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,440
slide here this is i'm going to be

314
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
talking about this this comes from my

315
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,760
autism research

316
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,160
and you can see the patients age 6 to 12

317
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,000
kind of listed and what sex they are in

318
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,078
their dosages per day but if you look at

319
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,839
the cannabinoid content these are all

320
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,919
children with autism

321
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,440
we these are none of these children have

322
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,679
epilepsy because we that was an

323
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,040
exclusion criteria in our in our um

324
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,359
group

325
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,719
but um you can see they're all on

326
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,399
different

327
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,879
cannabinoid

328
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,879
regimens how did that happen well we

329
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,360
followed my rule it in or rule it out

330
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,278
you start with one thing you titrate up

331
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,600
you look if there's any benefit what

332
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,838
dose is that at can i do better than

333
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,519
that now often with most patients you

334
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,800
hit a point at which you start to have

335
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,679
side effects and then we know that

336
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,679
you're at the ceiling dose cbd can have

337
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,599
a ceiling for some patients i have

338
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,439
patients that get gi upset if you go

339
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
past a certain dose or they get very

340
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,120
sedated if you go past that's their

341
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,440
ceiling dose we're going to stay below

342
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,839
that let's say that only helps them 75

343
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,200
percent they're only 75 percent improved

344
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,600
well there's room for improvement then

345
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
we add a second cannabinoid or we might

346
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
try a different product within the same

347
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,680
category all of these patients were on

348
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,958
cannabis for at least a year and during

349
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,039
that year

350
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,518
was as or even

351
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:36,319
if it was longer than that we worked on

352
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,519
ruling it in ruling it out dialing in on

353
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,278
the products

354
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,639
so always

355
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,799
don't ever think that just because

356
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,360
somebody has one diagnosis this is what

357
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,799
they should be on in the cannabis

358
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,800
world it really should be dialed in

359
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,319
and certainly there's what's happened

360
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,159
now is that when i first started doing

361
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,240
this it was really just thc on the

362
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,639
market and then around 2013 there was

363
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,839
some cbd available and then we started

364
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,320
to see the other compounds come out

365
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,320
now there's so many to choose from so it

366
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,040
makes it a little more difficult but

367
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,480
pick one start there and then go through

368
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,879
and that's why i always say it is

369
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,639
worthwhile if you're dealing with a

370
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,679
significant medical condition to have at

371
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,440
least one consultation with a doctor

372
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,958
nurse practitioner somebody that knows

373
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,240
about this that can at least give you

374
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,719
the lay of the land where does the

375
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,720
research stand and what should i be

376
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
looking at so just to get some signaling

377
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
on that

378
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,519
all right my next is take care of your

379
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,439
gut and you will have a happy

380
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,839
endocannabinoid system

381
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,760
they are intimately related and is very

382
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,360
important you cannot say oh i'm using

383
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,799
cannabis and it's not helping me while

384
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,039
you're eating a cheeseburger and french

385
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:46,000
fries from the greasiest place in town

386
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,919
it's uh you have to help your gut

387
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,159
to move forward so that you can have a

388
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,240
healthy endocannabinoid system

389
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,319
and so there's a article that came out

390
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,639
last year that here's a quote the

391
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,920
endocannabinoid system encompasses a key

392
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,320
interface between the gut microbiota the

393
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,879
immune system and homeostasis of the

394
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,760
human host very important for your gut

395
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,958
to be part of this

396
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,278
endocannabinoids and phytocannabinoids

397
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,039
modulate gut inflammation the microbiota

398
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,120
stabilizing the blood-brain barrier

399
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,039
pathway and reducing neuro-inflammation

400
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,159
we think about inflammation

401
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,919
we are

402
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,679
kind of i once had a doctor an

403
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,240
oncologist tell me that we live in a

404
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,599
cesspool of chemicals right now by the

405
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,278
time you leave your house in the morning

406
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,959
you've probably been exposed to 300

407
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,519
chemicals you might not be able to

408
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:34,000
control some of that but you can control

409
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,560
what you put as my friend says in your

410
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,159
pie hole so it's important to

411
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,239
understand that you want to take care of

412
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,799
your gut and here's just a nice

413
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,440
graphic of this was a article that

414
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,159
looked at how hiv affects the immune

415
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,839
system the gut and ultimately the brain

416
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,319
but as you can see what's at the center

417
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,639
of all of it the endocannabinoid system

418
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,720
and if you're using uh

419
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,799
cannabinoids and you're not finding

420
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,320
benefit think about

421
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,078
taking better care of your gut it's

422
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,720
important because between those two

423
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:07,198
things you can often

424
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,120
mitigate illness

425
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,439
all right and then there's two very nice

426
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,278
articles so dr russo's beyond cannabis

427
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,360
plants in the endocannabinoid system

428
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,600
excellent talking about this very uh

429
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,680
thing and then also an article that's a

430
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,839
little bit older but i find it to be a

431
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,000
really great article the care and

432
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,639
feeding of the endocannabinoid system so

433
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,440
uh two very nice articles that are

434
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,480
uh help you understand the interplay

435
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,639
between

436
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,720
the various systems in your body and

437
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,600
your endocannabinoid system

438
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,000
and then oh let me go back one here so

439
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,240
my number five and before i get on to

440
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,759
the kids is respect your receptors so

441
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,639
i've been joking around about this for

442
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,879
years respect your receptors so um what

443
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,079
this slide shows i don't know let's see

444
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,159
is there a pointer i don't know if you

445
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,399
can see

446
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,159
i don't think it's working

447
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,198
but anyway what you can see here is the

448
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,919
cell

449
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,439
and on the cell wall are cannabinoid

450
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,240
receptors that you can see they kind of

451
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,639
look they're the like little neon yellow

452
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,639
and then

453
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,480
jwh-0108 is a synthetic

454
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,480
thc like compound so it binds to the

455
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,399
type 1 receptor so what you can see on

456
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,000
there is that with this is showing acute

457
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,000
administration in a cannabis naive rat

458
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,440
if you give them this compound all of

459
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,839
the jwh goes ahead and sticks on to the

460
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,759
cannabinoid receptors

461
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,000
and then what happens is with chronic

462
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
use look what's happening here so we

463
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,879
went from a whole bunch of receptors on

464
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:39,278
the cell wall to just a few a lot of the

465
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,360
compound ligand is still floating around

466
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,799
looking for a place to bind and if

467
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,560
you'll notice the little neon

468
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,958
cannabinoid receptors are now

469
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,479
internalized inside the cell

470
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:53,518
and this comes from uh what this is the

471
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,079
concept of tolerance okay sometimes down

472
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,320
regulating your receptors can be helpful

473
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,638
but for the most part if you want a good

474
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,800
medicinal effect you want to try to

475
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,519
maintain a decent amount of cannabinoid

476
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,918
receptors that are not down regulated

477
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,160
and so

478
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,079
in the medical world i don't see too

479
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,839
much tolerance but here and there i do

480
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,720
especially those patients who happen to

481
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,879
be thc responders there are people out

482
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,439
there that do very well with thc i

483
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,439
always try to include some cbd in there

484
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,160
because it does seem to help mitigate

485
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,558
some of the tolerance i always hate to

486
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,320
do it what we call it a tolerance break

487
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,079
especially let's say in a child who's

488
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,639
getting very good results with either

489
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,399
epilepsy or autism because if you take

490
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,400
away their medicine

491
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,038
what happens is event they end up back

492
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,440
at their baseline prior to cannabis use

493
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,440
and so parents will say to me oh there's

494
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,720
no way i'm doing a tolerance break

495
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,480
because i can't do 48 hours of horrific

496
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,400
behaviors because i've now lived three

497
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,720
months without that it's like it's

498
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,559
causing them more trauma so what we do

499
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,279
is we do try to use other tools to

500
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,798
changing chemovars or adding in

501
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,519
um

502
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:05,200
non-thc cannabinoids to try to help do

503
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,240
some of the heavy lifting to try to help

504
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,480
maintain

505
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,599
uh the res the receptors and then when i

506
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,480
often talk with teenagers so if

507
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,918
we get teenagers that come in who um as

508
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,558
i said the other day they know more than

509
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,000
me about their endocannabinoid system so

510
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,359
um they just think all thc all the time

511
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,400
and what ends up happening i actually

512
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,759
had a child who ended up suicidal

513
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,280
he was home

514
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,119
i put him on i said you can use your

515
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,798
vape pen to go to sleep that's fine but

516
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,279
you have to take your cbd in the morning

517
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:38,400
he had terrible anxiety depression and

518
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,960
it had one suicide attempt years prior

519
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
and was just reluctant to take any more

520
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,319
pharmaceuticals

521
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,200
and he was okay with

522
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,879
using cbd added in and after about a

523
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,960
month he decided i don't want to take

524
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,640
the cbd anymore and he's a 17 year old

525
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,919
boy so good luck getting him to take it

526
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,000
and the parents weren't really paying

527
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,600
attention and next phone call i got

528
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,759
about a month later was he was being

529
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,079
held on a you know 51.50 hold for

530
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,200
suicidal but what he had done was

531
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,960
totally escalated his thc use dabbing

532
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,080
and whatnot that the whole rest of that

533
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,079
month so

534
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,918
you know i feel very strongly about this

535
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,279
and i joke around for years that i was

536
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,400
going to make a t-shirt and there's your

537
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,960
t-shirt respect your receptors people

538
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,640
so okay let's get on with the talk for

539
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
children and i just want to point out

540
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,480
this is one of my patients a teenager

541
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,720
with epilepsy and autism drew this

542
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,798
picture to tell me just how much

543
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,640
cannabis impacted his life so how nice

544
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,558
is that it's not a beautiful photo or a

545
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,240
beautiful picture that he drew so the

546
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,720
most common conditions we see in

547
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,279
pediatrics by far intractable epilepsy

548
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,079
and autism they often run together

549
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,399
also cancer either for side effects or

550
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,319
to treat a child who has been given a

551
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,480
very poor prognosis

552
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,159
gi disorders attention deficit and

553
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,319
tourette also

554
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
anxiety depression chronic pain genetic

555
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,918
conditions and certainly end of life

556
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,600
um

557
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,038
i'm going to focus on epilepsy and

558
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,558
autism that's where we have the most

559
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:06,000
data a 2000 study done by quantum brodie

560
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:08,798
showed only 64 of epilepsy patients

561
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,279
respond to uh medications

562
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,798
and then they repeated the study in 2018

563
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,879
to see since there were many new

564
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,558
anti-epileptic drugs on the market and

565
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,799
they found the same thing overall

566
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,879
outcomes and newly diagnosed epilepsy

567
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,960
have not improved and more than one

568
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,559
third of patients experience epilepsy

569
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,720
that remains uncontrolled and this is

570
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,798
where we have to think out of the box i

571
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,880
have many patients that are

572
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,918
up for getting brain surgery

573
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,679
or a device implanted in their chest and

574
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,679
i always say why not try the benign

575
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,120
plant first before you do anything

576
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,519
invasive

577
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,479
i have one child who has has had three

578
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,240
brain surgeries and she was good for one

579
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,279
week after the brain surgery and then

580
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,038
the

581
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,879
seizures came back with a vengeance i'm

582
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,720
not sure how they go back two and three

583
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,559
times because this is certainly not

584
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,038
reversible cannabis has been somewhat

585
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,558
helpful for her condition

586
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,319
this is just a

587
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,079
graph that i made looking at the number

588
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,960
of publications if you just google

589
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,879
cannabidiol and epilepsy or go to pubmed

590
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,360
and you look at the research look at you

591
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,640
know kind of where it course correlates

592
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,158
and

593
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,000
you can see 2013 is when uh cnn aired

594
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,840
the weed documentary with dr sanjay

595
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,079
gupta and it was kind of that kind of

596
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,558
opened the floodgates a bit as he gave

597
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,480
the stamp of mainstream approval there

598
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,558
and as you can see the

599
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,440
scientific and medical community has

600
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:32,079
responded with research so bravo to us

601
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,519
all of us who have participated in that

602
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,439
and now

603
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,839
certainly clinical research supports the

604
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,480
use of cbd to treat refractive

605
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,720
refractory epilepsy this is now

606
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,440
considered to be a very viable

607
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,720
anti-epileptic drug

608
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,320
and i'm just going to go through some of

609
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,480
the latest studies from the past couple

610
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,639
of years that summarize

611
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,480
what we have learned over the last

612
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,600
decade of watching and and listening

613
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
and

614
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,839
researching cbd and other cannabinoids

615
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,279
for epilepsy so

616
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,839
gaston et al

617
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,839
they used purified cbd in 89 children

618
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,839
and 80 adults over two years and they

619
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,079
saw significant mean reduction in

620
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,480
seizure frequency at one month one year

621
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,079
and two years all statistic highly

622
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,000
statistically significant and you can

623
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,558
just see greater than 50 percent seizure

624
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,200
reduction is considered the clinical

625
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:26,000
standard so you can see in children one

626
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,319
month on cbd 46

627
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,480
and it goes up after two years so if you

628
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,839
have patients in the beginning that are

629
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,000
saying well we're not getting the best

630
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:37,038
results hang in there look in adults it

631
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,960
went from 31 to 52

632
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,319
and some of that also too is of course

633
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,919
dosing titrating up slowly over time

634
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,918
there was a significant difference in

635
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,679
seizure severity reduction at one year

636
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,360
with adults reporting greater

637
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,000
improvement in seizure severity and that

638
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,240
was highly significant as well

639
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,919
and here you can see just two charts the

640
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,200
first chart is the percentage change in

641
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,840
seizure frequency and and the um you can

642
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,038
see on the uh axis there the percentage

643
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,639
reduction

644
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,000
from baseline so

645
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,520
from zero

646
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,919
um and it drops how how uh down so it's

647
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,000
minus 60 but that's the percentage

648
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,960
reduction and this is over time over two

649
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,839
years and you can see adults is the um

650
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,679
uh dashed line and pediatrics is the uh

651
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,119
solid line and you can certainly see

652
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,600
that

653
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,719
in the in terms of seizure frequency

654
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,879
it's almost equivalent but in the

655
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,880
second graph you can see that adult

656
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,159
severity went down and that's important

657
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,679
because

658
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,440
often these are people who have

659
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,038
struggled with seizures their whole life

660
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,519
and have not had uh any good results

661
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:46,480
okay how about eeg changes and effect on

662
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,480
sleep so cbd use decreased interactal

663
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,640
epileptic form discharges it's a

664
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
mouthful but this is basically evidence

665
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,278
of a neuroexcitatory brain that was

666
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,759
highly significant and then cbd use

667
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,440
improves sleep microstructure and 84.6

668
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,839
percent of those patients with abnormal

669
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,200
sleep again a very high number

670
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,879
here we have

671
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,360
an evaluation on cognitive and

672
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,120
behavioral tests before and after cbd so

673
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,918
this was before and after just three

674
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,759
months looking at patients 89

675
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,480
remained stable or showed reliable

676
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,720
improvement after three months on cbd

677
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,400
very high percentage right cognitive and

678
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,960
behavioral changes were not

679
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,000
significantly correlated to the cbd

680
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,079
dosing which is always very interesting

681
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,919
improvements in short-term and working

682
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,599
memory significantly related to better

683
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,080
therapy response and there was no

684
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:37,839
adverse group level effects on cbd

685
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:40,240
reported uh in this study

686
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,959
what about long term so

687
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,319
there was a signaling maybe around i

688
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,079
want to say there was a study that came

689
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,319
out of israel a few years ago that said

690
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,240
maybe cbd effects wear off after three

691
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,158
years and i would tell you that here and

692
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,640
there i saw patients who maybe at the

693
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,320
two or three year mark seem to

694
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,159
maybe lose efficacy and remember in

695
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,200
children they're also growing and

696
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,600
changing and hormones and so on so what

697
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,240
is it is it the medicine doesn't really

698
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,399
work after three years well we have now

699
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,079
this study published last year cbd does

700
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,000
not lose efficacy during treatment

701
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,678
period up to five years

702
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,919
most patients in their group were able

703
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,320
to at least decrease the dose of at

704
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,320
least one other pharmaceutical that they

705
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,399
were using for epilepsy

706
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,879
and certainly again here's those words

707
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,278
well tolerated effective and safe for

708
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,840
long-term use and so that definitely

709
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,278
gives those people out there who are

710
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,038
still reluctant

711
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,359
uh to think about cbd as an

712
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,119
anti-epileptic it gives us the assurance

713
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,119
and i'm just going to share with you i

714
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,639
so i trained at children's hospital

715
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,479
right here in la

716
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,759
and i gave grand rounds the month before

717
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,440
a covet hit

718
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,400
nobody from the neurology department

719
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,400
would come to my talk

720
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,319
okay yeah they they boycotted my talk

721
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,000
now it was standing room only but the

722
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,439
neurology department actually said to

723
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,480
the head of the hospital how is how are

724
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,080
you how are you even justifying this

725
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
this is what bothers me the literature's

726
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,079
there right the support is there so just

727
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,679
be aware that we're still in that uphill

728
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,798
battle despite looking at all this

729
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,320
research

730
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,158
all right and here's one that came out

731
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,240
looking at an observational cohort study

732
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,799
of epilepsy patients using this is

733
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,000
artisanal cbd so this is cbd from whole

734
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,679
plant

735
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,679
280 patients using cbd and 138 who did

736
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,159
not and compared to controls the cbd

737
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,080
users had higher quality of life lower

738
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,960
psychiatric symptoms severity better

739
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,000
sleep

740
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,079
better medication tolerability improved

741
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,679
health outcomes longitudinally use of

742
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,319
fewer prescriptions and reduced

743
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,080
healthcare utilization i i think i'm

744
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,839
beating a dead horse here right so i

745
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,798
think we've we've figured out what's

746
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,359
going on

747
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,158
now um dr russo mentioned this the other

748
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,558
day pamplona's study looking at cbd rich

749
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,400
cannabis extracts over purified cbd and

750
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,359
treatment resistant epilepsy

751
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,960
and this was a review of 11 sources with

752
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:01,359
670 patients pooled the cbd dosing range

753
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,400
was very wide 1 to 50 milligram per kilo

754
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,119
per day

755
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,200
and that just tells you about cbd's very

756
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,519
wide dosing if it doesn't work at a low

757
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,679
dose go up

758
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,240
and the treatment length on the mean was

759
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,159
six months 64

760
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,399
reported improvement in frequency of

761
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,679
seizures and there was more improvement

762
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:24,158
with the cbd extract 71 then with the

763
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,919
purified cbd at 46 and this was

764
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,919
statistically significant but if you

765
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,159
apply what's called the standard

766
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,919
clinical threshold of greater than 50 or

767
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,080
more reduction of seizures there was no

768
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,440
difference so then i ask you well if

769
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,918
there's no difference then what are we

770
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,320
going to do how do you choose

771
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,640
go ahead and look cbd extract patients

772
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,398
use a significantly lower dose six

773
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,480
milligram per kilo per day versus the

774
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,798
purified which is at 25 milligram per

775
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,640
kilo per day and in terms of the side

776
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,879
effect profile the side effect profile

777
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,640
for artisanal cbd was significantly

778
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,399
better than for uh purified cbd

779
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,640
i find the only reason that i'm

780
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,599
referring patients now to get the

781
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,278
purified cbd epidialex

782
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,519
and it is only approved for three

783
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,519
conditions right now which is um lennox

784
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,278
gastow syndrome dravet syndrome and

785
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,000
tuberous sclerosis

786
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:17,519
but they will you can get it off label

787
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,480
for other severe epilepsies

788
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,798
what i'm doing is when a patient needs a

789
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,360
very high dose like we're talking 1200

790
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,599
milligrams a day or 1600 milligrams a

791
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,158
day in some of my big teenagers

792
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,678
that is very difficult to afford so what

793
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,520
we do is

794
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,840
we will do some of the dosing as

795
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,359
epidiolex that is

796
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,439
they get help

797
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,278
it's part of the insurance company and

798
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,120
the other part we do with the whole

799
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,079
plant nobody ever said you can't mix

800
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,678
them so i do and it works out well so

801
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,519
the parents don't have such a high

802
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,840
financial burden

803
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,440
and so i initially wasn't too happy with

804
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,959
epidiolex because i don't like that

805
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,519
there's

806
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,000
alcohol and some sucralose in it which

807
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,359
is not great but at the same time if it

808
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,200
helps a family

809
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,038
with the burden of paying for a high

810
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,120
dose and keeps that child off a

811
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,759
multitude of other anti-epileptics it

812
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,439
certainly is the lesser

813
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,679
evil of of

814
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,440
epidiolex versus

815
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,600
other drugs so

816
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,759
all right and now let's move on to drug

817
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,119
drug interactions this was a big concern

818
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,960
when i first started doing this we

819
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,439
really didn't have any data so we were

820
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,360
super super careful with patients

821
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,000
this is a review of six trials looking

822
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,079
at the interactions between cannabidiol

823
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,240
and enzyme inducers or inhibitors and

824
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,480
common anti-seizure drugs

825
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,480
cbd in this study was or review of these

826
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,919
six trials was not found to affect the

827
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,839
cyp3a4 activity

828
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,799
except for the case of a drug called

829
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:50,398
clobazam clobazam the brand name is anfi

830
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:52,480
it's a pretty potent benzodiazepine

831
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,558
it's a heavy duty drug it causes a lot

832
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,480
of sedation and slowing down of a

833
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,639
child's brain but it can be quite

834
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,440
effective for seizures

835
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,919
when you mix cbd and clobazam cbd

836
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,679
clobazam is like is a drug in and of

837
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,919
itself but it's also a pro drug in that

838
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,000
when you take it your liver converts

839
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,159
clobazam to a secondary metabolite

840
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,640
called endosmethyl clobazam which is an

841
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:18,320
anticonvulsant in its own right but

842
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,120
endus methylclobazam is heavily sedating

843
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,918
cbd seems to drive the liver to convert

844
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,479
more clobazam to its metabolite endus

845
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,559
methyl so you can't just give somebody

846
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,960
extra of that second drug the liver has

847
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,879
to make that and so what happens when

848
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,319
they're taken together is there's an

849
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,640
increased exposure to the major

850
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,798
metabolites of both compounds which can

851
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,559
be beneficial for the patient because

852
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,158
now the patient's getting more of that

853
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,839
secondary metabolite which is

854
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,320
anticonvulsant and if they respond to

855
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,240
that sometimes by adding cbd and

856
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,038
boosting up that endos methyl you will

857
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,960
see

858
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,119
some improvement in seizures and you

859
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,880
don't know whether it's the cbd or the

860
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,359
other or both

861
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,760
sometimes you have to reduce the dosing

862
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,678
of clobazam because as you drive up that

863
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,079
secondary metabolite the patients can

864
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,399
get very sedated forty percent of

865
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,599
patients in the epidiolex trials require

866
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,119
dialing back of their omfi dose and so i

867
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,879
it doesn't happen right away it's not

868
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,879
like oh we upped the dose of cbd and the

869
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,080
next day the child sedated it is when

870
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,399
usually a week or two later

871
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,199
cbd and valproate so this is

872
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,798
valproic acid or depakote

873
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,720
there's been a lot of talk about that

874
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,639
because in the epidialex trials they put

875
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,600
in acute liver injury because they did

876
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,600
see

877
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:34,079
some elevation of the test looking at

878
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,000
liver function and liver enzymes

879
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,759
but in this review it did not cause

880
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
clinically important changes in the

881
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,599
pharmacokinetics of either i will tell

882
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,159
you that in my patient population

883
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,079
depakote is very popular being used by

884
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,760
many neurologists and those children

885
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,960
usually get blood work every six months

886
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,879
anyway i have yet to see any issues i

887
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,278
know in the

888
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,559
article that dustin and i co-authored

889
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,398
with

890
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,158
dr seneto out of seattle children's

891
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,038
hospital he's a neurologist he did not

892
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,640
see any changes in

893
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,879
liver tests and children taking

894
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,278
artisanal cbd and i just haven't seen it

895
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,200
it seems to be more so related to the

896
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,599
epidiolex i never say never i just

897
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
haven't seen it myself

898
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,798
only time i've actually ever seen

899
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,960
elevated

900
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,879
liver function tests in patients taking

901
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,600
very high dose cvd is in children who

902
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,039
are also on liver toxic chemotherapy so

903
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:26,879
that combination can cause that

904
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,720
elevation as well and so their

905
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,480
conclusion was quote these trials

906
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,480
indicate an overall low potential for

907
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,839
drug drug interactions between cbd and

908
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,839
anti-seizure drugs except for clobazam

909
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,319
all right now let's talk about delta9

910
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,480
thca which i'm going to call just thca

911
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,720
from now on it was first mentioned back

912
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,159
in 1979 in a mouse

913
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,720
model of

914
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,399
seizures and it was anti-convulsant at

915
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,278
200 milligram per kilo and then of

916
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:56,000
course there's many anecdotal reports

917
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,558
and i have many patients that take thca

918
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,640
as either their main anti-epilepsy drug

919
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,278
or as part of their regimen

920
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,559
a study that came out this year used

921
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:09,759
highly purified thca or a mixture of

922
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:12,240
thca and thc looking at mice that have

923
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,158
what's called dravet syndrome which is a

924
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,720
severe genetic

925
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,278
pediatric epilepsy very very difficult

926
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,679
to treat these children have heat and do

927
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,640
seizures i once had a patient my air

928
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,798
conditioning in my office was out and

929
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,640
the parents came walk came rolling into

930
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,000
my you know the child's in a wheelchair

931
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,960
i say rolling in

932
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,119
and they felt the temperature in my

933
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,720
office and said no way are we even

934
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,119
sitting in this room because she will

935
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,798
have a seizure so those kids are that

936
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,798
sensitive

937
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,480
um so um

938
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,319
the mixture was found to be

939
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,480
anti-convulsant in what's called the six

940
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,960
hertz uh threshold this is for partial

941
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,558
epilepsy this kind of test in the mice

942
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,038
and pretty much on everything else it

943
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,639
really uh didn't appear to work it's

944
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,240
always important to look at dosing and

945
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,000
what does purified mean does that mean

946
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,839
there really isn't any thc in there or

947
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,319
maybe there's still a little bit

948
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,798
because remember thca wants to change to

949
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,078
thc so it's very hard to study it all by

950
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,280
itself

951
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,599
but certainly in my uh in in clinical

952
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,320
practice thca does help a lot of my

953
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,919
patients and because it it's either has

954
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,679
a higher potency or because it's more

955
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,918
bioavailable

956
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,240
you can take a lower dose

957
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,960
it's easier to get into the body than

958
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,039
cbd now looking at cbda the first

959
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,878
published report of its anti-convulsive

960
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,559
activity was actually in a patent back

961
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,199
in 2019

962
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,799
looking at a mouse model of generalized

963
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,480
tonic-clonic seizures we think the

964
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,119
mechanism of action is enhanced

965
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,719
serotonin receptor activation which

966
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,679
appears to be even better than with cbd

967
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,439
and then

968
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,960
in this study which is again a mouse

969
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,320
model of dravet

970
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,119
the cbda brain plasma ratio in an oil

971
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,559
vehicle so this is cbd in just an oil

972
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,800
extract which is usually what's

973
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,759
available on the market

974
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,800
is

975
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,480
this low ratio suggests poor brain

976
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,400
penetration but the question is is it

977
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,880
hitting serotonin receptors in the gut

978
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,119
which is then talking to the brain

979
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,640
but the cbda they tried another vehicle

980
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,358
which was which is something called

981
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,118
tween 20 which is a non-ionic surfactant

982
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,838
emulsifying agent

983
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,800
that's often used to stabilize oil and

984
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:22,239
water

985
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,599
extractions or

986
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,000
preparations

987
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,599
the brain plasma ratio was much higher

988
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,599
and in this

989
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,119
with this product

990
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,559
they found it was anti-convulsant

991
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,800
against the heat induced seizures in

992
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,400
this dravay model

993
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,000
and then another study that came out

994
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,760
looking at the mouse what's called the

995
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,838
mes seizure this is for generalized

996
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,839
tonic clonic seizures they compared

997
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,358
three different products so look at the

998
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:47,119
first product that they labeled

999
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,719
chilobinoid that's what they called it

1000
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,200
so it's almost 75 cbda

1001
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,598
and has other minor cannabinoids and

1002
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,439
then they use magnesium as like this

1003
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,599
kind of a binder to help penetrate

1004
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,000
through the lipid layers and then they

1005
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,760
used a purified cbda and i want to point

1006
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,358
out to you that in the carlobinoid you

1007
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,359
see 75

1008
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,078
and in the second one you see not almost

1009
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,519
93 percent so the second one is a higher

1010
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,280
potency right

1011
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,119
and then they compared it to basically a

1012
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,880
cbd isolate

1013
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,320
and what they found was the kylobinoid

1014
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,920
was more effective

1015
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,838
than the uh kind of pure cbda

1016
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,920
in reducing seizures and this supports

1017
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,759
the entourage effect because if you the

1018
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,119
lower potency but with the minor

1019
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,960
cannabinoids

1020
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,280
uh seem to work better

1021
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,119
than the higher potency so that supports

1022
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,359
the idea that when you have that whole

1023
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,358
plant that you can actually let all

1024
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,400
those compounds do some of the heavy

1025
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,559
lifting

1026
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,960
for symptoms and then they also found

1027
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,119
that it was comparable to cbd i have

1028
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,800
started using cbda in my pediatric

1029
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,519
patients and i am seeing some of these

1030
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,079
patients have good results not only for

1031
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:57,280
lowering seizure frequency but also

1032
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,119
severity and duration as well as parents

1033
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,119
starting to report they feel like their

1034
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,280
child has less anxiety

1035
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,480
and also sleeping better so again it's

1036
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,160
hard to know when you're adding

1037
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,199
something into an already established

1038
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,598
regimen

1039
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,279
is it synergy is it that compound again

1040
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,200
very hard to know but when we're going

1041
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,200
in the right direction and by the way

1042
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,879
too i'm also seeing some good results in

1043
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:20,159
the kids who have autism who don't have

1044
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,119
epilepsy with cbda mostly the the most

1045
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,679
common

1046
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,960
report is my child's less anxious

1047
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:29,838
and so i'm finding that i've now kind of

1048
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,800
moved cbda up in the list of what to try

1049
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,239
a little bit higher uh priority

1050
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,200
all right and then let's just talk about

1051
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:39,199
thc for seizures everybody a lot of

1052
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,279
neurologists are telling patients oh thc

1053
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,799
causes seizures even a low dose and i

1054
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,800
just don't see that

1055
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,960
and we don't see that of being borne out

1056
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,960
by the research so in preclinical

1057
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,599
findings looking at six species and 34

1058
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,440
discrete animal models 21 studies found

1059
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,599
anti-convulsant effects

1060
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,720
one study pro-convulsant one mixed and

1061
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,440
11 studies didn't find any any effect on

1062
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,838
seizures a report from 2016 was

1063
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,039
observational looking at 292 adult

1064
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:09,119
patients 190 with epilepsy 64 with

1065
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,519
what's called psychogenic non-epileptic

1066
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,920
seizures and 26 with both these were

1067
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,199
patients who mostly inhaled about 1 gram

1068
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,079
a day

1069
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,759
84 of the patients using thc reported

1070
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,640
improvement in seizures it's a very high

1071
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,400
number

1072
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,639
almost 73 percent of the ones with

1073
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,320
psychogenic non-epileptic seizures are

1074
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:27,920
reported improvements

1075
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,000
and then here we have a study just from

1076
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,039
two years ago looking at retrospective

1077
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,599
reports of using thc in patients with

1078
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,920
um what i would call in track severe

1079
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,760
intractable epilepsy so a 21 year old

1080
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,280
with epileptic and this comes out of

1081
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,599
italy epileptic and encephalopathy since

1082
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,640
infancy the seizures went from 20 a

1083
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,280
month to seven a month with thc alone

1084
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,679
an 18 year old with west syndrome with

1085
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,760
another severe pediatric epilepsy since

1086
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,639
infancy reduction of seizures from 13 a

1087
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,800
day to two a day and this last one is

1088
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,199
amazing here 25 year old with juvenile

1089
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,880
absence epilepsy in rare

1090
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,559
maybe twice a year generalized

1091
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,280
tonic-clonic seizures went from 20

1092
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,920
seizures a day to only four a month very

1093
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,079
impactful uh for that uh for that

1094
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,838
patient and certainly for their family

1095
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,800
so we think the mechanism of action is

1096
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:21,279
decreases glutamate via cb1 activation

1097
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,000
i'm sure there's other mechanisms but i

1098
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,839
find thc to be very clinically helpful

1099
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,199
in my pediatric patients sometimes just

1100
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:31,400
adding a little bit reduces seizures

1101
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,439
and also if they're weaning off

1102
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,358
anti-epileptic drugs they're going

1103
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,760
they're going to have withdrawal those

1104
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,559
drugs are very difficult to get off of

1105
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,400
and i use low-dose thc parents we

1106
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,799
usually put the kids on some regular

1107
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,880
regimen maybe morning and night but i

1108
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,960
also tell the parents you can spot treat

1109
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,358
any time as needed treatment when you

1110
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,519
see your child having any difficulty and

1111
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,880
remember you don't have to stay on that

1112
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,639
that's something just to get them

1113
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,960
through the weaning

1114
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,319
and often parents seek benefits and say

1115
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,559
oh can we just make it part of the

1116
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,079
regimen and so it's just easier for them

1117
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:05,599
to have it part of the regimen

1118
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,839
day-to-day and then of course there is

1119
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,400
some tolerance that can occur if it's

1120
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,838
the only medication that's being used

1121
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,920
there's a little boy i take care of that

1122
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:15,119
has a multitude of medical issues and

1123
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,880
the only thing that's helped his

1124
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,358
seizures is thc

1125
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,880
but he's on a very high dose we're still

1126
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,480
getting good control but i'm a little

1127
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,760
afraid that we may lose the medicinal

1128
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,159
effect but we'll just have to wait and

1129
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,079
see what happens

1130
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,118
now we're going to switch to autism so

1131
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,920
the cdc now the latest numbers 1 in 44.

1132
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,960
it was 1 in 54 the last time i spoke in

1133
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,480
person so that's a little disheartening

1134
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,559
boys are four times

1135
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,800
more likely to be diagnosed than girls

1136
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,960
there are no approved medications to

1137
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,960
treat the core symptoms

1138
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,720
there are two fda approved medications

1139
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,199
that treat irritability they are

1140
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,480
atypical antipsychotics that have a lot

1141
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,318
of side effects

1142
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,280
also off-label medications like

1143
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,480
stimulants anti-depressants anti-anxiety

1144
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,079
drugs

1145
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,318
are being used

1146
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,480
but often have low efficacy and a risk

1147
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,239
of side effects new pharmaceutical

1148
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,480
studies show low efficacy except for

1149
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,000
crossover there was one study uh

1150
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,079
reported in this

1151
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,519
uh report this year that said all these

1152
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,160
other drugs aren't really working but

1153
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:18,400
the cannabinoid study shows promise so

1154
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,239
that's always good to be included and

1155
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,160
then we know these patients have more

1156
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,838
inflammation including neuroinflammation

1157
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:24,960
and gut issues

1158
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,440
so i'm going to speed up a little bit

1159
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,039
because i want to get to my research

1160
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,599
this is another

1161
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,279
graph just to look at when did we start

1162
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,200
seeing publications on autism and

1163
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,359
cannabis and it's not so long ago right

1164
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,598
2019 is really when it took off just a

1165
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,598
few reports before that so there's a lot

1166
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,359
of interest now and it's

1167
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,599
i think do one parents are going to use

1168
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:49,759
it they don't have a lot of choices and

1169
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,000
again safe well tolerated efficacious

1170
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,440
so let's look at this so we know that

1171
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,760
type 2

1172
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,039
receptors are upregulated in children

1173
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,319
with

1174
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:00,559
autism

1175
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:02,639
evidence of endocannabinoid system

1176
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,960
dysfunction and then we have a study

1177
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,960
from 2018 from stanford that measured

1178
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,318
plasma anandamide levels not an easy

1179
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,639
thing to do

1180
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,000
and they found that the anandamide

1181
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:14,879
endocannabinoid levels were

1182
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,559
statistically significantly lower in

1183
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,400
children with autism to the point where

1184
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,239
they could basically pick out the kids

1185
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,800
who had autism based on their blood work

1186
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,199
without looking at the child

1187
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,039
and another report out of israel lower

1188
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,519
circulating endocannabinoid levels in

1189
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,440
children with autism spectrum so now we

1190
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,199
can see that there is clearly some

1191
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,240
endocannabinoid dysfunction in these

1192
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,559
patients

1193
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:39,118
if you just compare a few studies that

1194
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,719
came out between 2018 and 2019 these are

1195
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,039
just all

1196
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:45,838
studies looking at children taking high

1197
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,838
cbd low thc preparations

1198
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,519
if you look there 20 to 1 mostly the

1199
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,920
very last one out of south america was

1200
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:53,519
75 to 1 ratio

1201
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,838
in this first study though they did add

1202
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,280
in thc if the patient did not have a

1203
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,759
good result with

1204
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,599
just the high cbd and they found 52

1205
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,599
percent improved on 20 to 1 and by

1206
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,599
adding in thc another 33 percent so this

1207
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,440
idea of no thc for these patients

1208
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,000
remember they're low in anandamide dr

1209
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,720
micholem teaches us over and over that

1210
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,960
anandamide and thc mimic each other and

1211
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:19,759
why would you leave a child deficient so

1212
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,199
i'm really anti-cbd only laws because

1213
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,960
that really limits

1214
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,639
um how um

1215
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,880
leaving a lot of patients out who could

1216
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,159
really benefit from cannabis medicine

1217
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,559
and then i'm just going to go through if

1218
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,559
you see in this first study 73 remained

1219
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,159
on treatment again satisfaction patient

1220
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,599
satisfaction right or at least parental

1221
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,239
satisfaction

1222
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,400
overall improvements in 75 percent

1223
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,959
82 plus per uh percent remained in

1224
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,400
treatment in this study and then 77.7

1225
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,880
remained on treatment and if you go

1226
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,680
through side effects mild mild mild and

1227
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,680
again in a study sometimes nobody's

1228
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,519
manipulating the medication to eliminate

1229
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,199
the side effect but certainly we do that

1230
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,639
in clinical practice

1231
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,318
and now i just want to talk about the

1232
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,078
last 15 minutes here talk about my

1233
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,800
research so i'm working with a group

1234
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,599
called campformatics and my two research

1235
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,440
partners are sitting here dr izak kurek

1236
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,800
and ken epstein

1237
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,838
and they approached me actually at a

1238
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,480
canmed conference a number of years ago

1239
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,318
and asking me to do research on what we

1240
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,280
call pharmacometabolomics it's a

1241
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:21,759
mouthful as well looking at the impact

1242
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,839
of medical cannabis on

1243
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,839
children who use

1244
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:27,519
medical cannabis to treat autism and we

1245
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,440
published two papers

1246
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,679
one at the end of last year and one just

1247
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,599
i think a month or two ago looking at

1248
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,559
what's called cannabis responsive

1249
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,119
biomarkers that we collect in saliva

1250
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:41,000
and so what are are these cannabis

1251
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,720
responsive biomarkers and what is

1252
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,519
pharmacometabolomics so basically what

1253
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:48,159
you're doing is you're just collecting

1254
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,000
chemicals from the body and you can use

1255
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,639
urine you can use blood you can use

1256
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,880
tissue you can we chose to use saliva

1257
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,639
and what you're looking at is this these

1258
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,280
compounds called that make up what's

1259
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:02,078
called the metabolome which is a group

1260
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,160
of compounds that allows us to see bio

1261
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,560
like the metabolites of the biochemical

1262
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,960
pathways so one of the ways to look at

1263
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,199
this is that if you look at your dna you

1264
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,519
can see what is potential but these

1265
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:16,559
biomarkers tell you actually what is

1266
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:18,559
going on in that human actual data as

1267
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,759
what their body is doing in terms of

1268
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:24,719
those pathways and so these biomarkers

1269
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,960
allow a clinician to kind of see where a

1270
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,879
patient is at baseline where they are

1271
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,039
after treatment if you stop treatment

1272
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,480
what happens and it allows you to see

1273
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,400
whether or not maybe

1274
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,119
there's a build up of a certain chemical

1275
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,000
that's causing toxicity it allows you to

1276
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,079
personalize treatment based on

1277
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,760
what we call the collecting it before

1278
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,839
treatment and then following after and

1279
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,280
it gives you numbers it gives you data

1280
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,920
not and i

1281
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,720
i'm the first person to argue what my

1282
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,639
the parents tell me is the truth they

1283
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,959
are struggling and they are trying to

1284
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,960
find an answer they do not lie

1285
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,440
especially with out-of-pocket costly

1286
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,280
medication when it's not working i hear

1287
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,280
about it okay so

1288
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,359
don't i always people say oh it's

1289
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,920
wishful thinking so they tell you

1290
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,598
that it's um it's better that is not

1291
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,200
true that is not my experience i'm sure

1292
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,720
the clinicians in the audience can tell

1293
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,879
you when patients are not it's not

1294
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:19,919
working they tell you but this actually

1295
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,838
gives us hard and fast objective data

1296
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,680
and so this is not new there are

1297
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,920
numerous studies that are published

1298
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,399
looking at metabolomics especially for

1299
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,240
autism and you can see here one that's

1300
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,119
looking at blood and one looking at

1301
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,118
urine and i don't know if if you tell a

1302
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,358
parent of a child with autism that you

1303
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,880
have to have to go get blood work they

1304
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,519
will look at you and say well you're

1305
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,760
going to go with my child i'm not going

1306
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:46,480
because that can be very very difficult

1307
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,319
these children have a lot of fear people

1308
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,199
come at them with needles and so on more

1309
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:53,519
so than just children without autism so

1310
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:57,039
it is nice to be able to collect saliva

1311
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:58,639
at home very easy the parents can do it

1312
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,119
and so what we did was he had 15

1313
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:02,799
children with autism who were on medical

1314
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,240
cannabis treatment that was deemed to be

1315
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,280
pretty successful

1316
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,118
pre meant we did a uh behavioral survey

1317
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,880
and saliva collection before they got

1318
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,400
their medical cannabis in the morning

1319
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,240
and you can see on the right what we did

1320
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,240
was no medical cannabis for at least

1321
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:18,399
eight hours and no food

1322
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,759
or high sugar drinks and then we had

1323
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,559
them rinse their mouth to try to

1324
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,880
minimize any noise in that in that

1325
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,800
saliva and then peak was the same thing

1326
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,720
a behavior survey done by the parents

1327
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,280
and then saliva collection 90 minutes

1328
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:33,439
after we had nine children typically

1329
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,200
developed who gave us saliva to

1330
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,119
establish what we call the physiologic

1331
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,960
range and we looked at what's called

1332
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,760
cannabis responsive biomarkers that

1333
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,159
measured different pathways so chemicals

1334
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,160
involved in neuronal dysfunction

1335
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,759
pain aggression and inflammation and

1336
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,679
again here is

1337
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,280
what the

1338
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,679
patient population looked like it was

1339
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,760
mostly boys when you look at dosage

1340
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,440
times per day some kids took one dose in

1341
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,440
the morning some took two throughout the

1342
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,119
day some took three

1343
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,559
edible or tincture edible just meant

1344
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,800
they were putting all these kids around

1345
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,880
tincture that they were putting their

1346
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,960
medicine into food and then swallowing

1347
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,559
it so and then you can see as i've shown

1348
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,480
you already the regimen was very

1349
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,599
different from most of these kids

1350
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,760
now this is the behavioral rating scales

1351
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,680
before so this is in the morning before

1352
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,400
they get their medical cannabis dose and

1353
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,799
so

1354
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,480
11 children were rated severe one child

1355
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,599
moderate and two children mild you can

1356
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,838
see red is kind of the severe scores and

1357
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,838
so you can see that this chart and by

1358
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,599
the way so along the top this is each

1359
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:37,759
child a1 is this one of the

1360
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:39,838
six-year-olds a2 a3 a4 and so on

1361
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,480
and and you can see what a heterogeneous

1362
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,880
group right so it's very different from

1363
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,119
child to child

1364
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,800
now looking this is after they took

1365
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,800
their medical cannabis and the behavior

1366
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,640
ratings so you can see a lot more blue

1367
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,119
right what we saw was 11 children

1368
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,719
improved two children had mixed response

1369
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,559
depending on the symptoms being asked

1370
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:01,279
about and two kids had bad days they

1371
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,440
just exhibited increased difficulties on

1372
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,359
that day and who knows maybe asking them

1373
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,599
to give saliva threw them off a little

1374
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:08,960
bit or you know they were just didn't

1375
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,838
get enough sleep the night before it's

1376
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:15,119
hard to know but overall we have uh

1377
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:16,880
predominant that patients were doing um

1378
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,559
it that they improved

1379
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,838
now let's look at this real quick so

1380
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,160
this is

1381
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:23,838
uh our typically developing group so you

1382
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,480
can see on the bottom one through nine

1383
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,960
those are our patients that gave saliva

1384
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,880
and uh overall this is their biomarkers

1385
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,039
and you can see they all kind of fall in

1386
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,160
within two standard deviations of each

1387
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:35,838
other right there's not a lot of

1388
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:36,719
variance in the typically developing

1389
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,400
children

1390
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:41,118
and if you go all the way to the right

1391
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,680
you can see the children with autism the

1392
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,599
dark blue that's where they fell for

1393
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:48,000
most of their biomarkers and then to the

1394
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,000
right as after you see the peak that's

1395
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,480
after cannabis

1396
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,639
and so you can see that it corrected and

1397
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,719
really what we say is it shifted towards

1398
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,400
the physiologic range

1399
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,279
right established by those children

1400
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,480
without autism so here's one example so

1401
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,160
n acetyl asper aspartic acid naa this is

1402
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,079
an abundant neurotransmitter and it

1403
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,159
reflects neurodensity and viability

1404
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,079
basically neuronal dysfunction

1405
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,000
and reading the research you can have

1406
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,680
low levels in autism you can have high

1407
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,920
levels and high functioning autism you

1408
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,679
really don't want it to be outside of

1409
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,079
that physiologic range because that

1410
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,000
indicates some neuronal dysfunction and

1411
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,160
what we saw was two distinct groups so

1412
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,318
if you look at the dark bars right the

1413
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,799
dark bars is they're either very

1414
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,639
significantly elevated or

1415
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,280
kind of close to the typically

1416
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:37,920
developing but in all cases the cannabis

1417
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,480
treatment modulated both groups towards

1418
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,880
the rain the physiologic range which

1419
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:47,358
suggests that the cannabis treatment is

1420
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,280
homeostatic if it's low it's coming up

1421
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:51,519
and if it's high it's coming down it's

1422
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,880
stabilizing so it's very fascinating you

1423
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,280
can see the in this um uh graft all the

1424
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,960
way to the right those are the uh that

1425
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,040
typically developing groups so you can

1426
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,039
compare and you can see the differences

1427
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,880
with before and after so this is very

1428
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,759
exciting and this is

1429
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,920
nice to see that it's not just anecdotal

1430
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,520
anymore that's very important and again

1431
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,680
this is preliminary study so i don't

1432
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:15,199
want to overstate but we were very

1433
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:16,719
excited with these results and here's

1434
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,639
just another way of looking at it this

1435
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,919
is three of our older kids

1436
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:23,679
so um the arrow pointing down that kind

1437
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,318
of teal arrow pointing down that's the

1438
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:28,399
physiologic mean and then minus two to

1439
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:30,239
plus two standard deviations which all

1440
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,400
of the children and typically developing

1441
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:34,558
fell within and you can see these are uh

1442
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,240
to the left is the list of biomarkers

1443
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,920
you can see all these biomarkers are

1444
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:39,118
kind of off the charts on these kids

1445
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,159
right

1446
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,519
and then

1447
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:43,039
i really like the slide because it

1448
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,199
really shows this is after medical

1449
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,000
cannabis this is amazing

1450
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:50,558
right to see that their biomarkers shift

1451
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,760
and it correlated with the behavioral

1452
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,920
survey

1453
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,280
so important

1454
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,519
all right and here's another one this

1455
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,760
comes from our second paper looking at

1456
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:02,000
lipid based

1457
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,000
salivary biomarkers so we had a lot of

1458
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,599
biomarkers to look at so we separated

1459
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,800
them and these are the lipid base these

1460
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,640
are

1461
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,559
compounds that are inherently involved

1462
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,639
with the endocannabinoid system as well

1463
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,760
so here you can see the patients

1464
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,598
are listed on the left a1 through a18

1465
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,079
and you can see the

1466
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,599
biomarker on the legend at the bottom

1467
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,720
the various

1468
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:27,280
sphingosines i think is that right

1469
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,039
and then again here you see after they

1470
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,599
take their medical cannabis so what we

1471
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,239
saw was that medical cannabis optimized

1472
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:38,000
levels of these biomarkers in 94 of

1473
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:40,799
patients so this is a tool to be used to

1474
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,239
help us personalize medicine

1475
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,480
finally after 26 years of

1476
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,799
trial and error we may be able to start

1477
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,039
using this tool at some point

1478
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,160
as we grow our

1479
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:53,759
database

1480
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,078
and then one last thing i want to show

1481
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,480
you is this predictive

1482
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,720
and again early data but if you look at

1483
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,400
the first patient as

1484
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,598
so these are all the biomarkers listed

1485
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,599
in gray

1486
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,680
and the first column which is mostly red

1487
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,760
that's our patient one of our oldest

1488
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,519
patients a 12 year old and what you can

1489
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,359
see is all those biomarkers are

1490
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,800
significantly out of the standard

1491
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,039
deviation

1492
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,920
and remember the light blue is optimal

1493
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:23,279
the dark blue is like um

1494
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,599
is bordering and then the red is way out

1495
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,079
and so what you can see is that the

1496
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,440
likelihood of this patient pre so this

1497
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,760
is at pre

1498
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,639
and what we determined was that this

1499
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,480
patient is 93 percent likely to respond

1500
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:38,960
to cannabis this would be a very helpful

1501
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,119
tool to be able to determine who to try

1502
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,800
cannabis in and who you may say you know

1503
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,720
what maybe you want to pursue another

1504
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,280
treatment because remember it's time

1505
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:50,639
consuming and it's costly

1506
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,000
and so this is a very nice

1507
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,960
early

1508
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,559
result that we're hoping that with more

1509
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,519
data collection that we'll be able to

1510
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,720
really see if we can

1511
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,880
justify

1512
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:06,318
checking a patient beforehand to see if

1513
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,079
there is some predictive value there

1514
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:09,519
these are our study limitations small

1515
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,000
sample size doesn't reflect the

1516
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:14,239
heterogeneity of autism

1517
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,318
unable to associate cannabinoid regimen

1518
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:17,679
with specific biomarker responses at

1519
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:19,440
this point although there was some

1520
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:21,440
signaling

1521
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,519
now some patients the parents

1522
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,358
after you're on you know cannabis for a

1523
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,119
while that parents know the dose so they

1524
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,279
kind of eyeball it with the eyedropper

1525
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,119
and i'm usually like really a stickler

1526
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,960
for that using that 1ml syringe so

1527
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,480
they're measuring it properly but

1528
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,639
it may have not been an accurate

1529
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,480
reflection of the dose and then in this

1530
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:40,400
study we gave equal impact to all the

1531
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,000
biomarkers because at this point we're

1532
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,599
still trying to sort out which ones are

1533
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,719
really important in this particular

1534
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:50,920
population of patients

1535
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:50,919
and that's it thank you very much

1536
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:01,519
[Applause]

1537
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:04,519
you have a question dr biermann

1538
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:04,519
yeah

1539
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:30,239
this is epilepsy

1540
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,239
right

1541
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:34,959
autism

1542
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:37,358
uh by the way you did a great job on

1543
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:40,798
that expert witness thing

1544
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:44,159
is um the um

1545
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:46,960
i have some patients that just get thc

1546
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,318
and a lot of improvement i'm thinking of

1547
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,760
two particular ones one was a

1548
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:53,838
nine-year-old girl she got 10 milligrams

1549
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,880
the parents and the teachers said she

1550
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,880
had a 30 improvement in one week and the

1551
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,640
other one was the grandson of a

1552
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,480
physician

1553
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:07,759
and he required 30 milligrams of thc

1554
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,480
twice a day and he lived in a uh

1555
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,000
residential living facility and when he

1556
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,679
ran out once they called me up and said

1557
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,679
hey hey it was in it was in a a a candy

1558
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,960
bar so will you will you rewrite it i

1559
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:23,759
did so uh i guess i put in a good word

1560
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,358
for thc and i want to know what

1561
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,400
what you think about it because these

1562
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:28,400
studies

1563
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,880
are all based on

1564
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,480
different doses and uh

1565
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,200
you know we don't know what

1566
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,719
actually causes some of these things

1567
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:38,719
and that's it

1568
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:41,439
thank you dr biermann so i agree with

1569
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:42,798
you thc is an incredible

1570
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,200
compound

1571
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:48,079
and we can no longer live in this world

1572
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:48,960
that tried to make it cbd good and thc

1573
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,039
bad

1574
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:55,358
no absolutely not thc can do what cbd

1575
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,838
cannot sometimes

1576
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:00,078
a lot of the parents that i see look i i

1577
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:02,000
could tell i can i hate to say this but

1578
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,519
i can pick out a cop and an attorney

1579
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,119
really easily

1580
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:06,798
i worked in the pediatric er for a

1581
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,720
really long time you start to understand

1582
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,639
personalities you know within about five

1583
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,639
minutes of walking into the room

1584
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,318
i've had fathers who come in you know

1585
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:15,759
they come in for the first consultation

1586
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:17,599
with their child having horrific

1587
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,240
seizures and

1588
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,680
when i bring up thc there's this

1589
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:23,519
what what

1590
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:25,598
like what are you doing and i'm like oh

1591
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,199
you're a law enforcement

1592
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,359
i can tell right away

1593
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:33,118
they truly have this it's been drilled

1594
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:35,598
into them right thc is useful th i

1595
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,559
always try to include thc the problem

1596
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,720
with thc right now believe it or not

1597
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,480
my patients are having a harder time

1598
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:46,000
accessing

1599
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,159
good quality low potency thc tinctures

1600
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,159
than before legalization

1601
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:51,679
yeah right

1602
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:52,838
what happened to all the good thc

1603
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:54,719
tinctures in

1604
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:56,639
california right they kind of

1605
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,719
disappeared there's like three companies

1606
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,960
that where you can measure one milligram

1607
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,959
two milligrams three milligrams there's

1608
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,960
a great product on the market it's 75

1609
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,240
milligrams per 1 ml

1610
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,519
how do i dose that 0.1 ml is 7.5

1611
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,039
milligrams

1612
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,838
i don't want to start with that dose in

1613
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:16,798
a three-year-old right so

1614
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:18,239
um i love thc i'm very upset that it's

1615
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,559
starting to become

1616
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:23,759
uh difficult to access for my patients

1617
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,680
because again dosing is key i these

1618
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,240
patients are that i take care of they

1619
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,719
are very complex and it can be the

1620
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,719
difference of like

1621
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:34,318
.05 mls on a syringe the difference

1622
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:37,118
between having a good day and having a

1623
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:40,079
bad day so we want to be able to measure

1624
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,559
the thc and know the dosing and keep up

1625
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,519
with that especially as they grow

1626
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,680
hi bonnie it's ethan great job

1627
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:50,000
um

1628
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,118
you'd mentioned a problem with sucralose

1629
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,159
and epidiolex was that related to its

1630
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,838
interference with the gut microbiome

1631
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,199
yes that's exactly what parents are

1632
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,519
concerned about because you know they'll

1633
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,118
go and read all the ingredients you have

1634
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:05,358
to remember a lot of these patients are

1635
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,160
kids that have mult a multitude of

1636
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:10,239
issues like mitochondrial disorders

1637
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,239
i have a patient who literally the mom

1638
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:15,358
tries one drop in the mouth and he's had

1639
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:18,239
bad reaction to one drop this is a

1640
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:20,000
child with what's called pans or pandas

1641
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,078
he has mitochondrial disorder he has

1642
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,519
autism and epilepsy and a multitude of

1643
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,039
other issues

1644
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,039
they hear sucralose and they go running

1645
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,400
in the other direction that's what it is

1646
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,159
and they're worried about the gut and

1647
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,680
they're worried about the liver

1648
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:34,480
because when you read about sucralose

1649
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:37,039
it's not exactly a liver friendly right

1650
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,318
and then just to comment and see

1651
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:39,279
what you think

1652
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,599
um

1653
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,798
you know i i was really struck by the

1654
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:47,519
carla study that pointed out that thca

1655
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:49,838
required an anti-convulsant dose of 200

1656
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:52,318
milligrams per kilogram per day and

1657
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:54,960
you're using nothing like that

1658
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:58,239
uh you know it really appears that the

1659
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,480
ramp model is no good uh rodents barely

1660
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:01,919
have a cerebral cortex

1661
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,000
thca

1662
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,119
does not appear to cross the blood-brain

1663
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,838
barrier when it's intact but in severe

1664
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:13,200
epilepsy it's not intact and that's why

1665
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:15,838
i think it works at these lower doses

1666
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,759
does that make sense to you i agree i

1667
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:20,159
think uh these patients that have

1668
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,000
excessive neural inflammation probably

1669
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,000
have a compromised blood-brain barrier i

1670
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,519
don't know how we're going to prove that

1671
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,280
i think the only way that we would be

1672
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:30,239
able to do that is to join up with a

1673
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,480
neurosurgeon who is doing uh surgery on

1674
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:35,039
either pediatric or adult patients who

1675
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,039
where they go in and they remove the you

1676
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,880
know the loci or the focus of where the

1677
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,639
seizures are coming from

1678
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,599
after the brain mapping is done and

1679
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:46,239
maybe we can try to get to look at some

1680
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,640
uh the blend barrier and see if we can

1681
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:50,719
find out if it's uh compromised i don't

1682
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:54,920
know of any other way to do it in humans

1683
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:54,919
sure thank you thank you

1684
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:02,000
hi dr goldstein catalano here um for

1685
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:04,798
your patients with autism you who you

1686
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,960
said reported about a 75

1687
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,719
improvement what sorts of uh clinical

1688
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,639
outcomes were you

1689
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:13,039
were you looking at for them yeah great

1690
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:15,759
question so we look at aggression

1691
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,920
we look at self-injurious behavior

1692
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,559
we look at ability to transition from

1693
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,599
one act activity to another that's a big

1694
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,920
thing

1695
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,200
uh you know i've had parents who tell me

1696
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,960
their kids are getting thrown out of

1697
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:28,639
school because they the child can't go

1698
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,639
from one activity to another and throws

1699
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:32,558
a chair at the teacher trying to move

1700
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:33,679
from one activity to another

1701
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,359
sleep

1702
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:38,078
and then one of the biggest ones is

1703
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:41,440
anxiety kids with autism suffer suffer

1704
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:43,760
some terrible anxiety it's just

1705
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,880
i call them ferraris going down the

1706
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,640
freeway at the with you know um what is

1707
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,400
that pedal to the metal

1708
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:52,400
and remember a lot of the drugs that

1709
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,798
we're using for these patients just kind

1710
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,559
of put them parked we don't want that we

1711
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:58,400
just want them to go speed limit right

1712
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,720
we want them to be able to function and

1713
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,480
integrate into a classroom and learn and

1714
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,159
basically what we want is them to reach

1715
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,400
their potential and a lot of these kids

1716
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,000
are written off they're non-verbal

1717
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,000
and maybe they're not following

1718
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,519
directions or they're super anxious and

1719
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,519
people write them off as you know

1720
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:15,199
intellectually disabled and the vast

1721
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:16,960
majority of my patients are not

1722
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:18,798
intellectually disabled they can get the

1723
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,559
work done they can learn

1724
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:22,559
i have a patient right now who's 11

1725
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,880
years old who has the vocabulary of a

1726
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:25,839
phd student i mean he's amazing when he

1727
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,599
types

1728
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:30,078
but he gets no credit for anything

1729
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,480
because he has all of this other stuff

1730
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,880
that it when people see it they just go

1731
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,559
oh yeah you know he's not even worth the

1732
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,200
time of day and

1733
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:41,200
he has done incredibly well on cannabis

1734
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,679
so he was a child who

1735
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:45,759
actually had such severe self-injurious

1736
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,440
behavior he broke his own arm

1737
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,400
and i mean this is what people are

1738
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,559
dealing with and so um when we look at

1739
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,200
these behaviors you're basically scaling

1740
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:57,440
irritability and aggression and

1741
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:59,038
uh anxiety and so on

1742
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,960
does that answer your question it does

1743
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,559
thank you and have a second question if

1744
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,720
i can sure

1745
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:06,559
when you integrate the how do you

1746
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,239
integrate the medical cannabis regimen

1747
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,599
when they're already on other

1748
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:12,399
medications when they're on their

1749
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,240
medication yeah so i leave medication

1750
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,480
alone for the most part

1751
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:17,679
and i start with the cannabis and i just

1752
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,280
say we're just gonna i know you're

1753
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:20,719
anxious to wean it but let's just leave

1754
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,000
it alone because if you start weaning

1755
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:24,078
and you're adding cannabinoids and

1756
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,079
something goes south you don't know

1757
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,240
what's what so my general rule of thumb

1758
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,440
is one change at a time occasionally i

1759
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:31,038
break that rule

1760
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,039
but what i'll do is i'll usually just

1761
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,480
based on the patient's symptoms if

1762
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,960
they're very aggressive or

1763
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,519
self-injurious or not sleeping at night

1764
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,960
i will lean more towards like a cbd thc

1765
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,960
low ratio

1766
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:46,240
if it's a child who's not having a lot

1767
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:49,119
of that aggression or self-injurious um

1768
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:51,358
or is still is sleeping okay i'll lean

1769
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,119
towards more of a high cbd low thc

1770
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:55,519
because about half the kids will respond

1771
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,200
with that and i was going to say i was

1772
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:58,798
going to say this with dr biermann asked

1773
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,879
me about thc

1774
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,079
my point about saying there's not a lot

1775
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,000
of thc

1776
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,839
um uh

1777
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,480
preparations out there that are are

1778
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:10,078
useful now for pediatrics there's some

1779
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,519
i have parents like waiting for a

1780
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,079
dispensary to call them that they got

1781
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:15,838
the product in and there's people here

1782
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,200
who live on that side where i text them

1783
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:19,038
and say are you are you going to get

1784
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,960
this in because these people ran out and

1785
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,480
they're using something else and the kid

1786
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,838
lost a week of his life because he

1787
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,440
couldn't go to school because all his

1788
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:27,358
behaviors came back because he doesn't

1789
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,838
have the proper medicine

1790
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,519
cbd from the hemp world if you know you

1791
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,119
look at the coas and you follow

1792
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:36,079
companies for a while there's a lot of

1793
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,920
good cbd out there and the parents can

1794
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,880
order it online or go pick it up at the

1795
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,400
local

1796
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,318
health food store

1797
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,240
and it just makes it so much easier and

1798
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:46,639
in california they're not paying that

1799
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,798
crazy high state tax along with the

1800
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:50,639
other taxes that go with it so as much

1801
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:53,119
as i can i do try to incorporate

1802
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:55,038
products that are from the hemp market

1803
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,960
because it's just easier for the

1804
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,480
families right

1805
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:02,159
but if something needs to come from the

1806
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,559
dispensary so that's thc thca and any of

1807
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:06,399
the low ratios it makes it a little more

1808
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,798
difficult for families but basically i

1809
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,280
just try to go through each

1810
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:13,519
cannabinoid and i

1811
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,680
we didn't really talk about this but cbg

1812
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:17,679
is a very helpful cannabinoid in autism

1813
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,519
it's anti-inflammatory i have patients

1814
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:20,558
who've become verbal on it

1815
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,038
i see

1816
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,720
focus with cbg

1817
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,240
and again what are the mechanisms you

1818
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:28,719
know we heard some lectures today about

1819
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:31,118
cbg certainly a wonderful cannabinoid

1820
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:32,959
easily accessed by parents as well right

1821
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,400
on the hemp market you can i i don't

1822
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,838
know if you can get it in a dispensary i

1823
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,440
don't think so

1824
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:39,519
so

1825
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,760
the whole idea behind the regimen takes

1826
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:43,838
into all these factors right it's just

1827
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,000
not one size fits all i try to start

1828
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:48,719
with what the patient's needs are

1829
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,798
where the family lives their access

1830
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:52,078
their lifestyle do they travel a lot

1831
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:54,079
because again you're not going to be

1832
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,519
traveling all over the world with thc

1833
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,359
because that might get confiscated and

1834
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:59,119
then you're stuck somewhere without it

1835
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:01,279
so there's a lot of things that go into

1836
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,200
how you create a

1837
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,798
regimen for a patient but it is

1838
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,239
basically rule it in or rule it out if

1839
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,318
something works we keep it and then we

1840
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,318
move on to the next i usually don't wean

1841
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:11,920
drugs for at least i'd like to see a few

1842
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:13,279
months of stability

1843
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,400
and when you get that improvement

1844
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,960
parents always say how am i going to

1845
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,838
know i'm like you know you know your

1846
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,199
child right so we all know our loved

1847
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:23,358
ones we know when they're having a good

1848
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:24,879
day and a bad day and so if you watch

1849
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,960
over time after a few months and the

1850
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,480
child's doing well you can start to wean

1851
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,559
don't be surprised if you have to give

1852
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,358
more thc while you're weaning a drug or

1853
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,359
more cbd because sometimes it is doing a

1854
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:37,838
little bit for the patient or just

1855
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:39,199
removing it you have to start you know

1856
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:41,199
it throws them out of balance and you

1857
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:44,399
have to get back into balance

1858
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,399
thank you very much you're welcome

1859
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,280
hi uh marley colt i'm from utah but i

1860
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,038
asked you a question yesterday and i

1861
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,798
think that your answer was just

1862
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:54,240
phenomenal and i think everyone could

1863
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:56,079
benefit from it

1864
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:58,959
so your

1865
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,960
opinion on medical cannabis inhalation

1866
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,639
for children and how

1867
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,159
young they can inhale for acute symptoms

1868
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:09,679
obviously we don't want them smoking a

1869
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:11,759
joint or a bong or something but still

1870
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:15,279
would you prefer them try vape

1871
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,920
cartridges and or a dry herb vaporizer

1872
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:20,079
um yeah just elaborate on that so my

1873
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,318
experience with vaping in children is

1874
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,760
pretty extensive so i have a handful of

1875
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:27,119
pediatric

1876
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,880
epilepsy teenagers who get auras which

1877
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,920
is the sensation that a seizure is

1878
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:35,599
coming and if they vape thc

1879
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,599
or a one to one cbd thc it stops the

1880
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,359
seizure from happening and that has i've

1881
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,838
seen it over and over in certain

1882
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:42,880
patients so i have no problem with them

1883
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:45,920
using

1884
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,838
an uh vaporizer and either it there's a

1885
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,838
i don't want to endorse a company here

1886
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:51,920
there's a company here that if you take

1887
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:53,358
a puff the device

1888
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,119
vibrates kind of like your phone

1889
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:57,519
vibrates and that's like about two and a

1890
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,200
half milligrams depending on the makeup

1891
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,440
and a lot of parents like that because

1892
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:03,439
they know oh okay it's kind of close to

1893
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,760
do it's a dose right they're not just

1894
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:08,838
not sucking on the thing and then i do

1895
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:11,760
have uh some patients who have

1896
01:08:08,838 --> 01:08:14,480
rage with autism they're aware of their

1897
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,960
rage they know that they get into this

1898
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,679
you know kind of escalated

1899
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,079
they feel that anxiety and they will ask

1900
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,560
for a take a puff they will go to their

1901
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:25,920
parent and they either use a

1902
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,239
flower

1903
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,560
vaporizer with flour or they'll use one

1904
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:32,798
of these other vape cartridge devices i

1905
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,839
have not seen any issues in these

1906
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:36,399
patients

1907
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:38,318
using inhaled for

1908
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:41,358
basically rescue think about right we're

1909
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:43,600
rescuing it's rescue medicine so

1910
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,679
this is not unusual in epilepsy there's

1911
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,520
nasal rescue medication there's rectal

1912
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,279
valium there's all kinds of rescue

1913
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,199
medicine out there so

1914
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,719
certainly there's no reason that we

1915
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:55,119
can't use this and it is quite

1916
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,880
successful now when you ask me the age i

1917
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:58,798
don't think i've ever had anybody under

1918
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,560
eight use a vaporizer i'm not sure

1919
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:04,319
dustin have you had any patients younger

1920
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:06,560
than eight no yeah so um i you know they

1921
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,359
have to be able to do it now i do have a

1922
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,159
family and i showed them on tuesday this

1923
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,920
uh

1924
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:14,079
brother's sister so the brother has

1925
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,838
epilepsy autism cyclical vomiting

1926
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:18,238
syndrome and a genetic abnormality he's

1927
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:19,600
done incredibly well he's in my book his

1928
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:22,318
name is gavin

1929
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,000
and when he gets a cyclical a cyclical

1930
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,719
vomiting episode the parents have a

1931
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,520
volcano vaporizer they have homegrown

1932
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,319
gran uh what is it granddaddy purple

1933
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,560
and

1934
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:35,359
they put him in the bathroom

1935
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,440
and they ramp up their volcano

1936
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,199
this has they've been able to avoid

1937
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:42,238
emergency room

1938
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:44,158
i mean they were at the er every month

1939
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:47,119
for the longest time and he's on high

1940
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:48,399
dose cbd and thc whatever it is that

1941
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:50,559
triggers him

1942
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:52,960
when it goes it goes

1943
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,920
and so this has really helped

1944
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:59,119
his sister when she got covid had a

1945
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,279
seizure first seizure in four years

1946
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:03,599
and she caught it at school even with

1947
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:05,119
the mask on and she

1948
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,719
had her seizure

1949
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:08,640
and she seemed like she was going to

1950
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,800
cluster a little bit so i said go ahead

1951
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,880
and just use the volcano on her

1952
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,199
and she recovered she didn't have any

1953
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,400
further seizures no clusters no nothing

1954
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:20,399
i mean it works now they both don't like

1955
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:21,519
it they scream bloody murder and that's

1956
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:22,639
why they go in the bathroom because they

1957
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,719
don't want the neighbors calling the

1958
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,640
cops that the kids are getting

1959
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:28,399
but they don't like the device over you

1960
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,800
know so what they did was they took the

1961
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:33,439
volcano and they kind of rigged up a

1962
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,119
little pediatric oxygen mask to it and

1963
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:37,599
there is a video online that you can see

1964
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:40,399
a patient in texas who's very well known

1965
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,560
a young lady with severe autism is very

1966
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:44,559
self-injurious and her parents have the

1967
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,560
volcano always ready to go and they just

1968
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,760
kind of got some tubing they got a

1969
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,080
pediatric

1970
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,640
mask and they give her the vape and you

1971
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,479
see her very unhappy to very happy very

1972
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,079
quickly so i think it's something that

1973
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:57,359
we cannot disregard it's something that

1974
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:59,760
should be included in many of these

1975
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:02,158
pediatric cases

1976
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:05,360
yeah thanks a lot for the presentation i

1977
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:09,198
just want uh to uh we might clarify your

1978
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:10,839
comment regarding uh the effects of cbd

1979
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:13,439
on the patient

1980
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,279
uh microbiome

1981
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:17,678
uh because i i sort of hear you were

1982
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:20,319
saying something regarding the

1983
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:24,158
uh susceptibility of the patient

1984
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:25,599
uh due to uh mitochondria so that i

1985
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:27,599
would just you know key with someone

1986
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,079
sorry i don't understand the question

1987
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,480
uh the question like what does cbd do to

1988
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:34,719
the microbiome yeah what is this well by

1989
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:37,599
enhancing so remember cbd enhances your

1990
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,880
end i mean cbd has a as tons of targets

1991
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,280
in your body

1992
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,039
in autism patients in autism and then

1993
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:45,119
the first part and the second part of

1994
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:48,238
the question is uh we have a panel

1995
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:50,880
earlier today that talk about uh how uh

1996
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:52,799
regulation in different state in this

1997
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,960
country now right now there is no

1998
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,920
difference in guinea you know across

1999
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:00,640
this country for microbial contaminant

2000
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,640
testing for recreational and medical

2001
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,960
cannabis i was just wondering if you

2002
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,719
have any insight you know moving forward

2003
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,880
should there be a different guideline

2004
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,399
for medical cannabinoid recreational

2005
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,679
cannabis thank you right oh that's a

2006
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,439
good question i don't know that i'm the

2007
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,719
right person to ask to answer that

2008
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:16,719
second question

2009
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,560
i would say i will tell you that so far

2010
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:20,399
i haven't had anybody get sick even in

2011
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,000
the unregulated market because we're

2012
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,158
always very careful with pediatric

2013
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,840
patients we we never really use a

2014
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:28,559
product unless the parents doing it like

2015
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,079
went rogue and is doing it on their own

2016
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,440
for me it's a deal breaker if i don't

2017
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,600
have a coa

2018
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:36,000
that's it so i have a coa so i can

2019
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,719
always see what the patient is on and we

2020
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,560
can also look at batch to batch to see

2021
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:44,560
if there's any change you know early on

2022
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,400
back in 2008 or i should say really 2013

2023
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,159
i had patients that would start with one

2024
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:50,479
product and get great results and go

2025
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:53,198
right back to the same company or the

2026
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:55,439
same cultivator processor and get the

2027
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:56,799
oil exactly labeled exactly the same

2028
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:58,639
thing and they say oh my child's not

2029
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,400
responding anymore it's not the same but

2030
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,560
it's different it's a different team of

2031
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:03,759
r d it was made different we don't even

2032
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,440
know what's in there we have to get a

2033
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,520
coa and that's when i started looking at

2034
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:09,198
coas was very early on

2035
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,600
when my patients were getting very

2036
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:13,439
inconsistent results um in terms of the

2037
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,159
microbiome that's like a whole lecture

2038
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,479
and i would refer you to ethan russo's

2039
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,158
paper and also to the care and feeding

2040
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:22,158
but basically

2041
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:24,559
remember cbd enhances your

2042
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:26,158
endocannabinoid system by allowing

2043
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,120
anandamide to hang around a little

2044
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:32,079
longer it blocks the um breakdown of an

2045
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:35,119
andamide or encourages that pathway and

2046
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:36,479
so by establishing uh an enhanced

2047
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,158
endocannabinoid system i mean that's the

2048
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:40,718
whole idea behind cannabis is that we're

2049
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:43,839
augmenting the endocannabinoid system to

2050
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,840
get it back into balance

2051
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:47,679
hi um

2052
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,000
so

2053
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:52,800
about 10 years ago i was having all

2054
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,359
these ibs symptoms and so i started

2055
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,520
reading about people juicing

2056
01:13:55,359 --> 01:14:00,319
and um

2057
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:02,640
so i decided i would juice and this was

2058
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:04,880
before i was going into the office and i

2059
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,679
figured oh it's thca i'll be i'll be

2060
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,239
fine

2061
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:11,440
because it was fresh material

2062
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:14,158
and i ended up getting really stoned and

2063
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:15,799
i was like what the hell is happening i

2064
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,000
figured oh there must be some

2065
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,039
decarboxylated material

2066
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,279
in here

2067
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:23,439
and so i tried it again

2068
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:26,639
i got stoned again and

2069
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:29,519
anyway it led me to question whether in

2070
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,679
people with certain acidic

2071
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,239
uh stomach conditions

2072
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:38,000
uh whether there could be thca

2073
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:41,519
essentially decarboxylating in the gut

2074
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,079
and um ethan's question about

2075
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,199
you know why thca appears to maybe be

2076
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,158
effective

2077
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:46,799
um

2078
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:48,399
and

2079
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,960
you know the hypothesis that maybe it

2080
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:52,719
has to do with the uh blood brain

2081
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,800
barrier you know

2082
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:57,039
having a break a breakdown in these

2083
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:00,079
kinds of patients i think we might also

2084
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:02,238
look at variability in terms of ph

2085
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:04,238
levels in the gut of these patients

2086
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:06,639
because obviously we know

2087
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:08,319
that ph is associated with microbiomes

2088
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:11,760
et cetera so i'm wondering if you've if

2089
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:13,119
you've seen anybody take thca and get

2090
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,840
high

2091
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:18,000
and um second whether you think that

2092
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,640
that might be a a good

2093
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,039
hypothesis for somebody to pursue now

2094
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,719
that i'm not in the cannabis game i'd

2095
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:26,880
love to see somebody pursue that

2096
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:29,039
research well i think it's already been

2097
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,520
done and i think that we've discounted

2098
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:34,158
that it does not appear that thca

2099
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:37,120
converts to thc in the body and nor does

2100
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:39,039
cbda convert to cbd in the body

2101
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:41,359
so that those i could look up those

2102
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:44,319
references and share that with you um in

2103
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:46,719
terms of getting high on thca sure i've

2104
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:49,359
had patients get high on what's reported

2105
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:50,800
to be thca because remember by the time

2106
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:53,679
my patients get it they're usually not

2107
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,960
using whole plant or raw or

2108
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,399
plant material it's usually been

2109
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,079
processed somewhere along the line and

2110
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:00,079
depends on how long it was sitting on a

2111
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,719
shelf what the was it kept in a

2112
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:05,039
refrigerator did it get exposed like was

2113
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:07,119
it sitting in a truck where it sat

2114
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:09,439
outside a distribution center in the hot

2115
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:11,599
southern california weather so it's hard

2116
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:14,238
to know because there will be conversion

2117
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:17,039
in that bottle there's always some thca

2118
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:18,959
i'm sorry thc in a bottle of thc

2119
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:20,719
we just don't know how much now there's

2120
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,600
one product that i've been using with my

2121
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,880
patients that's like a 20 to 1 thca to

2122
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,039
thc

2123
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,760
but there's also products out there that

2124
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:33,039
have thca and cbd there's products out

2125
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:34,640
there that have thca one to one with thc

2126
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:36,079
so we have to read labels you have to

2127
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,400
know what you're getting and i highly

2128
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:40,559
recommend keeping it in a refrigerator

2129
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:42,158
if it's not in a dark bottle put it in a

2130
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,360
dark bottle or wrap it in tin foil

2131
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:44,719
because every time you open and close

2132
01:16:43,359 --> 01:16:46,079
the refrigerator there's some light

2133
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:49,760
getting in so

2134
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:52,238
in order to maintain it as close to as

2135
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,920
like when you purchased it but again

2136
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:55,519
before buying it in a dispenser you have

2137
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,000
no idea what happened to it so it

2138
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,520
certainly could contain a lot of thc

2139
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,520
and that's why i always tell patients to

2140
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:04,239
always start with a low dose i'm not

2141
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,120
sure why you became so intoxicated maybe

2142
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,759
you're

2143
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:10,399
maybe dustin has a you have a qui an

2144
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,400
answer dustin

2145
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,960
um

2146
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:18,000
yeah it i i suppose it could have been

2147
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:20,000
cavitation from from juicing i you know

2148
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,920
i was lucky enough to have access to a

2149
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,479
mass spec and so i

2150
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:28,079
took what i had and i

2151
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:30,639
looked at it and it was thca wow so um i

2152
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:32,559
i think that the the and i'm familiar

2153
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,440
with the data that you're talking about

2154
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:38,880
um i don't think that that data uh at

2155
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:41,439
all accounted for uh people with um

2156
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,239
gut conditions specifically yeah there's

2157
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:46,319
probably some variability sure yeah so i

2158
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:48,319
think that there's potentially a ph

2159
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:51,679
issue happening because when i tried the

2160
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:54,479
thca when i wasn't in an acute um

2161
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:56,158
you know episode i it didn't get me high

2162
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,678
yeah that's interesting

2163
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,119
and i tell people like i have parents

2164
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:00,158
that say is this going to make my child

2165
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:01,679
high or is it going to make them

2166
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:03,759
agitated is this going to make them calm

2167
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:05,920
i say all bets are off don't guess just

2168
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,760
try it and see because it's very hard to

2169
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,239
guess with cannabis

2170
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,480
right it's a it's polypharmaceutical to

2171
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:14,158
start with right too many there's lots

2172
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,439
and lots of compounds we want them all

2173
01:18:14,158 --> 01:18:17,279
in there but you just don't know which

2174
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:18,799
person's going to be sensitive to what

2175
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:21,039
and then you know last night listening

2176
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,119
to daddy speak you know he found these

2177
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:25,119
go to sleep one and go to sleep too

2178
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:27,198
we're not even accounting for all of the

2179
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:29,760
compounds that we have no idea

2180
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:31,519
right and that and but i

2181
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,520
really believe again

2182
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,080
the um

2183
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,320
the information we have at this time is

2184
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:40,319
that cannabis is safe it's well

2185
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:42,799
tolerated and i don't really have any

2186
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:44,559
qualms about treating pediatric patients

2187
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,800
with it especially under medical

2188
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,199
supervision because really things don't

2189
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,119
go south too often so

2190
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:52,079
thank you for your question

2191
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:54,000
thank you

2192
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:56,158
excuse me thank you bonnie for all your

2193
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,880
work with pediatrics uh you and i share

2194
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:01,439
that field uh um but i had a question uh

2195
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,440
twofold um with the biomarkers that you

2196
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:06,960
saw is uh you think that might help with

2197
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:09,439
early detection of autistic children and

2198
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,840
also um

2199
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:13,519
would we look at maybe dosing these

2200
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,760
children early on

2201
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,920
very early ages and will we slow down

2202
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,640
the progression of autism or at least

2203
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,560
help

2204
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,800
with development yeah great questions

2205
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,960
thank you so yes i do think that these

2206
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,719
can be used as biomarkers once we have

2207
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,679
more data and we're able to really see

2208
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:31,760
which ones are very highly elevated and

2209
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:33,520
are consistently elevated across

2210
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,280
remember it's a spectrum disorder so we

2211
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,600
want to be able to have the best idea of

2212
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:39,198
which biomarkers correlate the best i

2213
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,199
absolutely think that would be great and

2214
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:43,839
i mentioned this the other day that you

2215
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:47,198
might be able to use plasma anandamide

2216
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:49,600
levels as a bio as a

2217
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:51,839
biomarker for autism as well so there

2218
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,560
are a number of things that we can look

2219
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,400
at maybe we do anandamide and biomarkers

2220
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,159
and we see if there's some correlation

2221
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:00,799
there as well i'm sorry what was your

2222
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:00,799
second question

2223
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:06,239
oh right

2224
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,480
yeah i do think starting them earlier uh

2225
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,319
would be helpful and someone might say

2226
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:12,000
how early i mean the youngest patient

2227
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:13,439
i've ever treated was a six week old

2228
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,560
with a severe

2229
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:16,479
genetic

2230
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,280
seizure disorder that was likely having

2231
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:21,759
seizures in utero i couldn't treat them

2232
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:23,679
until i had the diagnosis at six weeks

2233
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,600
is when the genetics came back and we

2234
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:27,359
started treatment and that child did

2235
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,480
fairly well it was a devastating

2236
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:32,079
metabolic syndrome so i don't know how

2237
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:33,279
good we're going to be able to get that

2238
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:34,960
child but i certainly wasn't going to

2239
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:36,880
wait and let him continue to have he's

2240
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,679
having hundreds of seizures on his eeg a

2241
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,520
day

2242
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,199
and you know and then what are you going

2243
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:43,760
to are you going to give a six-month-old

2244
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:46,719
a multitude of um

2245
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,400
anti-epileptic drugs i mean

2246
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,880
right do no harm

2247
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:52,079
um so he did okay i mean he had much

2248
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,760
less seizures we never got him

2249
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:56,158
seizure-free and it's not

2250
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,159
it the this group of patients that have

2251
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:00,319
refractory epilepsy look i have had

2252
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:02,638
patients that have tried up to 22

2253
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:04,719
different anti-epileptics you're talking

2254
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:07,119
about a long time to try these you're

2255
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:09,359
losing brain cells as you go

2256
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:11,039
to me if you're really hardcore and want

2257
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:11,920
to try one or two go right out of the

2258
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:14,000
gate

2259
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,239
but i do always think that it's worth a

2260
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,158
conversation in the beginning why not

2261
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:20,959
use the benign plan

2262
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:23,519
now that we have so much data why not

2263
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,880
try it what if your child is the child

2264
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,639
that's going to respond and you don't

2265
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,560
have to go down that pathway of those

2266
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:30,400
hardcore drugs that do cause a lot of

2267
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:34,400
somnolence and

2268
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:34,399
all all other kinds of side effects

2269
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,119
hi well thank you for all your work

2270
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:41,279
first of all uh my question was

2271
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:43,279
regarding the marker for your research

2272
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:44,880
study on about sleep

2273
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:47,759
how do you guys measure the sleep

2274
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:50,400
efficiency in autistic children was that

2275
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,639
a study that i quoted for sleep i i

2276
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:54,399
believe you asked actually yo you

2277
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,359
answered the question about the markers

2278
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:56,960
and one of your markers for your

2279
01:21:55,359 --> 01:21:59,359
research study was sleep for the

2280
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,399
improvement remember which one it's talk

2281
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:02,880
do you have

2282
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:05,039
did we have a biomarker for sleep

2283
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,880
no i think it was inflammation pain

2284
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:08,238
neuronal dysfunction

2285
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,359
okay sorry i thought you mentioned sleep

2286
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:11,839
so i was just wondering if it was

2287
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:13,599
polysonography or it was uh actually

2288
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:17,199
sleep diaries yeah it's a good question

2289
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:18,239
i i did mention sleep in one of the eeg

2290
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,719
reports

2291
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:23,198
and what they did was they had

2292
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:25,119
the children or the patients in that

2293
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:26,079
report did where the eeg suit through

2294
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:27,840
sleep

2295
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:30,399
and so they did have

2296
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,600
brain waves looking at the quality of

2297
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:33,759
the sleep and what they call the

2298
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,760
microstructure and it was like something

2299
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,360
over 75 percent of those patients had

2300
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,840
improvement in their sleep micro

2301
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:41,839
microstructure based on an eeg

2302
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,760
okay okay okay was that just a portable

2303
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,039
unit probably right yeah okay

2304
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,000
yes i'm not sure where they did that

2305
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:49,279
yeah

2306
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,079
hi again thank you amazing work

2307
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:52,800
um

2308
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:54,960
the gut microbiome being so important

2309
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,960
are any of these kids following a

2310
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,800
special diet like a

2311
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,960
low-carb

2312
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,520
vegetable-rich diet or is that just

2313
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,639
impossible no it's not impossible it's

2314
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,719
you know

2315
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:08,880
it's hard when you have a special needs

2316
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,560
child to then also control everything

2317
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,480
that goes into their mouth

2318
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,199
especially when they are super super

2319
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:17,279
super picky yeah and they have problems

2320
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:19,839
with textures and so on

2321
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:21,840
um some of my patients are gluten-free

2322
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,600
dairy-free sugar-free

2323
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,319
and some are

2324
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,760
the exact opposite and come in my office

2325
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:30,960
with the ring of cheetos around their

2326
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:34,000
mouth and i try not to look

2327
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,198
because that's not even real food but um

2328
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,399
[Music]

2329
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:40,559
i always tell parents to try dietary i

2330
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:42,559
always encourage it

2331
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,080
just give it three months of gluten free

2332
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,440
it's a lot easier to do gluten-free now

2333
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:47,279
than it ever was because there's so many

2334
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:48,799
gluten-free options even here there's

2335
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:51,119
gluten free and you go out to dinner

2336
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,159
they mark on the you know on a

2337
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,000
menu

2338
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:55,359
but many people are reluctant to do it

2339
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,719
and i think part of that is they don't

2340
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:58,880
want to do gluten-free and they don't

2341
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,239
want to have to prepare a meal for their

2342
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,079
child

2343
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:03,678
that is special and then everybody else

2344
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:05,279
is eating something different oh no that

2345
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,440
won't work yeah that won't work either

2346
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:08,800
so it's a challenge it's a great

2347
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:10,960
question um

2348
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,440
and some people do it hardcore and other

2349
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,679
people when i mention it just say that's

2350
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:18,879
last resort so do you find that the ones

2351
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:20,480
that are doing it get better results

2352
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,639
it's a good question i would say that

2353
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:25,119
the ones that stick to it are sticking

2354
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:26,960
to it for a reason because they see

2355
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:28,800
and remember too that once your child's

2356
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,079
old enough you don't have control over

2357
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,800
what they eat right they go to a

2358
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:34,960
birthday party or they go to a

2359
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,360
you know they're in high school yeah um

2360
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:40,158
and so again that so it's a very hard

2361
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:42,158
thing um more so in the pediatric uh

2362
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:45,279
autism i'm sorry epilepsy group is the

2363
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:47,439
ketogenic diet yeah yeah but that is a

2364
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:49,759
parents will do that at all costs

2365
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:51,839
because when you live with intractable

2366
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,960
seizures if just changing tweaking the

2367
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,199
diet

2368
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,119
and you have usually for ketogenic diet

2369
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,119
they have a dietitian as part of their

2370
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:01,439
neurology appointment and they just get

2371
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:04,559
so much assistance for that

2372
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:07,678
i i don't see as many parents seeking

2373
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:09,440
that kind of nutritional assistance um

2374
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,679
with children with autism although you

2375
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:13,519
could i'm sure that you could see a a

2376
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,279
nutritionist or a dietitian to help you

2377
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,719
with that but this is a great question i

2378
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:19,359
think it's a whole picture right you

2379
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:21,359
know how for autism one of their um

2380
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:23,599
their little logo is the puzzle piece

2381
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:25,759
yeah that's what it is yeah cannabis is

2382
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:28,239
just another puzzle piece and so is the

2383
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,840
diet cool thank you thank you

2384
01:25:28,238 --> 01:25:33,638
any other questions

2385
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,639
thank you very much everybody
