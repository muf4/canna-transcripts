00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,518
welcome everyone back to the canmed

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,359
coffee talk lounge here at canmed2022

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,080
i'm your host ben emerald host of the

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,000
canmed coffee talk podcast and i have

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
seth crawford here joining me in the

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,920
coffee talk lounge our cultivation

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,679
keynote presenter seth good to see you

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,080
thanks for having me appreciate it

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,320
absolutely and how nice is it to be back

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,198
at an in-person event here at cam ed and

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
what are you looking to get out of the

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,720
event uh pretty excited about it this is

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,920
the first time that we've gone to a

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,960
conference in three years um very very

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,079
excited about a number of the

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,160
presentations uh just really excited to

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,759
see what's happened in three years

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,519
there's been an absolute just obvious

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,280
decline in

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,280
in public events and this is going to be

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,160
a great chance to reconnect with a lot

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,239
of people that were not necessarily even

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,078
in the story three years ago right so

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,439
it's very exciting yeah and you

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,640
mentioned presentations that you're

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,359
looking forward to what are some of

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,359
those

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,759
uh really looking forward to keith

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,000
allen's talk on terpenes uh jordan

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,599
zager's talk on

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,920
sort of that the whole pantheon of how

32
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,319
to how to create good cannabis for

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,879
consumers um stoked about kevin

34
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,399
mckiernan's talk on psilocybin

35
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,920
we we played a small role in that in

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,920
doing some of the early sequencing work

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,519
so we're very excited to see what

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
direction that's gone

39
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,920
um and to be perfectly honest i'm very

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,880
excited probably the most excited to see

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,118
alicia holloway talking about thcv

42
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,798
breeding efforts with philos and the

43
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,920
reason i'm excited about it is i can't

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,159
wait to see how people react to philos

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,680
just leave it at that yeah and thcv you

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,600
have some experience reading that as

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,960
well a lot so thcv is identical to cbdv

48
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,679
cbgv cbcv etc in terms of the precursor

49
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,599
chemicals so what that presentation is

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,840
really going to be about are the

51
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,199
underlying genomic regions of interest

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,399
that make

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
baron production possible

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,239
the

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,519
uh

56
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,959
the findings are going to be interesting

57
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,959
because it's probably going to be the

58
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,879
same thing that we found and we did that

59
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,640
with the snip chip along with eurofins

60
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,000
and in medicinal genomics about two

61
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
years ago to identify different

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
chromosomes that had associations with

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,360
that uh that particular trait

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,878
it's polygenic it's spread across at

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,280
least six different chromosomes very

66
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,840
difficult from a breeding perspective

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,800
the title of her talk is about thcv but

68
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,560
the real

69
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,599
underlying information is about those

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,120
those precursor genes that allow all of

71
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,878
the other cannabinoids to happen so

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
we've been doing identical parallel

73
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,919
research so very curious to see what

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,760
they found

75
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,039
excellent and yeah and it's interesting

76
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,399
you say that and if i understand this

77
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,400
correctly so

78
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,039
it's the same enzymes or the same

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,959
pathways creating thc a or thc v it's

80
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,639
just that precursor molecule that's

81
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,640
different uh yeah so the gene

82
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,719
responsible for thc production is the

83
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,719
same gene that makes thcb right so it's

84
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:57,759
a thcas and the same thing's true with

85
00:02:52,719 --> 00:03:00,000
cbdas cbcas and on the underlying cbgas

86
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,679
on chromosome x that's responsible for

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,878
creating all the precursors in general

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,800
but you're just looking at two different

89
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,280
metabolic pathways one that's pencil one

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,280
that's propyl with different upstream

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,800
regulation

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,598
both of our research has basically been

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,840
looking at the propyl version of that

94
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,479
looking at the upstream components okay

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,120
and so what is the importance of thcv or

96
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,280
what is the potential use for it uh we

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,280
were using it to help farmers get around

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,400
some of the regulatory requirements with

99
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,919
industrial hemp production because thcv

100
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
when it's in the plant is not part of

101
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,759
the 0.3 total thc that's allowed and so

102
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,679
we can basically create higher

103
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,158
cannabinoid content plants that have

104
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,400
both cbd and cbdv

105
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,560
in the fraction while reducing the total

106
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,560
the total amount of thc

107
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,719
from medical perspective i'm really not

108
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
an expert on that but the people who are

109
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,158
studying it have looked at a number of

110
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,319
different potential applications

111
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,479
specifically related to the things that

112
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,598
are interesting to me anyway uh looking

113
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:00,000
at diabetes and potential help with

114
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,399
insulin resistance so that's absolutely

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,959
fascinating to me um really it's about

116
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,438
making these compounds available thcv

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,319
has not been available widely uh neither

118
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,840
cbdv or cbgv getting these into people's

119
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,598
hands is really what's going to tell us

120
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,000
what they're effective in treating

121
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,839
excellent okay so as we mentioned you're

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,160
a keynote presenter and the title of

123
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,719
your talk is cannabis 2022 the golden

124
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
year of discovery now back when you

125
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
first signed on to be the keynote

126
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
presenter that was going to be canmed

127
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,040
2020 and that was the title of your talk

128
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,680
was cannabis 2020 the golden year of

129
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,280
discovery so i guess what has happened

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
in those two years and how are you going

131
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,559
to cram that all into a one-hour

132
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
presentation so much information and

133
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,680
quite honestly busted right i just

134
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
recycled the same uh the same title and

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
the reality the underlying reality here

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,879
is that cannabis as a plant doesn't

137
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,080
really give a damn about social

138
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,759
constructs

139
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,680
years are the same to the plant it

140
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,680
doesn't matter if it's still alive and

141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,759
able to grow it's the golden year for

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,079
the plant itself and i think being able

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,080
to look at this from the perspective of

144
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,758
plants rather than from the human

145
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,199
perspective is sometimes enlightening in

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,720
terms of the way that we look at the

147
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,478
world

148
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,240
it's not so much about social constructs

149
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,599
as it is

150
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,120
understanding that just being able to

151
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,520
have these plants available to us and

152
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,800
being able to use them is

153
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,799
probably one of the best times to be

154
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,240
alive in this country but in terms of

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,319
real research that has happened in the

156
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400
last three years we were shooting in the

157
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,279
dark in 2018 we were doing things

158
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,120
basically through brute force approaches

159
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,038
that a lot of the genomic and more

160
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
technical tools have allowed us to do

161
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,879
away with and so it's rapidly expanded

162
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,239
our ability to breed

163
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,639
make selections when plants are

164
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,759
seedlings rather than full-grown plants

165
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,519
i mean it's just

166
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,879
incredible in terms of the amount of

167
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,799
discovery that's happened in the last

168
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,199
three years yeah

169
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
and i know that when we've spoken in the

170
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,038
past one of the at least what you said

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
one of the main reasons that your your

172
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,318
company focuses on hemp is because you

173
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,399
know obviously the regulations around

174
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
how much cannabis you can grow when

175
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,079
there's fewer restrictions on hemp so

176
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,280
you can do sort of these large-scale

177
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,359
breeding projects um so as you mentioned

178
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,879
some of these genomic tools that can you

179
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,240
know maybe reduce your footprint you

180
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,719
don't have to have so many plants is

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,960
there any chance you could um be staring

182
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,240
into cannabis instead of him uh it's all

183
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,198
the same so to answer it coyly yes um

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
we're gonna have an announcement

185
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,600
tomorrow uh we are entering the thc

186
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,959
reading space so that's going to be a

187
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,400
little bit of the the final part of the

188
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,399
presentation

189
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,239
and it's a very yeah this is the place

190
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,478
to release it this is a great conference

191
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,800
and you know there's a number of people

192
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,918
that are making significant waves in the

193
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,960
industry and we'd love to be able to

194
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,959
share that information um there has been

195
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,560
in the last three months some dramatic

196
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,000
changes at the federal level in terms of

197
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,160
policy that with a few llcs and some

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,160
other

199
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,478
legal approaches that allow us to

200
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,000
basically get into the thc market so

201
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,318
we're really excited to be able to offer

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,038
triploids and tetraploid seed varieties

203
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,120
for thc growers around the country wow

204
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,719
yeah that is exciting super exciting

205
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
yeah and i mean i guess to kind of go

206
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,039
back to that and i know it's an issue in

207
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
the universities as well where a lot of

208
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,120
universities are starting help programs

209
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,720
but it is restricted to hemp

210
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
and as you mentioned it is pretty much

211
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,800
the same plant it's just sort of that

212
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,560
0.3 thc designation but

213
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
you know is there some differences there

214
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,319
are are some of these universities kind

215
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,079
of missing out on some you know

216
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,280
potential discoveries because they're

217
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,639
only focused on help no because the only

218
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,239
thing that makes a chemical difference

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,800
in the plant is a single gene on

220
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,319
chromosome 7 for the most part so any of

221
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,598
the other elements that are on

222
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,080
chromosome 7 we're going to talk a

223
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,680
little bit about that tomorrow

224
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,120
they could potentially be something

225
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,560
that's we're missing out on because

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,399
there's not a lot of recombination that

227
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,598
happens between the chromosomes

228
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,959
um

229
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,800
the universities themselves at this

230
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,719
point have basically this is the great

231
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,120
part of the 2018 farm bill they have

232
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,639
been allowed relatively free reign and

233
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
it really comes down to their risk

234
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,800
assessment certain universities have

235
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,840
been very risk avoidant and have not

236
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,160
gone into uh more and say exhaustive

237
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,159
surveys of what's available um

238
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
other universities have uh cornell is a

239
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,759
really good example of that in my mind

240
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,560
in that they were they were willing to

241
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,319
engage in field trials from 2018 on of

242
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,399
any germ plasm that people were willing

243
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,840
to submit for industrial have and the

244
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,359
reality was they've got a couple really

245
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,560
good publications out of this was that

246
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,759
there were a lot of people who were just

247
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,280
doing poor breeding they didn't

248
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,598
understand the underlying mechanisms

249
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,959
that allowed people to grow cbd dominant

250
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,158
varieties and still have it be

251
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,598
considered hemp under the federal

252
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,599
guidelines

253
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,440
so they were submitting type 2 plants

254
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,120
and type 1 plants in a lot of cases that

255
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,599
were you know 8 to 12 to 15 thc

256
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,839
and the moral of the story here is that

257
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,440
the world didn't end cornell grew these

258
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600
plants they assessed them and they said

259
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,760
hey farmers need to be aware that people

260
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,879
are selling stuff that will get them put

261
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,360
in jail

262
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,519
that was a huge public service and i you

263
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,120
know should definitely be applauded

264
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,799
whereas other universities have not gone

265
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,278
that route so

266
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,439
in summary universities are working with

267
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,360
cannabis and it's actually fairly

268
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,120
revolutionary it hasn't happened in a

269
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,959
very long time and there's great

270
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
research results coming out of it yeah

271
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,159
that's exciting

272
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,200
i did want to mention something that i

273
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,439
read in your abstract and you say

274
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,720
you talk about the long-standing promise

275
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,279
of the plant

276
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,959
in food fiber medicine and unknown

277
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,720
unknowns um

278
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,879
and so why do you believe hemp has not

279
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,560
really lived up to its billing as this

280
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,000
super crop that can replace all these

281
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,439
other crops because it seems like most

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,278
of the cultivation has been focused on

283
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,120
cannabinoids it really has and to be

284
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,679
honest i think a lot of this has to do

285
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,560
with the history of people making uh

286
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,799
really

287
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,639
expansive promises based on very little

288
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,719
data so a lot of the research that

289
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,080
people were looking at in terms of grain

290
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,879
looking at you know like super

291
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,920
capacitors out of hemp fiber great

292
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,759
research um really really interesting

293
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,240
it got people thinking that hemp could

294
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,319
do a million different things and it can

295
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,759
but the reality is is that the actual

296
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,360
fundamental research that's required to

297
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,439
bring those things to fruition hasn't

298
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,120
occurred and at the same time many of

299
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,320
the things that were over promised

300
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,399
essentially

301
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,720
are not going to materialize in the u.s

302
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,480
you know grain and fiber crops are not

303
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
competitive economically in the us

304
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,759
compared to canada china france other

305
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,759
major producers that have been doing

306
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,799
this for a number of years

307
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,399
but

308
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,078
at the end of the day it may not matter

309
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,000
because some of the research that that's

310
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,559
now being done is a great one done at

311
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,879
oregon state this past year on using

312
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:34,559
industrial hemp grain and fiber as a

313
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:37,600
food source for animals for livestock

314
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,439
this is going to allow small farmers to

315
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,040
feed their animals in a more efficient

316
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,720
way based off of a crop that's actually

317
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,719
produced right there

318
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
in their backyard so i think the way

319
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,160
that we need to think about it

320
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
should change rather than looking at it

321
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,439
as some sort of economic driver that's

322
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,799
going to make everybody a billionaire

323
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,360
and the world's going to be driving

324
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,719
around hem infused cars we really need

325
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,159
to look at the actual practical

326
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,759
applications of what we can do with this

327
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,399
plant and how we can leverage its

328
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,240
plastic plasticity

329
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,240
to help farmers and other people who can

330
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,839
actually use it so

331
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,399
excellent there's a bright future out

332
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,839
there yeah i know it sounds like um all

333
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,839
right so in

334
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,519
in wrapping up here

335
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,200
just curious to get your thoughts that

336
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,399
you know given that a lot of this

337
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
research although we talked about the

338
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,759
universities are getting back into it

339
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,838
but still a lot of the research being

340
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,759
done into this plant is by

341
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,480
privately funded companies

342
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,159
and with that said

343
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,159
maybe speak to the importance of coming

344
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,519
to an event like canmed and sharing that

345
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,360
information with the community instead

346
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,959
of kind of keeping it close to the vast

347
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,079
i mean obviously you got to keep some

348
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,078
things for yourself but it's really hard

349
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,838
to be to be honest i understand where a

350
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,719
lot of these companies are coming from

351
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,360
the the cannabis marketplace for as much

352
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,879
economic benefit and as as much of an

353
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,879
impact as it has

354
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,838
um most producers are really having a

355
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,120
hard time staying in

356
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,639
business suppliers of technical

357
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,039
equipment are having a hard time you

358
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,079
know helping the hemp market out they're

359
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,838
having a hard time dealing with the

360
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,239
cannabis market it's just constantly in

361
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,240
flux

362
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,680
where we go from there uh

363
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,480
is going to be largely determined by the

364
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,879
way that we deal with that data and

365
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,720
i personally view data is essentially

366
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,278
like you know it's money it's something

367
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,959
that took money to create but it's also

368
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,320
not something that as companies we're

369
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,479
going to be able to do anything with

370
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,560
when we're gone and so what is the point

371
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,920
in hoarding that data and not being able

372
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,838
to make it public

373
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,278
something that we find that we may have

374
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,360
questions about when it goes out to

375
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,720
collaborators or to the general public

376
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
other scientists

377
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,920
maybe they have an idea about how to fix

378
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,519
that or how to do something more unique

379
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,039
with it you know we can come up with all

380
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,039
kinds of ideas but at the end of the day

381
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,799
it's not what we do it's what other

382
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,480
people are able to do with it that ends

383
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,359
up having the lasting legacy and we're

384
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,800
more concerned about being able to push

385
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,720
science forward and to be able to make

386
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,799
this plant more accessible to as many

387
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,680
people as possible

388
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:04,078
without getting caught up with money and

389
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,078
it's the unfortunate reality of life in

390
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,199
general but we're doing whatever we can

391
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,799
to get around that all right well

392
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,879
seth we're glad to have you here at

393
