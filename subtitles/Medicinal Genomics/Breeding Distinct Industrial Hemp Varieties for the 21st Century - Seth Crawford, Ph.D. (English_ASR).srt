1
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,539
hello thanks for having me here

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,629
thanks to medicinal genomics for putting

3
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:15,399
this on and really thanks for just

4
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:17,980
taking the time to stick around great

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,260
conference great speakers what I'm here

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,170
to talk to you about today is growing

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,480
from seed we have a small production

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,770
company based out of Oregon we've been

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,960
in business for about four years my

10
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:31,000
brother and I co-founded it in 2015 and

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,500
this past season was sort of a

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,878
culmination of a lot of the research and

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,939
development that we've been working on

14
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:39,849
over the over that four years that

15
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:41,439
resulted in about four thousand acres of

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:46,079
production across the United States for

17
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:48,908
Fito cannabinoid rich CBD CBD hemp

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,039
roughly 15 million pounds of biomass

19
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:53,738
testing at about 10% on whole plant

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,300
extraction so what I'm here to talk to

21
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:58,358
you about is a little bit of the behind

22
00:00:55,299 --> 00:01:00,728
the scenes of what we do and how we do

23
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,948
it first off I do want to just say

24
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,539
thanks to medicinal genomics orange

25
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:06,009
photonics and Pyxis laboratories in

26
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,930
Portland all three of these companies

27
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,370
have radically changed the way that we

28
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,439
actually go about the plant breeding

29
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,630
process they have markedly accelerated

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:17,709
what we can do and how quickly we can

31
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:20,679
bring true f1 hybrids to to the market

32
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:22,599
for farmers to produce with and I'd be

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,850
remiss if I did not thank everybody on

34
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,599
my staff at oregon CBD and every day is

35
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:29,769
Monday Monday one Monday to Monday three

36
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,968
we've been working tirelessly for the

37
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:33,039
last four years to be able to make sure

38
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:35,949
that phyto cannabinoids non-psychoactive

39
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,718
cannabinoid could be accessed by

40
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,700
everybody in the country everybody in

41
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:40,959
the world at a reasonable price and

42
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,840
we'll talk a little bit more about how

43
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,849
that's come about one way to think about

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,810
cannabis legalization in the United

45
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:49,030
States we essentially have three

46
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,000
separate markets my background is

47
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,399
actually I have a PhD in sociology my

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,629
research was on the political economy of

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,409
cannabis in the way that it was

50
00:01:55,629 --> 00:02:00,640
unfolding in 2013 and 2014 the way to

51
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,618
think about this is that we essentially

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,170
have three channels the first is the

53
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:07,478
adult use medical use recreational

54
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,000
however you want to describe it and its

55
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:13,900
THC dominant there's a high regulatory

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,509
burden seed to sale tracking testing

57
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,860
which is also a good thing but the

58
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,329
downside of that is that you're looking

59
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,650
at a fairly small user base

60
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,630
anywhere between fifteen to twenty

61
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,319
percent of the population at any given

62
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:27,609
time is consuming THC there are other

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,959
cannabinoids that are obviously being

64
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,330
used but that's that's the predominant

65
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,099
cannabinoid what's interesting about

66
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,750
that too and this is a now something

67
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:37,210
that came out of my research is that the

68
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,340
total u.s. demand for THC can be met on

69
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,170
about six thousand acres it produced

70
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,629
right in Southern Oregon so this is a

71
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:45,579
small market relative to the non

72
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,310
psychoactive x' and it's easily

73
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,140
capturable by by folks with a lot of

74
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,580
capital on the other aspect of this is

75
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,839
the pharmaceutical industry and we've

76
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,210
obviously heard a lot about different

77
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,909
compounds that have been developed and

78
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,349
trialed and that are coming online it's

79
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:01,180
fantastic we love it

80
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:03,129
but again the user base in this

81
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,439
situation is determined in part by the

82
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,759
FDA and insurance companies as well as

83
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,520
the applicability of each one of these

84
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:12,250
very specialized compounds for specific

85
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,350
treatments we like industrial hemp at

86
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,539
least from our perspective one because

87
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:18,459
it's non psychoactive - there was a very

88
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:22,030
low regulatory burden getting into this

89
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:23,680
industry and the user base is pretty big

90
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,689
you're talking about all vertebrates and

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,159
according to some of the research there

92
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:28,509
are some invertebrates as well we're not

93
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:32,919
sure how we're gonna capitalize on that

94
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:34,479
financially but it's out there real

95
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,729
quick hemp and marijuana in the United

96
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,969
States there's a differentiation between

97
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:42,459
them with hemp being anything below 0.3

98
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:44,469
percent THC this is obviously an

99
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,439
arbitrary socially constructed limit

100
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:49,659
that dates back to small and cronquist a

101
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,819
publication from some canadian

102
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:54,129
scientists in 1976 that we're examining

103
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:57,069
new leaf tissues on mature plants

104
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:58,449
obviously that's not necessarily the

105
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,799
best way to go about it today we have

106
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:02,139
better tools to assess what the

107
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,390
differences are and truly when you look

108
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,009
at the literature it says most of the

109
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:07,599
genomic data and literature on cannabis

110
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,549
at this point says it's all the same

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,129
there's just two very closely linked

112
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,930
genes eight centimorgans apart on the

113
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:16,029
same chromosome to differentiate between

114
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,590
these different types if you step back

115
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,268
and you look at this from a perspective

116
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,829
from a producer you're interested in

117
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,899
trying to have large plant numbers to be

118
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,469
able to do targeted breeding programs

119
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:28,060
and develop new unique cultivars

120
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,860
anything that's not type 1 or type 2 is

121
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,389
essentially fair game if you jump into

122
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,889
the hemp industry and with the passage

123
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,490
of the 2014 farm bill

124
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,538
we all had the opportunity to do that so

125
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,759
the originating question that really

126
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:41,318
drove our research was how can we make

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,080
non-psychoactive cannabinoid it's both

128
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:47,020
available and affordable picture of my

129
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,240
my trail running buddy in 2014 he was

130
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:51,250
about 11 years old hips were hurting he

131
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,288
was suffering from occasional seizures

132
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,939
and I found that CBD really was an

133
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:56,949
effective treatment for him helped out a

134
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:58,150
lot the problem was is it was about

135
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,610
twenty five hundred dollars a pound

136
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:02,049
wholesale when THC was about twenty-two

137
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,000
hundred dollars a pound wholesale at the

138
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,879
same time just seemed ridiculous

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,668
so we started to try to figure out how

140
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,080
to alleviate that the goal was to

141
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:13,810
essentially replicate what's already

142
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,250
been done this is no secret most of us

143
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,658
are all doing the same thing that

144
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,250
somebody's done before I hate to burst

145
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:21,129
everyone's bubble but we did the same

146
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,228
thing we tried to replicate corta farm

147
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:25,629
and GW farmers single cannabinoid chemo

148
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:27,128
type breeding program but importantly we

149
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,528
were not focused on just developing

150
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,569
individual clones for production in

151
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:33,490
sealed warehouses or greenhouses or

152
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:37,150
etcetera we really wanted to be able to

153
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:39,069
produce true f1 100% female plant

154
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:42,008
varieties that can be deployed across

155
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:45,098
the country with small farmers being

156
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,449
able to produce these compounds we also

157
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:47,800
needed to address some of the big issues

158
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:50,228
that come along with large-scale

159
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,770
production namely harvesting and drying

160
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:55,628
either using mechanization or using

161
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:58,359
music nature when when at all possible

162
00:05:55,629 --> 00:06:00,610
and that required that we'd have to

163
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,199
develop independent lines based on photo

164
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,848
period sensitivity and that included

165
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,460
day-neutral plants which are considered

166
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:07,240
autoflowering early flowering plants

167
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,668
which is something that we actually

168
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,139
invented quote/unquote invented again

169
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:12,848
following in other people's footsteps

170
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:17,379
but these are plants that start

171
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:20,588
flowering shortly after the peak in June

172
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:22,210
of sunshine and essentially finish up in

173
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,639
the month of September in most locations

174
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:26,198
across the United States as well as what

175
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,908
most people are accustomed to which is

176
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,210
we call it a traditional long season

177
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:33,610
plan this is the behind the scenes this

178
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:34,659
is sort of the the in-depth breeding

179
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,689
program

180
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,490
that we operate at our facilities and

181
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:42,310
what this requires in terms of being

182
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,710
able to develop individual true-breeding

183
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,769
f1 lines is you start off with two

184
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:49,509
completely unrelated very distinct

185
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:51,639
parental lines you cross those two

186
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:54,430
planets depending on what your goals are

187
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,560
whether it's a chemo type chemo type

188
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,090
switch or increase in cannabinoid

189
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,180
content or creating structural

190
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:03,519
differences in the plant itself you in

191
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,639
Bri those excuse me you cross those and

192
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,620
create your f1 hybrids from there we

193
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,229
isolate each one of those F ones that

194
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,939
come out and generally this is you don't

195
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,040
need a very large sample size when

196
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:17,620
you're working with F ones sometimes we

197
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,030
go down to 20 plants in breed each one

198
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,860
of those collect the seeds off of those

199
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:23,500
using a self fertilization technique

200
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:27,550
described by Ram and set in 1980 1982

201
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,019
using silver thiosulfate the resulting

202
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,060
seeds that come off of those plants are

203
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:32,649
again isolated we grow those out we

204
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,839
spend their summers growing out F twos

205
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:36,879
which is sort of where unicorns emerge

206
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,199
this is a common thing that folks are

207
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,980
looking for in the plant breeding world

208
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,899
where they are just absolute

209
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,790
masterpieces of recombination taking the

210
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:47,859
best of both parts of the parents both

211
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,650
of the p1 and the p2 and creating

212
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,199
something unique diverse and new from

213
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:55,329
there to be able to to isolate and lock

214
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,189
in those traits we continue to in breed

215
00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:01,089
generation after generation after

216
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:02,529
generation in isolation as long as we

217
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,629
can one of the biggest challenges that

218
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:06,789
we run into especially on the hemp side

219
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:09,850
is infertility tends to set in fairly

220
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:12,430
quickly in general we average about f4

221
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,450
the f4 generation it's a third round of

222
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,750
selfing basically attempting to reduce

223
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:18,250
heterozygosity

224
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,350
make the plants as true breeding as

225
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,120
possible so that when we do end up

226
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,030
eventually out crossing it to create our

227
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,519
f1 hybrids that you end up with high

228
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:31,000
levels of uniformity so again just to

229
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:33,728
highlight on the left you're seeing the

230
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,159
development of one line and that arrow

231
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,450
pointing to the circle is another

232
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,949
independent line that has to be

233
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,039
developed just to make each one of these

234
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,920
f1 hybrids once we've isolated these

235
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:47,259
plants before we release it to farmers

236
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,429
we run progeny trials so we'll have a

237
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,389
number of different variety

238
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,429
it came out of these different

239
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,919
inbreeding projects we cross it out to

240
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:55,569
our pollen donor and then we run our

241
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,909
trials to figure out which of these

242
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,070
plants are most stable when out crossed

243
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:02,019
and in general we usually come down to

244
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,580
one or two plants and those plants are

245
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,809
lucky enough to get put into our

246
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,850
breeding programs mass propagated and

247
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:12,189
end up resulting in producing seed for

248
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,259
farmers so the take-home message on this

249
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,490
is one if you're a plant breeder and

250
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:17,860
you're really looking for something

251
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,740
unique f2 is where it happens there's

252
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,209
just incredible things that pop up here

253
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,039
and it's a very different approach from

254
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,509
what we end up seeing in traditional

255
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:27,879
cannabis where you're crossing to

256
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:30,278
usually poly hybrid varieties that end

257
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:31,838
up not being true breeding when you try

258
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,610
to put them in the field but large-scale

259
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,589
field production requires a very

260
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,580
different approach and it's only solved

261
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:41,589
with true F once what we've been able to

262
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,300
do with the help of these analytical

263
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,550
testing companies and this breeding

264
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:47,799
process is essentially be able to create

265
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:51,278
new varieties in anywhere between 18 to

266
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:53,079
24 months depending on chemo type or the

267
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,600
specific terpene combinations that we're

268
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,660
looking for we end up with very vigorous

269
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,810
very uniform structurally stable dense

270
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:04,360
high yielding just beautiful flowers

271
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,859
that are perfect for farmers who just

272
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,089
need to put plants in the ground and

273
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,950
figure out how to harvest them to get

274
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:10,330
them to market and the really cool part

275
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:15,310
about this is that we've actually been

276
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:17,470
able to achieve 99.97% female plants in

277
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:19,629
these in these fields it's essentially 1

278
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,759
in 4,000 plants ends up having a male

279
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:23,889
phenotype we've actually tested it they

280
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,379
all have two x-chromosomes are really

281
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:29,528
female but they have a male phenotype

282
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:30,970
and if you let them pollinate plants 50%

283
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,860
of the following progeny will end up

284
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,660
having that male phenotype so they're

285
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,980
problematic need to be removed we're

286
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:37,929
working on trying to get it to a hundred

287
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,730
percent but at this point ninety-nine

288
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:43,778
point nine seven is we think it's pretty

289
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:46,120
good as I just mentioned our CBD lines

290
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:48,458
this is basically a three to four year

291
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,578
project we had our first lines in 2014

292
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:53,588
we out crossed those using the the

293
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:56,708
schema that I showed before and we've

294
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:58,570
conducted field trials in 2016 to 2017

295
00:10:56,708 --> 00:11:00,219
before releasing those to farmers and

296
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,020
again we had over 4,000 acres in

297
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,690
production in industrial

298
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:06,370
legal states across the country yields

299
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,839
ranged anywhere between two thousand

300
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,480
eight thousand pounds per acre and

301
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,860
you're looking at a content of 8 to 12

302
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,320
percent on biomass

303
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,879
although the outliers and for all of the

304
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,370
varieties that we developed are well

305
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:20,980
over 20 percent on total CBD a content

306
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,950
on trim flower tops which is basically

307
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,259
we've taken industrial hemp and turned

308
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,000
it into the final cannabinoid rich THC

309
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,740
cultivars with great terpenes and great

310
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,379
structure that everybody loves but you

311
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,350
can produce them in a field some shots

312
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:38,379
of that the shot on the left is a 1500

313
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,389
acre farm in Kentucky same shot on the

314
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,528
right just a close-up if you're

315
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:43,838
interested in seeing more pictures of

316
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:47,370
this we have a photo contest on

317
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,830
Instagram hashtag best oregon CBD photos

318
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:53,409
absolutely beautiful results great great

319
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:56,370
plants and really the farmers made us

320
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:58,149
look good so that's one compound

321
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,509
obviously the goal is to be able to

322
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:03,610
isolate and put into production other

323
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:07,059
compounds as well our next target was

324
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,700
CBG we found our first pure CBG line in

325
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,289
the first quarter of 2017 this plant was

326
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,690
about nine and a half percent

327
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:17,078
CBG less than 0.1 percent THC

328
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:20,050
non-detectable CBD and it had a hundred

329
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:21,219
to one ratio for CBG to THC which when

330
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:23,679
you're looking at the industrial hemp

331
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,810
laws in the farm bill in the United

332
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,599
States a 0.3% means that you could

333
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:31,629
actually run up to 30 percent CBG on a

334
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,129
trim flower and still be legal for

335
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:39,159
interstate commerce in the United States

336
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,990
we have improved these lines over the

337
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,240
last year and a half and we conducted

338
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:46,930
large-scale field trials this past

339
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,399
season this is a picture of this again

340
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:50,439
this is no sleight of hand some people

341
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,839
for some reason think that when you have

342
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,520
a high level of CBG it's because the

343
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,430
plant was harvested early or you did

344
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,769
some sort of magic with with the root

345
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:01,778
zone these are just full-term plants

346
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:03,970
that happen to have THC turned

347
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:05,528
completely off just through a random

348
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,370
mutation that we happen to find the

349
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:11,439
needle in the haystack

350
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:13,720
and a regular non-functional CBD allele

351
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
so this particular plant tested at

352
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,970
eighteen point nine percent

353
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,070
CBG that's on a trim flower and again

354
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,210
you can see the the THCA content on that

355
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:27,270
is way below the 0.3% requirement to be

356
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:28,950
federally legal the beauty of this too

357
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,439
is once you start in breeding plants of

358
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,278
another tip if you can f2 is where the

359
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,900
magic happens

360
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,720
but inbreeding is where you can really

361
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:38,939
lock in and find incredible results with

362
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,339
the inbreeding on our CBG lines we're

363
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,540
able to attain right now that the

364
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,360
highest level that we've seen is four

365
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,669
hundred and eighty to one ratio so CB g

366
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,060
to THC which means that you can make oil

367
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:53,219
in this case forty percent CB g rosin

368
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:54,869
and still be below the federal the

369
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,800
federal limit of point three percent on

370
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:01,440
THC it's I think it's kind of cool we've

371
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,370
also discovered CBC Bridge plants CBC

372
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,740
rich plants are a little bit more

373
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,470
difficult in that there is a linkage

374
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,269
between cannabinoid content total

375
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,399
cannabinoid content production and the

376
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:13,009
CBC gene for some reason and we haven't

377
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,449
been able to get over about five percent

378
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:17,970
five percent total cannabinoid content

379
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,620
on those lines but they are CBC rich

380
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,420
anywhere between twenty to thirty

381
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,970
percent of the total cannabinoid

382
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,939
fraction there may be better ways of

383
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,879
going about producing CBC which would be

384
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,580
maybe isolating it in CBD lines or in CB

385
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:34,439
g lines but we're working to improve

386
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,160
that and we'll have field trials out in

387
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,080
2019 again just some analytical data to

388
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,409
back that up I'm not kidding

389
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,170
they're real my favorite thing that we

390
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:48,059
discovered this past summer in part

391
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:50,039
because I do like beer and I like the

392
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,419
hops industry but I feel bad for hops

393
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,588
growers it just doesn't look like much

394
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:57,000
fun

395
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:58,980
we thanks for glass we discovered

396
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,929
cannabinoid free plants there is

397
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,278
literature that describes the functional

398
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:04,528
mechanisms that make this happen its

399
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,970
upstream of CBG production you're

400
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,980
basically just turning off some of the

401
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,009
precursor chemicals and the plant only

402
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,269
bioaccumulates terpenes it is really

403
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,919
cool you're looking at the planet it

404
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:16,259
looks resinous it looks crazy

405
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,039
it smells wonderful there's no

406
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,360
cannabinoids so we found this and when

407
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,899
you look at the literature it suggests

408
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,120
that it takes two generations of so you

409
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,730
can out cross to any any flavor that

410
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,448
you're interested

411
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:34,028
in Sour Diesel etc etc and within two

412
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:36,278
generations you can identify plants that

413
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:38,818
have that same terpene profile but no

414
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:41,259
cannabinoids whatsoever three minutes

415
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:42,909
I'm really excited about it because it's

416
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,220
more agronomically efficient than hops

417
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:47,019
it doesn't suffer from many of the same

418
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,649
diseases in part because we are growing

419
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:52,568
from seed and they do contain more oil

420
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,938
on average in the same terpene

421
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:56,649
combinations as some of the the

422
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:58,480
traditional hops so we're very excited

423
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,678
to be able to work with the brewing

424
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,188
industry and being able to bring these

425
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:06,639
to fruition and put them in beers here

426
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:08,678
shortly and again just to back that up

427
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,778
no cannabinoids and the rock

428
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:13,238
chromatogram for that anything on the

429
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:15,039
left-hand side of that one-minute mark I

430
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:17,589
was told by Pyxis labs that there was

431
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:22,088
just something caught in there in there

432
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:23,439
HPLC machine close-up picture of these

433
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:26,919
cannabinoid free plants again the

434
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:28,629
trichomes they're covered obviously

435
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:31,448
covered they look very resinous but the

436
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:33,938
trichome heads are much much smaller in

437
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:36,399
size than then we see with with other

438
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:39,548
plant lines last little bit here we have

439
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,828
discovered multiple THC VCB DV and cv

440
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:44,139
g'v lines now these are lines that do

441
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:46,238
not have any of the propos as the

442
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:48,428
dominant fraction but through inbreeding

443
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:49,899
we are working to improve those and have

444
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:51,608
heightened expression ready throughout

445
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:53,918
the rest of this year and into 2019

446
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:56,739
filled productions filled production is

447
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:58,389
slated for field trials for 2020 and we

448
00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:01,649
hope to have these out to farmers

449
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:04,959
everywhere across the country in 2021

450
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,919
the idea behind this is we know what's

451
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,528
going to happen with the cannabis

452
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,209
industry THC is an easy to monopolize

453
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,638
market you're going to end up with just

454
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,949
like the alcohol industry several

455
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:17,078
several very large companies dominating

456
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,730
production but if we can continue to

457
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,369
make each one of these novel

458
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,870
non-psychoactive cannabinoid available

459
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,938
for farmers to be able to produce we

460
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:26,678
have a chance to at least keep some of

461
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,659
the culture and some of the approaches

462
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,509
that we had in the cannabis industry

463
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:35,110
leading up to legalization alive and

464
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:37,329
well limit again looking ahead for 2019

465
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:39,038
we thought that CBD was probably going

466
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:40,889
to wash out it's not we've already got

467
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,359
contracts in place for over 15

468
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,310
Maker's it's almost a four-fold increase

469
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,589
over what was produced this year using

470
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:48,450
our seed so we're looking to increase

471
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:51,689
our capacity up to about fifty thousand

472
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,580
acres by the end of 2019 and like I

473
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,650
mentioned at the very beginning $2,500

474
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:57,839
pounds to get non psychoactive cannabis

475
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,120
to make my dog's hips feel better it

476
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,009
just seems wrong luckily we're down to

477
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,379
anywhere between twenty five to fifty

478
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:05,789
dollars a pound for equivalent biomass

479
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,980
at this point and that's over the course

480
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:09,569
of four years so we're very happy well

481
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,400
it's not necessarily great for farmers

482
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:13,139
it's great for consumers and people that

483
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,509
benefit from non-psychoactive

484
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,270
cannabinoid and we anticipate that this

485
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:21,420
is going to continue forward as time

486
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:22,970
goes on and we get better plants thank

487
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:27,479
you

488
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,479
[Applause]
