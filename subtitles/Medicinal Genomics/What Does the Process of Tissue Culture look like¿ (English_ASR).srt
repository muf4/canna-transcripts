2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,879
great so could you walk us through the

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,640
process of of tissue

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:24,640
culture okay uh sure I'm going to give

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,160
you a very brass tax uh very basic

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,679
explanation of the tissue culture

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,960
technique and also I have some um images

8
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,238
for both our research and also some

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,200
cartoony ones that are a little bit

10
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,238
easier to see if like the screen small

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,559
like they're just watching it on their

12
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:44,759
phone so uh the basic T process of

13
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:47,878
tissue culture is first you do a

14
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:51,039
selection of M of

15
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:53,320
materials that you select a plant and

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,780
you select the tissues in question and

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,960
then you

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,960
[Music]

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,960
um then you take and

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,000
oh we'll pull up this cartoon so you'll

21
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,840
take um a cutting from those tissues and

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,438
sterilize them this is so that you only

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,359
are dealing with the plants that you

24
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,478
wish to deal with and not of of any of

25
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,560
the pathogens or any of the other

26
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,200
materials you're specifically getting

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,359
you're only selecting for like say for

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,240
instance you only want Marist stem which

29
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,879
is like Bud tissue or you only want Leaf

30
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:32,640
tissue so you just get that and then you

31
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:35,078
uh plate the tissues on a media that has

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,159
um these cell signaling compounds that's

33
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,279
those compounds that I said beforehand

34
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,680
were like the plant saying hey look this

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:47,239
happened you need to do this so it grows

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:50,280
into um a mass of these Undeclared

37
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:53,239
majors of cells like undifferentiated

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,239
tissue called callus and then you take

39
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,839
and you start giving it signals to say

40
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,599
like hey I want you to make roots or hey

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,640
I want you to make this compound or hey

42
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:06,559
I want to make shoes and for in this

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,679
micropropagation slide um what you're

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
doing what this is doing is we're taking

45
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,199
uh some of the body tissue converting it

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,439
into callus and then converting that

47
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,199
tissue in that callus while we're making

48
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,039
the callus grow over and over again

49
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,799
we're also telling it to make more plant

50
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,799
babies now you know that's the cartoon

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,400
version um these are some of the

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,800
research pictures they might they might

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,120
not necessarily be as clear so this is

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,280
this is an example where that upper left

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,360
the white tissue that is that was some

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,560
cuting that I took off of a a

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,519
economically threatened plant and we

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,719
grew a whole mass of that tissue

59
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,920
normally that amount of tissue would

60
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:54,158
take about 2 or 3 years to grow because

61
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:56,158
it's it's it's a perennial this was

62
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:59,120
grown in months and then we convert

63
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:02,598
those tissues into a special subtype and

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:07,519
start making plant babies uh that's one

65
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:11,318
example um this is um this is from our

66
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,560
lab currently uh we're working with um

67
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:16,318
some of our partners and working doing

68
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,560
some work for them so I took some cuting

69
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,560
off of one of their mother plants and

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,719
then did a then selected for tissues

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,598
plated very small tissues and these guys

72
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:29,799
what they start doing on that little

73
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,000
jelly media that they grow that they

74
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,680
they in they grow they reproduce they

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
grow they reproduce they get bigger they

76
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,560
reproduce and more and more and then as

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,840
they get to a certain size they start

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,158
throwing shoots off and then we cut the

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,560
shoots off and you know propagate cut

80
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:47,719
the shoots off propagate until you get

81
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,680
basic this is probably a little bit more

82
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:54,000
easy for the the audience to see so so

83
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,000
that's like the basic process of tissue

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
culture

85
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:11,280
