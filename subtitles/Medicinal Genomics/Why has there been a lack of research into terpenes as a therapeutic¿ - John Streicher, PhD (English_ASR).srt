2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,960
um so why do you think that you know

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,518
they haven't been studied as a

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,480
therapeutic uh really to this

5
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,719
point well they have somewhat and there

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,839
are a lot of papers out there I don't

7
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,919
want to short anyone right or kind of be

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:31,920
insulting there are a lot of papers out

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,480
there um but they were still limited

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,399
right so it's like we're going to take a

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,759
A turpine or tpine extract we're going

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,640
to give a certain amount to patients and

13
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,320
then we see the pain relief but for

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
whatever reason I don't fully understand

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,359
why those next steps weren't taken like

16
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,159
what are the side effects what's the

17
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,558
what's the pharmacokinetics you know

18
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,119
what's the minimal dose that we need to

19
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:52,439
be effective um you know and really like

20
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:53,878
formalize and systematize this

21
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,358
investigation so you could really turn

22
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,599
it into something um I'm just

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,000
spitballing here I don't have any

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
evidence for that but like one of the

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,039
reasons could be because it's generally

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,640
regarded as safe maybe you can't get a

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,680
drug company interested in making a

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,879
product because you know you can't they

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,118
can't patent it um and that's where I've

30
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,399
been work all the companies that I've

31
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:13,079
been working with in this space are all

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,680
smaller companies right that that care

33
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,679
about cannabis that care about turpins

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,680
they're not looking to be fizer maybe

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,320
that's why they're the ones that are

36
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,920
willing to tackle it and maybe that's

37
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,599
why they haven't been tackled in the

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,000
past with some of the larger the larger

39
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,640
you know groups and it could also be the

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,759
possibility that funding has been harder

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,399
to come by I don't really know no so we

42
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:33,879
were able to get funding from this work

43
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,478
from a portion of the National

44
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,519
Institutes of Health the N uh called the

45
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,959
national Center for compliment and

46
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,640
Integrative Health the

47
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,118
ncci so kind of a sub subpart of the ni

48
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,560
and they had this program where they

49
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,959
were specifically interested in looking

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,840
at Turpin and minor cannaboids and so I

51
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,239
will say that just in general the

52
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,560
Cannabis field cannaboid field has grown

53
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,280
a lot recently you know the last 10 10

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,640
or so years all of that has grown

55
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,399
funding's become more available people

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,159
are becoming more interested and then

57
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,680
some of these minor components or or

58
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,000
understudied components of the cannabis

59
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,200
plant like tur beans and the minor

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
canabo those have also been growing very

61
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:14,159
strongly as well with that interest so

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,159
maybe the time is just here

63
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:28,270
