1
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,839
all right good morning everybody uh it's

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,320
exciting to see a lot of familiar faces

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,080
last canmed was here at the conference

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,759
center uh world is very different place

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,638
back then so glad we can get everyone

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,399
together

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,079
really exciting stuff

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,159
so

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,679
we're gonna be talking today about a

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,118
large study that we conducted on cbd but

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,640
before we dive in just to give you guys

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,118
some background

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,439
on uh the approach that we took and who

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,200
we actually are so you know our mission

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,679
as a company here at radical science was

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,760
really to democratize access to clinical

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,479
trials my background i started and ran

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,839
ucla's cannabis research program uh for

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,000
a number of years from 2017 to 2020 and

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,160
you would not believe how

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,558
ridiculously so inexpensive it was for

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,959
us to run clinical trials there was just

23
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,718
the general bureaucracy of any

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,439
university but because we received

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,879
federal funding there were very strict

26
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,960
requirements that we had to follow that

27
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,000
were not law but they were requirements

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,640
if you took

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,239
federal funding and so i left in the

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,599
middle of the pandemic to start radical

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,959
science to be able to offer trials to uh

32
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,039
non-prescription health products

33
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,879
starting with cannabinoids

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,960
and so we believe with data and with

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,319
trials you're converting these natural

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,359
health products

37
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,679
into

38
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,519
precision medicines

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,118
and these precision medicines are

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,719
democratized right they're always

41
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,519
accessible people can always get them

42
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,200
you don't have to go through a

43
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,879
healthcare system or a doctor to get a

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,719
hold of these products that's what

45
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,759
really drives us in radical science

46
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,920
michelle from my team is here um and uh

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,680
so it's it's exciting

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
a little bit of context i talked about

49
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
myself some of you might be familiar

50
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,519
with my co-founder palin thoroughgood so

51
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,399
she's a

52
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,679
technology entrepreneur

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,519
executive and for the last five years

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,079
she's her foundation the holistic

55
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,078
foundation has been the largest single

56
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,519
funder of cannabinoid research in

57
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,279
american history

58
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,879
about six million dollars of research

59
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,519
they've deployed to

60
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,639
places like uc san diego university utah

61
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,840
columbia university uc irvine etc so

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,519
that's how we met

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,319
a number of years ago so it was really

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,319
her coming from a big data technology

65
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,679
philanthropy angle me coming from my

66
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,598
background in medicine and running

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
clinical trials and we realized that the

68
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,959
academic model had a lot of shortcomings

69
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,439
and that there was a lot that we could

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,280
do in the private sector with radical

71
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,719
science to serve brands to help them get

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,719
the data they needed to make better

73
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,239
products to make claims to grow their

74
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,439
business

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,840
there's a flood of people welcome

76
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,680
they must have been holding the doors

77
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,200
now you guys were in line to get in

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
lined up half an hour in advance thank

79
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,359
you

80
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,719
uh okay so how do we achieve these

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,080
efficiencies in radical science this

82
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,159
will make sense when i start talking

83
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,879
about our aces data you know how is it

84
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,318
that we pulled off a 3 000 person trial

85
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,639
well the first thing is we go completely

86
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,560
virtual you know what what is it and it

87
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,919
makes sense that we started this company

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,199
during covet

89
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,559
so you know what happens when you

90
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,878
eliminate all the physical

91
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,120
infrastructure of a university all the

92
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,239
infrastructure of hospitals and clinics

93
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,080
all of the

94
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,680
nursing staff the research coordinators

95
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,519
the doctors all these people that drive

96
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,800
up the cost and complexity what if you

97
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,400
go completely

98
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,319
virtual and then what if you go

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,239
completely direct to consumer in this

100
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,199
case radical science we're the ones

101
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,200
directly communicating with a consumer

102
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,039
to recruit them into the study we're the

103
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,199
ones directly shipping them product

104
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,280
we're the ones directly collecting data

105
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,639
from them and at the end of the study we

106
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,400
do something special we analyze all

107
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,199
their data and every participant in our

108
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,039
study actually gets a health report back

109
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,719
that tracks their usage their outcomes

110
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,479
and gives them a sense of how they

111
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,840
experienced the product we actually

112
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,840
don't pay any participants in our

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,280
studies which is very unlike traditional

114
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,640
clinical research

115
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,799
the third thing is because of these two

116
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,958
features we can go large scale and as

117
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,799
soon as you go large scale the power of

118
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,640
your study increases the confidence in

119
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,560
your results increase

120
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,199
and furthermore you can now start

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,158
getting at that precision medicine

122
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,079
angle

123
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,878
you need large amounts of data to know

124
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,200
that people of this type of

125
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,959
ethnicity this type of gender

126
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,399
respond in this manner you can only get

127
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,079
there with large amounts of data and the

128
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,079
last thing is this intentional

129
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,160
heterogeneity for many for pretty much

130
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,400
the advent of trials they were

131
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,720
intentionally homogeneous

132
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,319
because the sample sizes were small you

133
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,840
had to make all the participants look

134
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,439
the same or else there'd be too much

135
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,519
noise in the data well because we went

136
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,360
large we can have noise in the data and

137
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,680
still make conclusions so we have this

138
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,439
intentional heterogeneity people from

139
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,639
different geographies people of

140
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,399
different demographics different

141
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,120
lifestyles different pre-existing health

142
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,719
conditions

143
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,360
all right so what was radical aces all

144
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,800
about aces stands for advancing cbd

145
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,759
education and science and i think it was

146
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
actually

147
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,840
michelle from my team here who helped us

148
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,279
come up with that acronym

149
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,399
and i know a lot of you are familiar

150
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,839
with this but just to give you some

151
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,599
brief background on why we thought it

152
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,079
was important for us to run this aces

153
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,039
study so it was it's very difficult even

154
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,399
to this day for universities to study

155
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,680
cbd

156
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,399
here's why

157
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,439
2018 farm bills cbd no longer controlled

158
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,239
substance

159
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,680
however that same year epidialex was

160
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,918
approved and there's actually a law from

161
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,519
the fda whereas if you have a naturally

162
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,839
occurring product

163
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,839
and someone turns it into a drug

164
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,359
and it wasn't yet sold as a supplement

165
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,399
it basically is banned forever as a

166
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,400
supplement

167
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,918
however if it was already being sold as

168
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,239
a supplement and someone turns it into

169
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,399
drug both are allowed to coexist

170
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,720
and in the case of cbd

171
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,918
the fda is saying you know this pharma

172
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,240
company began their clinical trials

173
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,159
much earlier than 2014 and no one really

174
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,079
has presented evidence that cbd was sold

175
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
widely as a supplement prior to that so

176
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,680
the fda keeps saying you know drug

177
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
preclusion drug percussion you look up

178
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
any of the warning letters you're saying

179
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,079
cbd is a drug it can't be sold as a

180
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
supplement

181
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,599
and so what happens is when you're now a

182
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,918
university

183
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,439
you can't study cbd unless you study it

184
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,359
under an investigational new drug

185
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,839
framework which is dramatically more

186
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,000
expensive complex and the brand that

187
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,399
wants to give you their product to study

188
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
has to now basically treat their product

189
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,279
as a drug it has to be manufactured a

190
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
certain way needs a certain amount of

191
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,198
regulatory filings basically a

192
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,960
non-starter for vast majority of brands

193
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,038
that's why universities including while

194
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,279
i was at ucla we could not run a single

195
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:30,719
study on any commercially available cbd

196
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,719
product it's very frustrating

197
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
so that's the context you know thousands

198
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
of products being sold to tens of

199
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
millions of americans universities can't

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
really study any of these commercially

201
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,799
available products so when we came onto

202
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
the scene with aces our company was

203
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,478
brand new uh we had a small skeleton

204
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,079
crew of employees and we said hey let's

205
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,439
just go run the largest clinical trial

206
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,120
and cbd ever done in history it'll be

207
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,918
fine oh

208
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,598
well

209
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,079
we'll do it we'll get it done um here's

210
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,319
the research team so uh you'll notice

211
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,000
some of these names on here ethan russo

212
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,439
one of our co-authors and collaborators

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,959
here in the audience

214
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,199
as well but it was a wide variety of

215
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,359
people our internal scientists as well

216
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,759
as a variety of our collaborators from

217
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,879
academia you might actually recognize

218
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,560
some of these names on here

219
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,439
all right so what did we do so this is a

220
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,680
four-week open label study open label

221
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,680
meaning the participants knew what they

222
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,519
were getting and in this case our goal

223
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,840
with this study was actually to generate

224
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,598
what i often refer to as real world

225
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,719
evidence of outcomes because when

226
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,639
someone walks into a grocery store picks

227
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
up a bottle of cbd

228
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,918
they know that it's cbd

229
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,079
and they're going to use it in a certain

230
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,560
way so our intention with this study was

231
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,560
to try to capture and mimic what's

232
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,639
happening when people are buying a cbd

233
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,598
product they're not blinded to it they

234
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,160
know what it is so we kept it open label

235
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,800
but what we did was we randomized people

236
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,199
to receive different cbd products as

237
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,280
well as to serve as a control arm in

238
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,840
this study and so we recruited about

239
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,878
3000 people to get into the study you

240
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,519
had to have at least one symptom of

241
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,120
sleep disturbance pain or anxiety so you

242
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,639
had to have something in those three

243
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,879
categories that you wanted to correct

244
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,639
and our main thing to look at was we

245
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,319
were actually interested in a holistic

246
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,319
outcome measure we wanted to look at

247
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,759
people's well-being because well-being

248
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,879
is often that

249
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,360
uh

250
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,560
manifestation of a bunch of different

251
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
underlying

252
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,478
changes in your life and then the

253
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
secondary outcomes was we also wanted to

254
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,800
look at specifically your pain your

255
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,799
sleep your anxiety how did that change

256
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,959
as well

257
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,478
and and yes this was by

258
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,439
well over an order of magnitude the

259
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,839
largest randomized clinical trial in cbd

260
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,120
ever conducted

261
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,800
so here were the key health outcome

262
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,159
measures we used we used validated

263
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,879
health outcome measures so it wasn't

264
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,039
just

265
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,799
on a scale of one to five like how how's

266
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,559
your anxiety doing today

267
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,278
we use these validated outcome measures

268
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,119
so these have been run and developed by

269
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,200
academia they've been used in many other

270
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,399
clinical trials and when they're

271
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,040
validated you now know that when a score

272
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,200
say the the promised sleep quality score

273
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,799
when that moves a certain amount you

274
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
know if that's a clinically meaningful

275
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,559
difference and now that kind of serves

276
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,159
as a benchmark where you can go look at

277
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,559
other interventions done in other

278
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,159
studies and you see ah that intervention

279
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,559
changed that validated outcome measure

280
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,000
this much and in our study it changes

281
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,079
this much and now that gives you a way

282
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,919
to kind of compare across studies so

283
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,519
it's important to use these outcome

284
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,519
measures we also looked at side effects

285
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
one thing i want to briefly mention is

286
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,439
the timeline so from when we

287
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
came up with the idea to when we

288
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,000
completed the study was like about nine

289
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,519
months

290
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
um and this is a type of trial that

291
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,959
could have easily taken five

292
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,639
to plus years to conduct uh and publish

293
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,479
uh in other settings so we were pretty

294
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,838
proud of that and again our company was

295
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,000
a couple months old when we came up with

296
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,760
this idea i think we had four employees

297
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,759
so things were a little crazy

298
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,000
all right so here were the brands that

299
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,759
participated these were the sponsors of

300
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,519
aces

301
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,200
and some of the brands i think are

302
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,839
actually exhibiting here i've seen the

303
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,040
tealer team walking around but these are

304
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,839
the brands that participated you'll

305
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,838
notice uh different form factors

306
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,320
so we wanted a variety of different

307
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,000
products because the thousands of cbd

308
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
products that any american combined they

309
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,879
come in all

310
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,039
shapes and sizes and formulations and

311
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,799
dosages and form factors so this was

312
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,519
again real world evidence that we were

313
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,519
trying to capture

314
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,759
uh again form factor wise they were fast

315
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,159
melt tablets capsules tinctures softgels

316
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,480
gummies oral sprays

317
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,120
there was also different dosages

318
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,720
across the board as well as spectrum

319
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,560
some some of these products were full

320
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,959
some were broad some were isolated so

321
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,359
that was another one of our hypotheses

322
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,239
how is spectrum going to impact

323
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,240
the outcome measures

324
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,159
all right speaking of demographics again

325
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,479
we wanted intentional heterogeneity

326
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,838
and if you look at clinical studies

327
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,278
historically

328
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,240
women have largely been uh excluded and

329
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,519
underrepresented in trials uh for

330
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,039
various reasons i'm not going to get

331
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,679
into today but you can look it up as to

332
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,759
reasons why um so in our study we're

333
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,679
like let's try to get equal

334
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,879
representation of women so we went out

335
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,559
to recruit

336
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,159
we leaned heavily on recruitment

337
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,838
channels that we knew would hit women

338
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,919
and we were actually too successful

339
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,079
because like 90 of the study turned out

340
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,000
to be women

341
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,799
so we succeeded but not in the way that

342
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,720
we thought we would um now to be fair

343
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,039
your average cbd user

344
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
tends to skew female and women tend to

345
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,958
be the purchasers of health and wellness

346
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,120
products uh for the household but it

347
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,399
still doesn't explain this full 90 our

348
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,360
studies that we're running now we've

349
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,639
gotten back to 50 50 gender balance but

350
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,399
in this study definitely was skewed

351
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,278
female but we are proud that we got

352
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,278
people across all 50 u.s states which

353
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,360
never happens in a clinical trial

354
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,360
for a site-based trial at a university

355
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
every single person in that study comes

356
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,759
from a 10-mile driving radius of your

357
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,399
university so you're not hitting people

358
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,159
that come from diverse socioeconomic

359
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,720
background diverse environmental

360
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:14,639
exposures lifestyle cultural factors all

361
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,639
these things can impact our health

362
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:22,919
and then we had good uh

363
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,919
race and ethnic diversity as well

364
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,278
um very briefly what were we analyzing

365
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,278
so we were using this linear mixed model

366
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,399
approach

367
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,000
it's kind of the gold standard for

368
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,759
analyzing this type of data from a

369
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
biostatistical standpoint and we did a

370
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,720
couple comparisons so what we did was we

371
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,078
took every single product in the study

372
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,800
and we compared it to the control group

373
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,838
then we analyzed if we clustered the

374
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,599
products

375
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,360
by say their spectrum broad full isolate

376
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
by their dosage

377
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,320
how did those clusters compare to one

378
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,920
another

379
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
and then we looked at the

380
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,120
characteristics of people in the study

381
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,078
gender

382
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,679
cbd use and age and were those

383
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,679
predictive of whether you would have a

384
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,159
better or worse outcome again this is

385
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,000
about precision medicine

386
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,360
the right person the right dosage the

387
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,839
right product for the right condition

388
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,800
that's what we're trying to get at

389
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,880
so here are the uh outcome measures we

390
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,278
looked at across the board

391
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,600
um so you'll look at the highlighted

392
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,519
line is the control group so this group

393
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,120
was recruited in the study and they

394
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,679
agreed to fill out surveys but they did

395
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,480
not receive any product and the reason

396
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,919
you use a control group like this is if

397
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,759
something happens in the macro

398
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,559
environment and you see the control

399
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:43,039
groups anxiety spike or maybe get a lot

400
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,559
better say it spikes when the war in

401
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,439
ukraine

402
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,518
happens it anxiety might fall when the

403
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,120
code vaccine comes out that's important

404
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,519
to know because the people that might be

405
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,278
getting cbd if you see their anxiety

406
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,799
spike or their anxiety declined you need

407
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,198
to make sure that it's not due to a

408
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,679
macro factor so you compare them to the

409
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,120
control group so in this case well-being

410
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,319
increased dramatically across the board

411
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,198
it was quite

412
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,800
statistically significant across uh this

413
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,159
is where we aggregated the data from all

414
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,399
the products

415
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,559
anxiety plummeted and it was quite

416
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,839
significant as well that's the chart on

417
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,838
your right

418
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,680
and then if we look at sleep uh sleep

419
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,519
disturbance aka

420
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,359
dropping is good so there was less sleep

421
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,159
disturbance in the people receiving

422
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,079
product as well as pain decreased as

423
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,719
well and notice in all these charts

424
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,479
there's a very rapid drop in the first

425
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,480
week to 10 days

426
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,079
and then it continues to improve but at

427
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,039
a much slower ramp so we saw across the

428
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,958
board that these health outcomes most of

429
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,919
the improvements were seen in the first

430
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,198
week

431
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,958
and then had a little gradual

432
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,679
improvement to the end of the of the

433
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,679
four-week study

434
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,399
so to recap you know what we just saw in

435
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
those charts

436
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,759
the most

437
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,240
the most beneficial effect we saw was

438
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,240
actually for anxiety so 63 of people had

439
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,519
a clinically meaningful improvement in

440
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,799
their anxiety followed by sleep 61 of

441
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,120
people had a clinically meaningful

442
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,599
improvement and then pain

443
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,519
was the still improved but compared to

444
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,680
sleep anxiety had less improvement 47

445
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,519
about less than half of people had a

446
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,359
meaningful improvement in their pain and

447
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,879
clinically meaningful when you use these

448
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,399
validated outcome measures is

449
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,639
scientifically defined

450
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,958
it means a significant palpable change

451
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,959
that would affect their quality of life

452
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,320
so basically we're seeing people are

453
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,078
indeed getting better across all these

454
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,920
domains including their well-being that

455
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:46,319
holistic measure of their health as well

456
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,479
now we found no differences when we

457
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,480
clustered people by

458
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,639
age or by gender or by prior cbd use so

459
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,320
none of those variables were predictive

460
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,959
if someone was going to have a better or

461
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,079
worse outcome from cbd so that was an

462
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,599
interesting finding from the study

463
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:04,719
and also because

464
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,040
i don't think there was a talk here

465
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,639
today but you do find in mouse studies

466
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,319
that there are sex differences when it

467
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,839
comes to cannabinoids most of that study

468
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,600
has been on thc

469
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,759
specifically but there is this

470
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,000
theoretical sex difference that could uh

471
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
occur

472
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,599
side effects were pretty mild across the

473
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,519
board about 10 percent of people had a

474
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,000
side effect and pretty much all side

475
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,240
effects were mild most common ones were

476
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,320
digestive in nature

477
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,480
gas flastulence

478
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,199
and diarrhea bloating which is

479
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,000
in line with what you see in the

480
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,000
clinical trials of cbd say on epidiolex

481
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,240
you had the most common side effects

482
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,559
were often related to digestive

483
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,560
issues

484
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,320
okay so a couple caveats here

485
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,958
first thing this is an open label trial

486
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,639
so you can't disentangle the placebo

487
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,319
effect here

488
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
um a lot of the studies we're running

489
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,079
now are blinded and placebo controlled

490
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,240
so in those instances you can

491
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,838
disentangle the placebo effect and the

492
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,519
you know and so the studies that we're

493
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,798
running for brands right now are

494
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,160
intended to

495
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,838
show that their product is indeed better

496
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,439
than placebo and kind of make these you

497
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,678
know strong claims

498
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,079
um another caveat here is again we had

499
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,280
you know over 90 of the participants

500
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,639
were female potentially that's skewing

501
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,078
the data it would have been nice to have

502
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,400
more male representation in the study

503
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,720
and here's the other thing

504
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,720
um

505
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,639
before i show you the the next slide

506
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,080
keep in mind that

507
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,759
yes we grouped all these products

508
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,079
by dosage

509
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,599
and then we tried to see

510
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,798
if there were any

511
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,399
uh differences in outcomes but just

512
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,119
because you grouped all these products

513
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,679
by dosage like lower dose products

514
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,759
moderate and high dose the products

515
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,919
still differed in other attributes the

516
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:01,679
form factor was different the spectrum

517
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,520
was different so you had multi you had

518
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,200
multiple

519
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,200
criteria that were different between

520
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,600
products so even when we held and

521
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,759
compared one criteria at a time

522
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,639
just because for example

523
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,359
uh

524
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,840
the spectrum of the product didn't seem

525
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,359
to make a difference it doesn't mean

526
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,439
in this in this study it's hard to

527
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,639
actually conclude that the entourage

528
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,840
effect doesn't work and that spectrum

529
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
doesn't work

530
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,279
right and it's because when you again

531
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,919
group all the products by say full

532
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,918
spectrum broad and isolate and you see

533
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,600
that there's no major differences across

534
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,360
the board when you group them that way

535
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,759
these products are still quite different

536
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,159
in dose and form factor so maybe

537
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,798
the full spec product did indeed work

538
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,840
better but that product was a lower dose

539
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,960
and so that's why you don't see a

540
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,599
difference when you compare it to a

541
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,759
higher dose isolate in aggregate

542
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,759
so

543
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,880
and so here were the final findings so

544
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,720
again all this all the products across

545
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,360
the group improvements in

546
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,319
well-being pain sleep anxiety pretty

547
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,159
rare and mild side effects there were no

548
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,000
characteristics in the participants that

549
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,960
we could find that could predict whether

550
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,440
they could

551
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,279
were more or less likely to benefit we

552
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,200
did not find any differences when we

553
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,918
grouped the products by spectrum

554
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
so

555
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,840
the full spectrum products we studied

556
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,599
did not outperform the broad did not

557
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,759
outperform the isolate and none were

558
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,199
better or worse in aggregate

559
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,319
so that was an interesting finding from

560
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,919
this one thing we did find

561
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,599
is that

562
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,440
dose was not king and in fact there were

563
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,439
products that had lower doses of cbd

564
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,120
that were often outperforming products

565
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,880
with higher doses of cbd

566
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,719
and the way we had to run this study was

567
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,840
we had to anonymize and aggregate all

568
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,319
the data so we're not allowed to

569
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,439
actually tell you which specific brands

570
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:52,240
were outperforming once uh other ones

571
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,840
but what we can tell you is that the

572
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,120
lower dose products some of them were

573
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,119
beating the higher dose products and

574
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,119
maybe it's because their formulation

575
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,959
allowed for better absorption

576
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,319
maybe it was because the spectrum that

577
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,440
they had

578
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:08,000
uh was able to counteract the the fact

579
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,480
that they had a lower dose for example

580
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
so again um one thing you common

581
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
commonly hear from scientists is every

582
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,640
gate i forget who said this and i'm

583
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,798
totally stealing it but it's like every

584
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,880
great study warrants like four more so

585
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,200
this is our first shot across the bow

586
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,280
we've since followed up this study with

587
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,120
trials encompassing another probably 10

588
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,200
000 people studying minor cannabinoids

589
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,719
cbd products etc

590
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,400
so we hope that there's just more and

591
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,480
more science and research that can come

592
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,200
out um from here

593
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,240
so with that

594
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,038
i believe we have time to take some time

595
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,798
for questions so

596
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,200
don't leave me hanging who's got

597
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:45,200
questions

598
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,038
or maybe my presentation was that good

599
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
you you're

600
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,000
stunned silence

601
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,199
that was excellent talk um so um i was

602
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,359
curious so you're doing everything

603
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,600
virtually here um how do you keep from

604
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,240
biasing your sample size of folks who

605
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,199
can only get on virtually for example

606
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,720
sure so the the uh to participate in the

607
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,640
study we didn't even want to force

608
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,400
people to download an app i don't know

609
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,159
if you've ever had a parent call you

610
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,400
trying to figure out their i their you

611
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,559
know apple store login and stuff

612
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,840
so everyone could participate as long as

613
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,440
they basically had internet and they

614
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,119
didn't even need a phone you could

615
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,759
participate via text message you could

616
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,279
participate via email that and email

617
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,640
you're checking from your phone or your

618
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,480
laptop so as long as you have internet

619
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,038
and some device that could get some

620
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,038
communication you can participate

621
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,879
typically what you see in clinical

622
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,960
trials is that rural populations are not

623
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,039
represented 20 of our participants came

624
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,200
from rural populations which is really

625
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,519
impressive and so i think from the that

626
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,000
diversity standpoint anyone that wanted

627
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,679
to join could pretty much participate

628
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,798
in the in terms of

629
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,080
the

630
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:56,079
bias question here

631
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,079
the way that we again because it was an

632
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,399
open label study you can't take out the

633
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,279
placebo effect but because we randomize

634
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,120
people

635
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,038
to the different products

636
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,158
any confounding variables are kind of

637
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,960
spread evenly across the 13 products and

638
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,919
brands therefore if any brands

639
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,159
did have superior outcomes you can say

640
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,840
that you know both those products had

641
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,440
similar participants randomized to them

642
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,000
and any differences you see is not

643
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,360
because these participants also took

644
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,440
supplements or drugs because that should

645
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:29,759
have been equal between all the products

646
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,919
jeff thank you for your talk and the

647
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,480
work that you're doing uh

648
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,759
you showed in one slide that there was a

649
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,839
significant

650
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,000
uh some efficacy in the beginning for

651
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,319
the first week was the dosing protocol

652
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,279
the same throughout the entire study or

653
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,558
did you adjust the dosing uh suggestion

654
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,639
and

655
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,079
it was consistent across the whole study

656
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,080
so for all the out all the health

657
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,558
outcome measures we saw the most of the

658
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,000
improvements happen in the first week

659
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,639
the participants were actually

660
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,960
instructed to use the products

661
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,799
as the products were labeled and

662
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,038
suggested the usage so effectively we

663
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,519
were letting the brands drive

664
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,279
the recommended usage by following the

665
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,240
instructions of the products again this

666
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:15,119
study was all about real world data

667
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,880
so all the participants were instructed

668
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,798
to look at the

669
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,760
suggested servings and usage of the

670
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,599
product and use it accordingly and

671
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,279
again across the board we saw that all

672
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,399
the improvements are most of the

673
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,839
improvements were happening in that

674
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,679
first week and then again a little bit

675
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,839
improvement that continued all the way

676
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,840
to the tail end um of the 30 days

677
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,918
thank you very much for your study um i

678
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,278
think that we do need a lot more real

679
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,759
world evidence so thank you again

680
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:46,000
second question or first question is um

681
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,599
what is your intent is there any intent

682
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,839
to look at the formulations the

683
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,399
difference between the olive oils the

684
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:55,119
mct oils things like that shelf

685
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,798
stabilities and if you can what's the

686
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,038
future of you just brought up a very

687
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,038
good point this one study at

688
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,440
is going to bring up four more studies

689
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,440
so what is the future for a radical in

690
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,038
your um

691
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
your group sir yeah it's a great

692
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,720
question um

693
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:14,000
we thought about trying to analyze the

694
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,759
data based on the formulations um some

695
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,640
products were using olive oil some were

696
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,079
using mct oil some were uh there was no

697
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,759
they weren't oil based right they were

698
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,000
sitting in a gummy matrix things like

699
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,038
that and there was just too many

700
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,278
different

701
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,119
carrier matrixes and oils it wouldn't

702
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,319
have been a useful cluster

703
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,519
um and so that's not necessarily uh

704
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,359
something that we can address with this

705
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,240
one study but going forward what we're

706
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,678
running studies on is you know we're

707
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,679
adding in blinding or adding an

708
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,360
additional control measures and the

709
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,440
brands that are coming to us sometimes

710
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,439
they're doing their own

711
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,080
they have their own hypotheses so for

712
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,960
instance their brand's coming to us and

713
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:55,199
they'll hand us six different products

714
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,038
and it's the same cannabinoids and it's

715
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
the same dose but they're using six

716
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,319
different carrier oils and they want to

717
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,839
figure out which one works the best if

718
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,038
at all and so those are the studies

719
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,199
we're running now and because we're

720
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:08,079
blinding participants to them then we're

721
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,679
really factoring out any sort of bias so

722
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,759
those are the studies we're running now

723
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,519
to answer some of those questions but

724
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,599
it's being driven by the brands so we're

725
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,119
really here to be there kind of

726
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,719
you know they're there

727
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,439
to carry out what that what their goals

728
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,839
are is an r d goal is it a claim goal so

729
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,120
yeah great question

730
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,639
and i think

731
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,759
yeah

732
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,360
thank you

733
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,319
first um

734
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,240
it's

735
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,669
you've just turned clinical research on

736
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,359
his head congratulations

737
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:41,600
[Applause]

738
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,879
secondly uh excellent vision and great

739
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,798
work

740
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,400
my question is

741
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:47,440
how many of the products

742
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,240
had

743
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,840
little to no effect

744
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,278
um well so this was an open every single

745
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,798
product had a

746
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,679
quite

747
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:02,240
significant improvement

748
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,759
um all 13 products across the board so

749
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,278
both in aggregate they all did really

750
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,000
well and then individually there wasn't

751
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,839
a single product that did not create

752
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,798
significant improvements across the

753
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,959
board

754
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,519
but again it's an open label study

755
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,919
so and if you look at

756
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,240
you know people's belief in cbd it's

757
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,480
high right now so again you you we can't

758
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
disentangle how much of that improvement

759
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,839
was due to what's 10 of that improvement

760
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,319
driven by the placebo effect was it 20

761
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,720
was it 30 percent we don't know um but

762
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,480
there's a series of blinded randomized

763
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,440
trials that we're running right now

764
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,200
actually they're already finished we're

765
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,880
just analyzing the data so those are

766
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,000
pretty much the first blinded placebo

767
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,520
placebo-controlled trials on cbd testing

768
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,759
the dosage ranges that consumers are

769
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,000
using which is well under 100 milligrams

770
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,759
and testing it for some of these common

771
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,038
conditions so it's exciting i can't wait

772
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,480
like literally every day my team's like

773
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,480
is it data ready to look at you like

774
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,720
what what's going on

775
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,720
so

776
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,879
we did not see any loss of effect and in

777
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,880
our this was a relatively you know 30

778
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,559
days is still decent it's not a one-week

779
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,720
study it's 30 days

780
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,240
we've run 60 day studies in the past and

781
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,440
we've seen that the effect is actually

782
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,200
sustained

783
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,519
all the way up to 60 days we've not run

784
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,679
studies beyond 60 days

785
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,679
so

786
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:22,798
yeah thanks wonderful talk

787
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,559
my question is a two part one is um just

788
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,720
general uh understanding of the

789
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,558
nomenclature and two is logistics so

790
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,079
when i think full spectrum i'm thinking

791
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,200
maybe there's a little bit of thc in

792
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,439
some of these products

793
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,919
and how do you go about distributing

794
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,880
products that contain um

795
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,720
amounts of thc to all 50 states you know

796
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,000
and this is where it's about risk

797
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,640
tolerance so again if uh in this case

798
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,398
our interpretation of the of the 2018

799
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,720
farm bills that you can have permissible

800
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,038
amounts of thc so in this case all the

801
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,038
thc content was quite low well well

802
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,200
below 0.3

803
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,480
um and so in that instance our rationale

804
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,319
as researchers was these products

805
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,240
already being sold consumers already

806
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,158
buying them so us as researchers should

807
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,558
be allowed to take possession and ship

808
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,679
them across state lines so that's not a

809
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:08,960
risk that a university would be willing

810
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,200
to take but it's nice when you don't

811
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,640
take federal funding so

812
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,640
yeah thanks appreciate it

813
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,240
hi

814
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:19,599
awesome love

815
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,679
and the question is i'm kind of a

816
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,879
one-note song like most people know are

817
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,720
you doing any

818
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,159
trials for people living with dementia

819
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,120
or alzheimer's so the one the one

820
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,520
restriction on how we conduct our

821
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,798
research is we can't study

822
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,960
diseases

823
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,720
without triggering an ind and as soon as

824
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,798
we trigger an ind it means that the

825
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,480
brands that are want us to do studies

826
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,319
for them they're subject to an ind as

827
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,079
well which means they now have to file a

828
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:47,599
ton of paper and now imagine a cbd

829
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,398
company trying to file an ind with the

830
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:53,439
fda it's a non-starter

831
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,278
so we have to be very clever

832
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,600
with how we

833
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,200
study conditions without actually

834
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,199
studying diseases

835
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,558
so um so so the short answer is no we

836
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
haven't necessarily been studying these

837
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,440
products on people with dementia but

838
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,398
what i would what i would do what i

839
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
would do

840
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,119
is i would

841
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
do a big recruitment for anyone who

842
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,879
believes they're suffering from

843
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,480
poor memory cool

844
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,840
regardless of how you've been diagnosed

845
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,960
right get all those people into the

846
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,199
study

847
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,440
and then after that fact some subset of

848
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
them may or may not have certain

849
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,880
diseases but i didn't recruit for that

850
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,120
disease awesome i'm not subject to an

851
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,720
indeed super clever so yeah we get to

852
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,479
attempt that that's theoretically we

853
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,558
want to try that yeah

854
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,480
of course

855
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,599
thank you for sharing this information

856
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,599
um i was curious if you'd had any follow

857
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,319
up with the participants after the study

858
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,158
concluded and if they continued using

859
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,678
the products or if they continued seeing

860
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,760
benefits after they stopped using

861
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,759
products yeah so you brought up a great

862
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,720
question just this week our research

863
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,798
team was like you know we should

864
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,399
probably check in with the participants

865
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,079
and just maybe try to collect a little

866
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,479
more information now that they're six

867
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:00,558
months in what i will say is

868
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,960
a majority of participants in the study

869
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,480
are opting in wanting to continue to use

870
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,480
the product and wanting the brands to

871
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,519
reach out and contact them

872
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,919
a significant majority so they they seem

873
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,599
to be pretty happy with with uh the

874
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,038
process but it's a great point we we

875
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,038
probably should start following up now

876
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,640
that more time has elapsed to see like

877
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:20,640
what's going on thanks yeah

878
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,679
hi my name is valentia and i have a

879
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,599
high-end dispensary

880
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,240
located in carmel california i've been

881
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,719
in the medical space since uh well over

882
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,798
a decade i'm going on my 12th year so of

883
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,399
course when we first started in 2008

884
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,000
when i had the first non-profit on the

885
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,000
central coast

886
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,079
we did see

887
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,599
sleep and pain being number one since

888
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:48,240
pandemic we've seen of course um anxiety

889
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,158
be number one dr mushulum taught me two

890
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,079
and a half years ago when i met with him

891
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,360
that anywhere between 20 and 30

892
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,480
milligrams

893
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,959
of cbd full spectrum

894
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,480
will help not only with my ms which i've

895
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,720
had for 30 years i used to be in a

896
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,278
wheelchair but i'm confused because when

897
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,640
i look at your study i see a lot of hemp

898
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,679
product in there

899
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,799
we were told or am i hearing you say let

900
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,759
me ask the question that the hemp

901
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,359
lines

902
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:20,079
part of the study the same as a thc line

903
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,038
great so first off all of these products

904
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,519
had

905
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:26,079
uh were hemp products

906
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,240
and the ones that did have thc had tiny

907
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,639
amounts of thc

908
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,558
and at least in our analysis when we

909
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,120
compared all the products that were full

910
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,278
spectrum aka had some amount of thc

911
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,518
with the broad and isolate we did not

912
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,240
see significant differences

913
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,558
in

914
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,720
their outcomes but they didn't just

915
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,240
differ in spectrum they differed in dose

916
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,880
and form factors so it could have been

917
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,960
that the spectrums were outperforming

918
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,480
but they were lower dosed and that's why

919
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,480
they were able to mess so that that we

920
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,319
weren't able to this study wasn't

921
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,640
designed to be able to address that

922
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,278
particular issue but yeah in this case

923
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,720
very low amounts of thc like pretty

924
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,880
pretty tiny amounts yet people were

925
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,720
seeing these significant outcomes that

926
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,480
probably explains why they weren't uh

927
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,600
being effective for sleep you need some

928
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,399
thc for sleep after pain but

929
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,158
potentially um i mean in this case you

930
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,319
know anxiety was the best performing

931
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,159
outcome followed by sleep followed by

932
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,398
pain um and i think there's just not

933
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,320
enough research so um i mean clearly

934
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,278
there is clinical trial data that thc

935
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,119
helps with pain the thc helps with sleep

936
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,159
and there's that data doesn't exist yet

937
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,879
for cbd excuse me with him then taking

938
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,480
such a priority in this role where does

939
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,720
it leave those of us that are licensed

940
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,159
that have spent a decade and millions of

941
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,880
dollars getting licensed in the cannabis

942
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,039
space in terms of i'm the only one

943
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,399
in the entirety of california that has a

944
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,798
pharmacist and nurses together

945
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,839
my question then where does this study

946
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:57,119
thank you

947
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:59,199
thank you and and a female and so where

948
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,319
does the study leave our patient

949
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,558
community

950
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,639
other than more confused well

951
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,720
well here's the thing i mean

952
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,278
there are many people who can't access

953
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,679
thc and the best thing they could get

954
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,440
right now is a cbd product that they

955
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,399
trust and maybe buy online or buy in a

956
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,399
store

957
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,879
for folks who do have access to thc i

958
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,239
think they should you know try it and

959
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,679
they might find that one works better

960
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,038
than another clearly there is more

961
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,798
clinical data

962
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,240
rigorous randomized controlled trial

963
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:29,359
blinded data that thc does indeed help

964
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,200
with pain

965
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,558
and can help with the onset of sleep

966
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,558
making you fall now whether it gives you

967
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,079
better sleep is a different question but

968
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,558
there's data that it shows it decreases

969
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,759
sleep latency that data does not exist

970
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,440
for cbd

971
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,440
this data is some of the closest data

972
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,919
we've gotten to actually what does cb of

973
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,080
cbd objectively do at these doses well

974
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,600
under 100 milligrams for these

975
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,558
conditions so i think that the answer is

976
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:55,278
if you can access thc try it if you have

977
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,599
intolerable side effects then maybe

978
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,119
try a predominant cbd product and if

979
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,839
you're in a state that doesn't have

980
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:04,000
access to cannabis then you might only

981
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:07,519
have options such as cbd

982
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,440
thank you yeah of course

983
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,918
all right and last but not least

984
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,000
all right thank you very much um

985
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,679
my question so i believe what you should

986
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,159
the results you showed us were comparing

987
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,200
the the mean scores on the various

988
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,240
measures

989
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,319
um have you also looked at mean change

990
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,000
so we basically took every participant's

991
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,720
baseline right across the different

992
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,480
health outcomes and tracked it each week

993
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,719
so we were assessing their severity of

994
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,000
symptoms every week okay but you

995
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,519
mentioned that not not all the

996
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,599
participants had a clinically

997
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,519
significant improvement did you also

998
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,679
look at the fraction of it of of

999
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,079
individuals who had that clinical

1000
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,320
improvement and maybe that varied across

1001
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,440
the participant categories it was a

1002
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,480
little muffled but i think you were

1003
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,079
saying did we look at of those that

1004
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,639
didn't have a clinically meaningful

1005
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,639
improvement

1006
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,639
well it was just a response variable

1007
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,078
that was either

1008
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:04,319
yes they had a clinical improvement or

1009
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:08,160
no they didn't oh i see so uh we could

1010
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,640
have reported the data as what their

1011
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,519
score change percentage was right so on

1012
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:16,400
average people's pain improved 30 things

1013
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,000
like that but in the world of

1014
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,000
uh medicine

1015
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,199
you these clinically meaningful cutoffs

1016
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,440
are more important because like i'll

1017
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,439
give an example right

1018
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,159
i have a new drug it'll improve your

1019
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,480
pain by 20 you're like oh 20 that's

1020
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,078
that's that's pretty cool um but it

1021
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,400
actually doesn't really hit the cutoff

1022
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,720
for what is clinically meaningful

1023
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,639
i think the cutoff's about 30

1024
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,719
and so what we went for in this study

1025
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,879
was to say hey if this were judged as a

1026
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:44,959
pharmaceutical drug how would a doctor

1027
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,440
evaluate it they would evaluate it based

1028
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,679
on the percentage of people using it

1029
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,838
that had a clinically meaningful

1030
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,960
difference in their pain or their sleep

1031
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,320
and their anxiety because if you just

1032
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,760
keep percentages your anxiety's ten

1033
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,559
percent better you're like oh that's

1034
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,680
pretty cool but does it warrant you

1035
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,358
paying money

1036
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,960
potentially having side effects to try

1037
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,480
this new product

1038
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,240
right so we basically converted the

1039
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,320
percentage changes and the mean score

1040
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,919
changes and saw

1041
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,519
how many of them hit that threshold for

1042
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,519
clinically meaningful and that's how we

1043
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,880
got these numbers right 63 of people in

1044
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,199
the study had a clinically meaningful

1045
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,640
improvement in anxiety if you had a

1046
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,199
pharma drug

1047
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:25,199
that could demonstrate that that is a

1048
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,399
that is a that is going to do very well

1049
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,480
and insurance companies would be happy

1050
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,838
to reimburse for it but again this was

1051
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,639
an open label

1052
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:34,400
study so some amount of that 63 percent

1053
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,239
of people

1054
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,680
some portion of that improvement was

1055
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,439
probably being driven by the placebo

1056
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,879
effect right just like anything just

1057
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,720
like anything that you study in an open

1058
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,800
label study whether it's a supplement or

1059
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,078
meditation or a pharma drug

1060
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,599
so that's why there needs to be

1061
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,000
additional studies on here and this was

1062
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,599
just our first shot across the bow so

1063
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,239
we're excited i mean in this last 30

1064
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,640
days alone we've probably run trials on

1065
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,519
6 000 people blinded randomized trials

1066
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,358
on cbd cbg cbn cbc so we're exploring a

1067
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,639
bunch of different

1068
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:03,598
products but there's literally an

1069
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,759
infinite

1070
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,240
there's like so much work to be done so

1071
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,480
we need help we need other researchers

1072
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,719
we need other people picking up and

1073
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,400
running studies too we can't do it alone

1074
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,118
so

1075
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,119
all right well thank you guys
